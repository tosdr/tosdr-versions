to Content are purchased as subscriptions for the term stated in the applicable Order Form or in the applicable online purchasing

portal, (b) subscriptions for Purchased Services may be added during a subscription term at the same pricing as the underlying

subscription pricing, prorated for the portion of that subscription term remaining at the time the subscriptions are added, and (c)

any added subscriptions will terminate on the same date as the underlying subscriptions. Customer agrees that its purchases are

not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments

made by SFDC regarding future functionality or features.

3.2 Usage Limits. Services and Content are subject to usage limits specified in Order Forms and Documentation. If Customer

exceeds a contractual usage limit, SFDC may work with Customer to seek to reduce Customer’s usage so that it conforms to

that limit. If, notwithstanding SFDC’s efforts, Customer is unable or unwilling to abide by a contractual usage limit, Customer

will execute an Order Form for additional quantities of the applicable Services or Content promptly upon SFDC’s request,

and/or pay any invoice for excess usage in accordance with the “Invoicing and Payment” section below.

3.3 Customer Responsibilities. Customer will (a) be responsible for Users’ compliance with this Agreement, Documentation and

Order Forms, (b) be responsible for the accuracy, quality and legality of Customer Data, the means by which Customer acquired

Customer Data, Customer’s use of Customer Data with the Services, and the interoperation of any Non-SFDC Applications

with which Customer uses Services or Content, (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use

of Services and Content, and notify SFDC promptly of any such unauthorized access or use, (d) use Services and Content only

in accordance with this Agreement, Documentation, the Acceptable Use and External Facing Services Policy and the Artificial

Intelligence Acceptable Use Policy both available at https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/agreements/, Order Forms and

applicable laws and government regulations, and (e) comply with terms of service of any Non-SFDC Applications with which

Customer uses Services or Content. Any use of the Services in breach of the foregoing by Customer or Users that in SFDC’s

judgment threatens the security, integrity or availability of SFDC’s services, may result in SFDC’s immediate suspension of the

Services, however SFDC will use commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances to provide Customer with notice

and an opportunity to remedy such violation or threat prior to any such suspension.

3.4 Usage Restrictions. Customer will not (a) make any Service or Content available to anyone other than Customer or Users, or

use any Service or Content for the benefit of anyone other than Customer or its Affiliates, unless expressly stated otherwise in

an Order Form or the Documentation, (b) sell, resell, license, sublicense, distribute, rent or lease any Service or Content, or

derivative works of a Service or any part, feature, function or user interface thereof, (i) copy Content except as permitted herein

build a competitive product or service, (2) build a product or service using similar ideas, features, functions or graphics of the

Service, (3) copy any ideas, features, functions or graphics of the Service, or (4) determine whether the Services are within the

scope of any patent.

3.5 Removal of Content and Non-SFDC Applications. If Customer receives notice, including from SFDC, that Content or a

Non-SFDC Application may no longer be used or must be removed, modified and/or disabled to avoid violating applicable law,

third-party rights, or the Acceptable Use and External Facing Services Policy, Customer will promptly do so. If Customer does

not take required action, including deleting any Content Customer may have downloaded from the Services, in accordance with

the above, or if in SFDC’s judgment continued violation is likely to reoccur, SFDC may disable the applicable Content, Service

and/or Non-SFDC Application. If requested by SFDC, Customer shall confirm deletion and discontinuance of use of such

Content and/or Non-SFDC Application in writing and SFDC shall be authorized to provide a copy of such confirmation to any

such third-party claimant or governmental authority, as applicable. In addition, if SFDC is required by any third-party rights

holder to remove Content, or receives information that Content provided to Customer may violate applicable law or third-party

rights, SFDC may discontinue Customer’s access to Content through the Services.

4. NON-SFDC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

4.1 Non-SFDC Products and Services. SFDC or third parties may make available (for example, through a Marketplace or

otherwise) third-party products or services, including, for example, Non-SFDC Applications and implementation and other

consulting services. Any acquisition by Customer of such products or services, and any exchange of data between Customer

and any Non-SFDC provider, product or service is solely between Customer and the applicable Non-SFDC provider. SFDC

does not warrant or support Non-SFDC Applications or other Non-SFDC products or services, whether or not they are

designated by SFDC as “certified” or otherwise, unless expressly provided otherwise in an Order Form. SFDC is not

responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data resulting from access by such Non-SFDC

Application or its provider.

4.2 Integration with Non-SFDC Applications. The Services may contain features designed to interoperate with Non-SFDC

Applications. SFDC cannot guarantee the continued availability of such Service features, and may cease providing them

without entitling Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation, if for example and without limitation, the provider of a

Non-SFDC Application ceases to make the Non-SFDC Application available for interoperation with the corresponding Service

features in a manner acceptable to SFDC.

5. FEES AND PAYMENT

5.1 Fees. Customer will pay all fees specified in Order Forms. Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (i) fees

are based on Services and Content subscriptions purchased and not actual usage, (ii) payment obligations are non- cancelable

and fees paid are non-refundable, and (iii) quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant subscription term.

5.2 Invoicing and Payment. Customer will provide SFDC with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase

order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to SFDC. If Customer provides credit card information to SFDC,

Customer authorizes SFDC to charge such credit card for all Purchased Services listed in the Order Form for the initial

subscription term and any renewal subscription term(s) as set forth in the “Term of Purchased Subscriptions” section below.

Such charges shall be made in advance, either annually or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the

applicable Order Form. If the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method other than a credit card, SFDC will

invoice Customer in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order

Form, invoiced fees are due net 30 days from the invoice date. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate

billing and contact information to SFDC and notifying SFDC of any changes to such information.

5.3 Overdue Charges. If any invoiced amount is not received by SFDC by the due date, then without limiting SFDC’s rights or

remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum

rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) SFDC may condition future subscription renewals and Order Forms on

payment terms shorter than those specified in the “Invoicing and Payment” section above.

5.4 Suspension of Service and Acceleration. If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other agreement for services is

30 days or more overdue, (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has authorized SFDC to charge to

Customer’s credit card), SFDC may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee

obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until

such amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose payment has

been declined, SFDC will give Customer at least 10 days’ prior notice that its account is overdue, in accordance with the

“Manner of Giving Notice” section below for billing notices, before suspending services to Customer.



SFDC-MSA, October 16, 2023 Page 5 of 15

5.5 Payment Disputes. SFDC will not exercise its rights under the “Overdue Charges” or “Suspension of Service and

Acceleration” section above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating

diligently to resolve the dispute.

5.6 Taxes. SFDC's fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for

example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”).

Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If SFDC has the legal obligation to pay or

collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, SFDC will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that

amount unless Customer provides SFDC with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.

For clarity, SFDC is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property and employees.

6. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES

6.1 Reservation of Rights. Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, SFDC, its Affiliates, its licensors and Content

Providers reserve all of their right, title and interest in and to the Services and Content, including all of their related intellectual

property rights. No rights are granted to Customer hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein.

6.2 Access to and Use of Content. Customer has the right to access and use applicable Content subject to the terms of applicable

Order Forms, this Agreement and the Documentation.

6.3 License by Customer to SFDC. Customer grants SFDC, its Affiliates and applicable contractors a worldwide, limited-term

license to host, copy, use, transmit, and display any Non-SFDC Applications and program code created by or for Customer

using a Service or for use by Customer with the Services, and Customer Data, each as appropriate for SFDC to provide and

ensure proper operation of the Services and associated systems in accordance with this Agreement. If Customer chooses to use

a Non-SFDC Application with a Service, Customer grants SFDC permission to allow the Non-SFDC Application and its

provider to access Customer Data and information about Customer’s usage of the Non-SFDC Application as appropriate for the

interoperation of that Non-SFDC Application with the Service. Subject to the limited licenses granted herein, SFDC acquires no

right, title or interest from Customer or its licensors under this Agreement in or to any Customer Data, Non-SFDC Application

or such program code.

6.4 License by Customer to Use Feedback. Customer grants to SFDC and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable,

royalty-free license to use, distribute, disclose, and make and incorporate into its services any suggestion, enhancement request,

recommendation, correction or other feedback provided by Customer or Users relating to the operation of SFDC’s or its

Affiliates’ services.

6.5 Federal Government End Use Provisions. SFDC provides the Services, including related software and technology, for

ultimate federal government end use in accordance with the following: The Services consist of “commercial items,” as defined

at FAR 2.101. In accordance with FAR 12.211-12.212 and DFARS 227.7102-4 and 227.7202-4, as applicable, the rights of the

U.S. Government to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose commercial computer software, commercial

computer software documentation, and technical data furnished in connection with the Services shall be as provided in this

Agreement, except that, for U.S. Department of Defense end users, technical data customarily provided to the public is

furnished in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7015. If a government agency needs additional rights, it must negotiate a

mutually acceptable written addendum to this Agreement specifically granting those rights.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY

7.1 Definition of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing

Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably

should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential

Information of Customer includes Customer Data; Confidential Information of SFDC includes the Services and Content, and

the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Order Forms (including pricing). Confidential Information of each party

includes business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business

processes disclosed by such party. However, Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) is or becomes

generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving

Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is

received from a third party without knowledge of any breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was

independently developed by the Receiving Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-disclosure obligations set forth in this

“Confidentiality” section apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the parties in connection with the evaluation of

additional SFDC services.



SFDC-MSA, October 16, 2023 Page 6 of 15

7.2 Protection of Confidential Information. As between the parties, each party retains all ownership rights in and to its

Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its

own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to (i) not use any Confidential Information of the

Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing

Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates’ employees

and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality

agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than

those herein. Neither party will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any Order Form to any third party other than its

Affiliates, legal counsel and accountants without the other party’s prior written consent, provided that a party that makes any

such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal counsel or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate’s, legal counsel’s or

accountant’s compliance with this “Confidentiality” section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SFDC may disclose the terms of

this Agreement and any applicable Order Form to a contractor or Non-SFDC Application Provider to the extent necessary to

perform SFDC’s obligations under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as set forth herein.

7.3 Compelled Disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent

compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to

the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest

the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of

a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the

Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that

Confidential Information.

8. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AND DISCLAIMERS

8.1 Representations. Each party represents that it has validly entered into this Agreement and has the legal power to do so.

8.2 SFDC Warranties. SFDC warrants that during an applicable subscription term (a) this Agreement, the Order Forms and the

Documentation will accurately describe the applicable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the

security, confidentiality and integrity of Customer Data, (b) SFDC will not materially decrease the overall security of the

Services, (c) the Services will perform materially in accordance with the applicable Documentation, and (d) subject to the

“Integration with Non-SFDC Applications” section above, SFDC will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the

Services. For any breach of a warranty above, Customer’s exclusive remedies are those described in the “Termination” and

“Refund or Payment upon Termination” sections below.

8.3 Disclaimers. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY

KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY

DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY

APPLICABLE LAW. SERVICES PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE, CONTENT AND BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED

“AS IS,” AND AS AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVE OF ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.

9. MUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Indemnification by SFDC. SFDC will defend Customer against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought

against Customer by a third party alleging that any Purchased Service infringes or misappropriates such third party’s intellectual

property rights (a “Claim Against Customer”), and will indemnify Customer from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally

awarded against Customer as a result of, or for amounts paid by Customer under a settlement approved by SFDC in writing of,

a Claim Against Customer, provided Customer (a) promptly gives SFDC written notice of the Claim Against Customer, (b)

gives SFDC sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against Customer (except that SFDC may not settle any

Claim Against Customer unless it unconditionally releases Customer of all liability), and (c) gives SFDC all reasonable

assistance, at SFDC’s expense. If SFDC receives information about an infringement or misappropriation claim related to a

Service, SFDC may in its discretion and at no cost to Customer (i) modify the Services so that they are no longer claimed to

infringe or misappropriate, without breaching SFDC’s warranties under “SFDC Warranties” above, (ii) obtain a license for

Customer’s continued use of that Service in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) terminate Customer’s subscriptions for that

Service upon 30 days’ written notice and refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of the

terminated subscriptions. The above defense and indemnification obligations do not apply if (I) the allegation does not state
