When This Privacy Policy Applies
--------------------------------

Our Policy applies to Online Services that we own or operate and that contain a link to this Privacy Policy. Our Policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone, via Online Services that do not link to this Privacy Policy, or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies.

Our Policy does not apply to the practices of other companies or other websites or software applications that may be linked from or made available through our Online Services.

The inclusion of a link on our Online Services or the ability to utilize a third-party website or software application through our Online Services does not imply that we endorse, or otherwise monitor the privacy or security practices of that third-party website or software application or the accuracy of its content, and your use of the third-party website or software application is governed by the third-party's privacy policy.

Some of our products and services are regulated by certain state and federal laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and may have specific privacy practices ("Product Privacy Notices") such as a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices or other specific privacy practices that we want you to be aware. This information can be found in the [Specific Product Privacy Notices](#specificnotices) section of this Privacy Policy. When a Product Privacy Notice exists, the content of the Product Privacy Notice applies to your use of the product and service.

This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.

What Information We Collect About You
-------------------------------------

We may collect two basic types of information through the Online Services: (1) information you provide directly to us, and (2) information that is automatically provided to us or collected through your use of our Online Services (collectively, “Information”).

Such Information may include information that identifies you such as your full name, telephone number, email address, postal address, certain account numbers, your User ID that you create or is assigned to you, health and medical information, including Protected Health Information, financial information and other information described in this Privacy Policy.

When you use the Online Services, you may provide certain Information directly to us. For example, you may input a telephone number or email address into a webform or enter information into a chat functionality.

For example, we may pre-populate certain demographic information in an online form or make health or medical information viewable on the Online Services that you have provided to us on paper forms or maintained in other information systems.

We also may obtain Information that is automatically collected through the Online Services. The automatically collected Information may include demographic, de-identified, aggregated, or certain information from your device such as technical information about your device, web-browser information, and server log files collected by us or provided by you. See [Cookies and Tracking](#cookiesandtracking) for more information on automatically collected information.

You may limit the Information you provide or make available to us if you want to; however, that may limit your ability to access or use certain functions of the Online Services or to request certain services or information.

#### Information that Identifies You

* Health, medical, therapy, or financial information;
* Information created by the Company;

You may withdraw consent to use precise, real-time, or network location data at any time by turning off the location-based feature on your mobile device or by not using any location-based features. If you withdraw your consent, functionality associated with precise, real-time, or network location (_e.g._, navigation) will no longer work.

We will only share your Information with third parties as outlined in this Policy and as otherwise permitted by law or as permitted with your consent.

We may also share Information with other third-party companies with which we have a business relationship or hire to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire a third-party company to help us send and manage email, and we might provide that third-party company with your email address and certain other Information for them to send you an email message on our behalf. Similarly, we may hire third-party companies to host or operate some of our Online Services and related computers and software applications.

[Back to top](https://www.uhc.com/privacy#Top)

How to Manage Your Information
------------------------------

Our Online Services may permit you to view your profile, if applicable, and access related Information about you and to request changes to such Information. Please remember, however, if we have already disclosed some of this Information to third parties, we may not have access to that disclosed information and may not be able to force the modification of any Information by the third parties to whom we have made those disclosures.

### Communication Preference Management

Our Online Services may permit you to select how you would like to receive certain communications. You can view and update your communication preferences in your Account/Profile settings after logging into the Online Services.

We may offer mobile applications that enable us to communicate with you through push notifications. Where mobile applications are offered, you may be able to manage push notifications in your mobile phone or tablet settings. You may also be able to control preview settings in your email applications.

If you need additional assistance in opting-out of a communication, please [Contact Us](#contactus) for assistance. Please be aware that opt-outs may not apply to certain types of communications, such as account status, Online Service updates, or other communications.

### Informational Calls and Texts

When you provide us a telephone number, whether landline or mobile, we may contact you, using automated, pre- recorded, or non-automated means, to provide you information about existing benefits, programs, products, services, or tools.

Personal Information collected through our texting programs will not be shared, sold, or disclosed to third parties for their own marketing purposes.

We reserve the right to modify this section at any time. The modified section will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued receipt of Informational Electronic Communications and Informational Calls and Texts will constitute your acceptance of the modified section.

### Cookies and Tracking

The Company may use various technologies, including cookies, tokens, tags, web logs, web beacons, scripts, and web server logs to gather automatically collected information and may aggregate this information from visitors of our Online Services or to enable certain features of our Online Services. This information may include demographic data, technical information about the technology (_e.g._, phone, computer) you use to connect to the Online Services, web browser information, your IP address, and browsing behavior such as pages visited and how often they are visited (collectively, "Activity Information"). We may also use third-party analytics companies to provide these services.

We may also allow third-parties to use cookies and other technologies to collect Activity Information and to track browsing activity over time and across third-party websites such as web browsers used to read our Online Services, which websites are referring traffic or linking to our Online Services, and to deliver targeted advertisements to you. We do not control these third-party technologies, and their use of such technologies is governed by their own privacy policies. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see [youradchoices.com/control,](https://youradchoices.com/control) and to opt-out of such ad networks' and services' advertising practices, go to [optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/) and [optout.networkadvertising.org/](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/). Once you click the links, you may choose to opt out of such advertising from all participating advertising companies or only from advertising provided by specific advertising companies. Please note that, to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Online Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

Activity Information is captured using various technologies and may include cookies. "Cookies" are small text files that may be placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit an Online Service or click on a URL using your web browser. Cookies may include "single-session cookies" which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and "persistent" cookies which are generally stored on a computer or mobile device unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire. You may disable cookies and similar items by adjusting your browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on our Online Services. In addition, you may also have additional means to manage the collection of Activity Information by:

* Managing the use of "flash" technologies, with the [Flash management tools](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html) available at Adobe's website;
* Clicking on the "Opt-Out" link at the bottom of the home webpage, if applicable;
* Visiting [Google](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) to "Opt-Out" of display advertising or customize Google display network ads;
* Clicking on the Optum Pixel "Opt-Out" [link](https://ometrics.optum.com/opt.htm); and
* Choosing the Glassbox "Opt-Out" [link](https://report.uhg.glassboxdigital.io/choose-not-to-be-recorded/)

Please note that we do not currently respond to web browser "Do Not Track" signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of Information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services because, among other reasons, there is no common definition of such signals and no industry-accepted standards for how such signals should be interpreted.

We gather Activity Information about you to improve the quality of our services, such as the best method and time to contact you. Without limiting the other ways in which we may use Information as described herein, we may otherwise use and disclose your Activity Information unless restricted by this Policy or by law. Some examples of the ways we use your Activity Information include:

* Customizing your experiences, including managing and recording your preferences;
* Authenticating your account information;
* Marketing, product development, and research purposes;
* Tracking resources and data accessed on the Online Services;
* Developing reports regarding Online Service usage, activity, and statistics;
* Assisting users experiencing problems with our services;
* Updating and servicing our Online Services;
* Enabling certain functions and tools on the Online Services; and
* Tracking paths of visitors to the Online Services and within the Online Services.

As described above, we may use tracking technologies that allow us to recognize your device when you return to our Online Services within a period of time, as determined by us, and to support automatic login to your Online Services. To maintain your privacy, you should affirmatively log out of your account prior to your session ending (whether you end your session or we end your session, for example if our Online Services has "timed out" - _i.e._, we have ended your session automatically after a period of inactivity as determined by us in our sole discretion). Unless you affirmatively log out of your account, you may be automatically logged back in the next time you or any user of your devices visits the Online Services.

### Retention of Data

We will retain your personally identifiable information (PII) and Activity Information for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your PII to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

### Posting Messages, Comments and Content

Our Online Services may have voluntary collaboration areas, including but not limited to "blogs," "bulletin boards," "leader boards," and "health games," that permit users to have collaborative discussions and/or share Information. Some of our Online Services may permit you to select a display name or image that will be your "nickname" on the Online Service. Please note, any Information you submit or post to these collaboration areas, including your display name or image, may be visible by other users of the Online Service, and such users may be able to identify you and make information public. Out of respect for the privacy of others, please avoid referring to the full names of others in your response and refrain from sharing other participants’ identities or comments outside of these discussions.

Also see our [Social Media Disclaimer](#socialmedia) to learn about our practices related to posting on our social media accounts.

Protecting Your Information
---------------------------

We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the Information that you provide on our Online Services. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the Information that is being collected, used, and stored. We cannot guarantee the security of our Online Services, nor can we guarantee the security of the Information you transmit to us over the Internet, including your use of email. We are not liable for the illegal acts of third parties such as criminal hackers.

It is your responsibility to safeguard the devices you use to access our Online Services (such as laptops, tablets and mobile devices), and to use appropriate security settings on those devices. If those devices are lost, stolen or misplaced, others may be able to access your account and your personal Information using those devices. You should affirmatively log out of your account (i) prior to ending your session, or (ii) if you will be inactive on the Online Services for more than a few minutes; otherwise, the next user of that computer or device, particularly a public one or one not owned by you, may be able to access your account and the Information in your account if your session has not ended.

You agree that we are not responsible for any harm that may result from someone accessing your account or personal Information on any computer or device where you do not, for any reason, take the necessary steps to log out of your account prior to ending a session on such device or computer.

We retain Information for as long as necessary for the purpose for which it is collected, subject to a longer period if the Information is relevant to a legal challenge.
