We collect Personal Information that you provide directly to us. Personal Information is required to use certain Sites features, for example, to purchase products, sign up for our newsletters, contact us via email or telephone, to create online accounts, send us questions through forms on our Sites, submit job application materials, inquire about missing puzzle pieces, and respond to communications from us (e.g., promotional offers). 

**Accounts.**  

When you create an account through our Sites, we collect your contact information (e.g. name, address, phone number, email address).  You are also required to choose a password which you should keep confidential.

Purchasing E-Gift Cards. We may receive your contact information (e.g. name, address, phone number, email address) when you purchase a Buffalo Games gift card.  If you purchase a gift card, you are purchasing through BigCommerce whose privacy policy can be found [here.](https://www.bigcommerce.com/privacy/)

Your submission of an application or inquiry does not in any way require Buffalo Games to review your information or consider you for employment.

We may use your email and mailing address to send you promotional and other electronic and hardcopy communications. We may use third-parties or service providers, such as Mailchimp to deliver these communications to you. You may opt-out of such emails by using the unsubscribe link in the email. To opt-out of other communications (e.g., postal marketing and telemarketing), please contact us as set forth in the "Contact Us" section below. Opting out of marketing communications does not opt you out of other, non-marketing communications from us.

**SOURCE 2: We Collect Personal Information Automatically.**

We collect information automatically from you when you visit the Sites.

**Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies.** 

_What types of online tracking mechanisms do we use?_ We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and other tracking technologies (collectively “Cookies”) on our Sites.  

_What are cookies and web beacons / pixel tags?_ A cookie is a small text file that our Sites save onto your computer or device when you use the Sites that provides us certain information about your activities.  Cookies allow the Sites to remember your actions and preferences and recognize you or your browser, along with some information you provided.  Web beacons / pixel tags are small graphics on a webpage that monitor your activity when viewing a webpage.

_Why do we collect Cookies?  We use Cookies to:_

\- make our Sites function properly;  
\- provide personalized experiences;  
\- tailor our interactions with you;  
\- help with our marketing efforts;  
\- provide us with valuable data and statistics about the usage and effectiveness of our Sites and to help us improve our Sites;  
help us improve our services;  
\- may help with customer log-in credentials;  
\- help provide online shopping carts; and  
\- provide wish lists and product recommendations.  
 

_What type of information do Cookies collect?  The Cookies on our Sites may collect information such as:_

\- IP addresses assigned to the computers and other devices you use;  
\- your internet service provider;  
\- device ID number;  
\- approximate geographic location (e.g., zip code);  
\- browser type;  
\- Sites pages visited;  
\- websites you access before and after visiting the Sites; and   
\- data related to how and when you use the Sites.  
 

We may combine information from Cookies with other Personal Information.

_How long do Cookies last?_ A Cookie can either be a “session” Cookie or a “persistent” Cookie. Session Cookies exist only for so long as you are visiting the applicable Sites and are typically deleted when you exit your web browser.  Persistent Cookies exist for a set period of time, for example, up to several months or years.  Each time you visit Sites that have implemented a persistent Cookie, the persistent Cookie is renewed and that Cookie will remain active until its predetermined expiration date.  You can manually delete persistent Cookies through your browser settings.

_First and Third-party Cookies._  Cookies may either be “first-party” or “third-party” Cookies.  A first-party Cookie allows your web browser to talk to the actual Sites that you are visiting (i.e. the Sites).  A third-party Cookie allows your web browser to talk to a third-party website, such as the source of an ad that appears on the website you are visiting or a third-party analytics provider.  We may not have control over how a third-party uses information collected through third-party Cookies.  

_How do you manage Cookies or opt-out?_  Most browsers automatically accept cookies.  You can disable this function by changing your browser settings, but disabling cookies may impact your use and enjoyment of the Sites.  Not all features or functions of the Sites may work properly if you disable Cookies.  You cannot disable all Cookies, such as Cookies that are essential to the functioning of the Sites.

Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to collect and process information about your use of the Sites.  Google sets cookies on your browser or device, and then your web browser will automatically send information to Google.  Google uses this information to provide us with reports that we use to better understand and measure how users interact with our Sites. We may also implement additional add-on services to Google Analytics, such as Demographics and Interest Reporting, Remarketing with Google Analytics, and Google Display Network Impression Reporting.

To learn more about how Google uses data, visit [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and Google’s page on [“How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps.”](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) You may download the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) for each web browser you use, but this does not prevent the use of other analytics tools.  To learn more about Google Analytics cookies, visit [Google Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites.](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage)

**Online Behavioral Advertising.** Advertising network services gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables the delivery of advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests.  This practice is often referred to as “targeted advertising.”

We use advertising network services that collect data about your visits to the Sites and other websites across the internet.  These advertising network services use such data to target personal content and advertisements to you about our products.  The data collected may be associated with your personal information.  The targeted advertisements may appear on the Sites and on other websites and may be sent to you via email.  

For example, we may use Google Ads and Facebook Custom Audience to serve ads on our behalf across the internet and on the Sites.  Google Ads and Facebook Custom Audience use cookies, web beacons and other storage technologies to collect data about your visits to the Sites and your interaction with our products and services to provide us measurements and generate targeted advertisements to you on other websites that you visit across the internet.  To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google, to customize your ad preferences, or to limit Google’s collection or use of such data, visit Google’s Safety Center and [Google’s Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated) and follow [Google’s personalized ad opt-out instructions](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en&ref_topic=7048998).  Opting out will not affect your use of the Sites.  To opt of remarketing advertising provided through Facebook, you can use the following mechanism for exercising such a choice at https://youradchoices.com/control.

**Videos; Embedded Content.**  The Sites may contain videos and embedded content provided by YouTube, Vimeo and other third parties, including visible content and/or feeds scripts embedded in the Site's code. YouTube, Vimeo and such third parties may collect data about how you interact with such content.  Specifically, our use of YouTube content requires us to implement certain application programming interfaces (APIs) from YouTube, which allow for data collection, disclosure and use by YouTube pursuant to the Google Privacy Policy available [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy).  In addition, if you are signed into your Vimeo account when you visit our Sites, Vimeo may associate information collected when you visit our Sites with your account.  By watching the videos and interacting with such content, you agree to the collection and use of such data.  You may revoke YouTube’s access to your data by visiting the Google security settings page available [here](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?pli=1).  Please see [Vimeo's privacy policy](https://vimeo.com/privacy) to learn how Vimeo collects, uses and shares Personal Information.

_Who May Exercise Your Rights._  If you are a California resident, only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a request related to your Personal Information.  See the section titled "Using an Authorized Agent" for more information.  A parent or legal guardian may make a request on behalf of their child. 

_Verifiable Consumer Request._  In order to verify your request, you must provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information, and you must describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to your request.

When we receive your request to exercise your rights under the CCPA: (a) we will acknowledge receipt of your request; (b) we will try to match the information you provide in making the request with information we already maintain about you; (c) if required to verify your identity, we may ask you to provide additional information, including Personal Information; and (d) we will consider various factors when determining how to verify your identity, such as the sensitivity and value of the data, the risk of harm, the likelihood of fraud, etc.

We will only use Personal Information we collect during the verification process for the purpose of verifying your identity.  If you maintain an account with us, we may use that account to respond to your request and/or verify your identity.  If we are unable to verify your identity as required by applicable laws and regulations, we will decline to comply with your request, and let you know why.   

_When We Will Respond._  We will try to respond to your request within 45 days. If we require additional time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information to you. We may charge a fee to process or respond to your request if it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.

**Using an Authorized Agent.**  You have a right to submit requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA through an authorized agent. An authorized agent must be registered with the Secretary of State in California to conduct business in California.  If you choose to use an authorized agent, you must (a) provide signed, written permission to that authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf, (b) verify your identity directly with Buffalo Games, and (c) directly confirm with Buffalo Games that you granted permission to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf.  For clarity, you are required to verify the identity of both yourself and the authorized agent.

We may deny a request from an authorized agent if we do not have proof that they are authorized by you to act on your behalf.

**Non-Discrimination.** You have a right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA. If we choose to offer a financial incentives program in the future, additional terms will apply which may be an exception to this Section.

**California’s “Do-Not-Track” Requirement.  we currently do not honor “do not track” requests.**  

**Shine the Light.**  Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you are a California resident, you have the right to obtain: (a) a list of all third parties to whom we may have disclosed your Personal Information within the past year for direct marketing purposes, and (b) a description of the categories of Personal Information disclosed, by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://buffalogames.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
