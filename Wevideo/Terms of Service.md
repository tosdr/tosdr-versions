**5\. TERM AND TERMINATION**.

**a.     Term; Renewal**.  This WeVideo Services Agreement’s initial term starts on the effective date and continues until the term in the last Quote ends.

**b.     Termination for Breach**. Either Party may terminate this WeVideo Services Agreement or any Quote if the other Party materially breaches this WeVideo Services Agreement or such Quote and fails to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days (or ten (10) days if such breach is a breach by Customer of any payment obligation) after written notice of such breach.  
**c.     Immediate Termination**. Either Party may terminate this WeVideo Services Agreement and any or all Quotes immediately upon notice to the other Party if the other Party (i) is adjudged insolvent or bankrupt, (ii) institutes or has instituted against it any proceeding seeking relief, reorganization or arrangement under any laws relating to insolvency (and, in the case of any such proceeding instituted against it, the proceeding is not dismissed within thirty (30) days after the filing), (iii) makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, (iv) appoints a receiver, liquidator or trustee of any of its property assets, or (v) liquidates, dissolves or winds up its business.

**e.     Suspension**. WeVideo may suspend or interrupt the provision of Services, in whole or in part, at any time immediately upon notice to Customer if WeVideo determines that: (i) Customer or Users are using or intend to use the Services in violation of this Agreement or in violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (ii) any computer system of Customer has been compromised or unlawfully accessed; (iii) suspension of the Services is necessary to protect the infrastructure of WeVideo or its Affiliates, the environment in which the SaaS Solution is deployed, or WeVideo’s other customers; (iv) suspension is required under law, rule or regulation; or (v) Customer has failed to pay Fees when due. All remedies in this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, other remedies available to WeVideo.  

**6\. CONFIDENTIALITY**. “Confidential Information” means the nonpublic or proprietary business, technical or financial information disclosed or made available to one Party (“Recipient”) by or on behalf of the other Party (“Discloser”) pursuant to this Agreement and includes all information marked by Discloser as confidential or proprietary and any other information, whether written or oral and whether disclosed or made available before or during the term of this Agreement, that Recipient should reasonably understand is confidential or proprietary to Discloser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6, Confidential Information shall not include information which: (i) was already known to Recipient at the time of disclosure by Discloser, and Recipient was under no obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information; (ii) is disclosed to Recipient by a third party who had the right to make such disclosure without any confidentiality restrictions; (iii) is, or through no fault of Recipient has become, generally available to the public; (iv) is independently developed by Recipient without access to, reference or use of, Discloser’s Confidential Information; or (v) Customer Data. WeVideo’s obligations with respect to Customer Data are set forth in Section 7 and other sections of this Agreement. The recipient will not disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to any third party, except as permitted in this Section 6. Recipient will protect and keep confidential Discloser’s Confidential Information using the same degree of care that the Recipient uses to protect its own nonpublic or proprietary business, technical or financial information of similar importance, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will not use Discloser’s Confidential Information for any purpose other than to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement or as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement. The disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement is not intended in any way to transfer or grant any right, title or interest in or to such Confidential Information to Recipient unless otherwise expressly indicated in this Agreement or by Discloser in writing. Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information of Discloser only to those of its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and contractors (“Representatives”) who have a legitimate need to know such Confidential Information consistent with the purposes of this Agreement and who have agreed, either as a condition of employment, representation or in a written agreement, to be bound by terms and conditions substantially as protective as the confidentiality terms and conditions applicable to Recipient under this Section 6. Recipient shall be responsible and liable for any breach by its Representatives of the obligations of Recipient set forth in this Section 6. 

**7\. DATA SECURITY**. WeVideo shall maintain commercially reasonable security precautions, consistent with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, SOC 2 Type II, and generally accepted industry standards, designed to protect the security of Customer Data in WeVideo’s possession or control. WeVideo shall process Customer Data in accordance with the Privacy Policy. By using the Services, Customer consents to the transfer, processing, and storage of Customer Data in accordance with this Agreement, the Privacy Policy and the DPA. The Data Processing Addendum available at https://www.wevideo.com/dpa (“DPA”) is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement.  

**8\. WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**.

**a.     WeVideo Warranty**. WeVideo represents and warrants that: (i) the SaaS Solution will materially conform to the technical documentation provided to Customer by WeVideo, and (ii) the Professional Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner.  
**b.     Third-Party Materials**. The SaaS Solution may include or provide access to third-party services, links to third-party websites or resources, and media files and other content that may be protected by terms and conditions of such third-parties or intellectual property rights of such third parties (“Third-Party Materials”). WeVideo does not evaluate, and is not responsible for, the content of any such Third-Party Materials, acts or omissions of third party’s or its use of Customer Data. Customer is expressly prohibited from copying, uploading, downloading, or sharing Third-Party Materials unless Customer has the right to do so. Customer, not WeVideo, will be fully responsible and liable for what Customer copies, shares, uploads, downloads or otherwise uses while using the SaaS Solution. Customer’s use of any such Third-Party Materials is governed by the applicable terms of use and privacy policy of such Third-Party Materials, and not by this Agreement.  
**c.     Disclaimer of Warranties**. THE SAAS SOLUTION AND ALL SERVICES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL AI ASSIST AND ALL WEVIDEO CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WEVIDEO MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ELSEWHERE, ALL THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF OR CONCERNING ANY THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS (IF ANY) IS STRICTLY BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND THE THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER, OWNER OR DISTRIBUTOR OF THE THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS. WEVIDEO HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT IT HAS NOT RELIED AND IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR OTHER STATEMENTS WHATSOEVER, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL (FROM OR BY WEVIDEO OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES) OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT IT WILL NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY RISING OUT OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR OTHER STATEMENT NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.  
**d.     Consequential Damages Disclaimer**. SUBJECT TO SECTION 8(F), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR COSTS (INCLUDING LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES) IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUPPLY, USE OR PERFORMANCE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BREACH OR FAILURE OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, MISREPRESENTATION, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR COSTS.  
**e.     Liability Cap**. SUBJECT TO SECTION 8(F), THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY AND ITS AFFILIATES FOR ALL DAMAGES AND LIABILITIES ARISING UNDER ALL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE PRIVACY POLICY AND DPA), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION (INCLUDING ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, RESCISSION, MISREPRESENTATION AND BREACH OF WARRANTY) SHALL NOT, IN THE AGGREGATE, EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO WEVIDEO UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT WHICH CAUSED THE DAMAGE RELATING TO THE FIRST CLAIM MADE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8 SHALL APPLY EVEN IF AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT HAS FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  
**f.     Exceptions**. The provisions of Section 8(d) and Section 8(e) shall not apply to damages and liabilities that arise from: (i) Customer’s breach of Section 1; (ii) Customer’s breach of Section 4; (iii) a Party’s infringement upon the other Party’s intellectual property rights; (iv) a Party’s breach of Section 6; or (v) a Party’s obligations under Section 9 or breach thereof.

**9\. INDEMNIFICATION**.

**a.     Customer Obligation**. Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless, and hereby releases, WeVideo, its Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, investigations, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) that arise from, relate to, are based upon or allege: (i) Customer’s actual or alleged breach of any obligation, representation or warranty in this Agreement; (ii) the content of any Customer Data; (iii) the use, modification, display or distribution of Customer Data by WeVideo or any of its Affiliates as authorized or contemplated under this Agreement; or (iii) Customer’s actual or alleged violation of Law, willful misconduct or fraud. Customer shall control the defense of any indemnified claim, including appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof; provided, however, Customer may not enter into any settlement under which WeVideo or any of its Affiliates is required to admit fault or liability or comply with any ongoing obligation.  
**b.     WeVideo’s Obligation**. WeVideo shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer from and against any and all third-party claims, and any and all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred by Customer as a direct result of such third-party claims, to the extent such third-party claims arise from an allegation that the SaaS Solution, as provided by WeVideo, infringes such third party’s US intellectual property rights.  If an action or claim is brought that is subject to indemnification under this Section 9(b), or if WeVideo reasonably determines in its discretion that such an action or claim is likely to be made, WeVideo may, at its option, (i) replace or modify the SaaS Solution so it is no longer infringing, or (ii) obtain for Customer the right to continue using the SaaS Solution. If WeVideo determines that neither (i) nor (ii) is commercially practicable, then WeVideo may terminate Customer's right to use the infringing SaaS Solution, in which event Customer shall receive, as its sole and exclusive remedy, a pro-rata refund of amounts paid for the SaaS Solution based upon the remaining term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, WeVideo will have no obligations under this Section 9 in connection with any claims, actions, damages and liabilities that arise from or relate to: (a) breach of this Agreement by Customer or any Users, (b) negligence or more culpable conduct by Customer or any Users, (c) violation of any laws by Customer or any Users, (d) the combination of the SaaS Solution with any software, hardware, data or technology that is not provided by WeVideo or not proprietary to WeVideo, (e) any claim, action, cause of action, suit, proceeding or investigation subject to indemnification under Section 9(a), or (f) Third-Party Materials or any output of AI Assist. Customer shall provide prompt notice of any indemnified claim and reasonably cooperate with WeVideo’s defense. WeVideo will control the defense of any indemnified claim, including appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof. WeVideo’s obligation in this Section 9 will be excused if either of the following materially prejudices the defense: (1) Customer failure to provide prompt notice of the indemnified claim; or (2) Customer’s failure to cooperate in the defense. The remedies set forth in this Section 9(b) are Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and WeVideo’s sole and exclusive liability, in connection with any and all claims subject to indemnification under this Section 9(b).

**10\. STRUCTURE OF AGREEMENT**. Each Quote shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all of the terms and conditions of this WeVideo Services Agreement and shall constitute a separate and binding Agreement between WeVideo or its Affiliate that is the signatory to the Quote and Customer or its Affiliate that is the signatory to the Quote.  Each of WeVideo and Customer is responsible for any breach of this WeVideo Services Agreement or any Quote by its Affiliates that are signatories to any Quote. An Affiliate of either Party may contract under this WeVideo Services Agreement by executing a Quote. Each Affiliate executing a Quote is agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this WeVideo Services Agreement. In such case, a WeVideo Affiliate shall be deemed to be “WeVideo” and a “Party” for purposes of this Agreement; and a Customer Affiliate shall be deemed to be “Customer” and a “Party” for purposes of this Agreement. In the event there are any conflicts or any inconsistencies between the terms and conditions of any Quote and the terms and conditions of this WeVideo Services Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Quote shall govern for such Quote. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the DPA, on one hand, and this Agreement or the Privacy Policy on the other hand, this Agreement and the Privacy Policy shall govern.

**11\. MISCELLANEOUS**. This Agreement, and any applicable Quote under this Agreement: (i) is governed by, and will be interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the State of Delaware’s conflict of laws rules; (ii) is binding upon, and will inure to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; and (iii) constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral negotiations, understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, with respect to the subject matter herein. All waivers must be in writing. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by duly authorized representatives of each Party. Customer may not, directly or indirectly, assign, transfer, or delegate any of or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of WeVideo. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 11 shall be null and void. Each Party expressly consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal, state and local courts in Wilmington, Delaware to govern all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek injunctive relief against the other Party from any other judicial or administrative authority pending the resolution of such dispute. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining portions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. If any legal action is brought to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to receive its attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other collection expenses. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. All references to and mentions of the words “including,” “include” or “includes” shall be deemed to be followed by “without limitation.” “Or” is not exclusive. The following Sections shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement (where reference is to a Section, all subsections are deemed to be included): 1(d), 1(e), 3, 4, 5(d), 6, 8(c), 8(d), 8(e), 8(f), 9, 10, 11, and any other provisions which by their nature should survive such termination or expiration. WeVideo shall not be liable for failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement if such failure is a result of any event outside of the reasonable control of WeVideo.
