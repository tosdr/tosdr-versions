Article 2 - Description of FAMILEO Services



FAMILEO Services are services that allow access to the following main features by subscribing to a

paid subscription:

- Creation of a private family group network – at the end of the registration process, a family

group code is generated and sent to the Subscriber. This code allows other family group members -

up to 60 accounts - to join the family group network free of charge and to send messages to the Loved-

one;

- Access to sending messages consisting of texts and/or photos to the Loved one from the

Site or Application. The number of messages sent to the Loved-one will be limited according to the

chosen plan. Once this limit is reached, it will no longer be possible for the Subscriber and other family

group members to post new messages until the next edition of the gazette;

- Access to the digital gazettes and photo gallery from the Site or Application;

- Layout, printing and shipping a paper gazette to the Loved-one.



For FAMILEO subscribers to "Monthly" and “Monthly+” subscription plans, these publications will take

place every four weeks. For FAMILEO subscribers to a "Bi-Monthly" subscription plan these

publications take place every two weeks. For FAMILEO Service subscribers to a "Weekly” plan these

publications take place every week.



Once the subscription expires or is terminated for any reason, the User expressly acknowledges that

access to certain features of the FAMILEO Services will be no longer permitted:

- The generation of paper gazettes and shipping to the Loved-one is discontinued

- The digital gazettes are no longer generated

- Push messages are no longer sent



Other features may be maintained for a limited time from the date of termination of the subscription

(including the possibility to view messages in particular).

Internet browsing software, by connecting to the Site, or from a mobile phone and/or compatible tablet

after downloading and installing the Application.

mobile data provider so that they have access to use FAMILEO Services.

to the Internet as specified in Article 11 Liability, below.



Article 4 - Availability of FAMILEO Services

FAMILEO Services without notice or any right to compensation, doing so for the following reasons:

- For realization of any necessary modifications and improvements to FAMILEO Services and

in particular those related to technical evolution. ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS undertakes that

this will not result in a price increase, loss of quality or substantial modification of the

functionalities of the FAMILEO Services in question.

- To ensure realization of maintenance operations.

The User releases ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS from any liability in this respect and waives all claims

and/or proceedings against him as a result.

5.1 Right to unsubscribe

In accordance with Article L. 221-18 of the Consumer Code, the Subscriber is informed that he or she

of the withdrawal period, in accordance with Article L. 221-25 of the Consumer Code.



If the Subscriber does not wish to have immediate access to the Services, he or she may quit the Site

or the Application after validation of his or her payment and wait until the fourteen-day period has

expired.

Nevertheless, if a User connects to the Subscriber's account and uses the Services before this period

has expired, this first connection from the subscription is an express request from the Subscriber to

have immediate access to the Services.



Immediate access to the Services does not deprive the Subscriber of his or her right of withdrawal,

which still runs until the end of the fourteen-day period. However, immediate access to the Services

implies that the Subscriber is responsible for payment of an amount proportional to his or her use of

the Services.

In the event of exercising the right of withdrawal, ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS will then reimburse the

Subscriber the amount of the subscription fee minus the amount corresponding to the number of days

elapsed between the day of the first use of the Services and that of reception by ENTOURAGE

SOLUTIONS of the request for retraction, being specified that any day on which a service is started is

due.

7

payment as that used by the Subscriber for the initial transaction, unless otherwise instructed by the

latter.

Annex 2: Terms \& Conditions of the FAMILEO Kitty

ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS offers its Subscribers and its Users, as defined hereafter, for using the kitty

as a method of payment.



Article 1: Definitions

• Subscriber – refers to the ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS customer, who is responsible for the primary

payment method and has the right to administer the family group account. This person can either have

subscribed directly to the FAMILEO Services, or have taken the function of an account manager following

a subscription transfer.

• User – means any natural person who uses FAMILEO Services and is not a Subscriber.



Article 2: Using the FAMILEO kitty

The aim of the FAMILEO kitty is to facilitate various financial contributions to the FAMILEO subscription

between all the Users in the same family group and the Subscriber.



In fact, each account created automatically generates a kitty accessible online by each User and the

Subscriber.



Each User has the option to deposit an amount of his or her choice in the kitty. This is subject to being

within the limit of the maximum kitty amount, as mentioned in Article 3 below.

The sums are kept in a secure account.



Article 3: Maximum amount of the FAMILEO kitty

The maximum amount for each kitty is the equivalent to one year’s subscription (12 full months).



Thus the maximum kitty amount may vary depending on the chosen FAMILEO Services subscription.

For example:

- In the case of a subscription to €5.99 VAT/month, the maximum kitty amount will be €71.88 VAT

- In the case of a subscription of €9.99 VAT/month, the maximum kitty amount will be €119.88 VAT

23



When the maximum kitty amount is reached, Users can no longer add contributions, and a digital

message confirms this block.



The User and the Subscriber have the possibility to check the amount in the kitty at any time through the

Site or the App.



Article 4: Using the FAMILEO kitty

The sums deposited on the kitty are used by priority to pay the current subscription fees.

Thus, the subscriber's payment method will be paused until the balance of the kitty is insufficient for

paying the coming month’s subscription.



When the amount in the kitty has become insufficient for payment of the coming month’s subscription,

the Subscriber’s means of payment (e.g. debit card) will be debited for the corresponding sum.



Article 5: Termination of the FAMILEO subscription and refund of the kitty

5.1 In the event of termination of a subscription to FAMILEO Services and if there is still

customer support to ask for a refund of the credit in the kitty, customer support will send them an email,

informing them that there is still credit in the kitty and asking them if they would like to receive the

24



remaining credit as a refund or donate it to the FAMILEO Foundation.

its staff the "family codes" communicated to him by the Company. In the event of termination of the

Company may, without delay, deactivate the "family codes” it has provided, without the User having

any right to claim any rights or compensation in this respect from the Company.
