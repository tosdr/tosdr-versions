FAMILEO Services offer their users the opportunity of setting up a family group network to send

messages to a close friend who is unfamiliar with new technologies (hereinafter referred to as "the

Loved-one"). These messages are formatted as a gazette, which is then sent to the Loved-one. The

establishment of the family group network requires one of the family group members (hereinafter

referred to as "the Subscriber") being subscribed to one of the FAMILEO Services.



This allows certain users, namely other members of the family group and the Loved-one, access to the

3



FAMILEO Services free of charge, as long as the Subscriber has subscribed correctly, and the

subscription is still valid.



These Terms \& Conditions of sale and use (hereinafter referred to as "the Terms \& Conditions")

exclusively govern FAMILEO Services provided by ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS as part of one of the

following subscription plans taken up by a private person: "Monthly", “Monthly+”, "Bi-Monthly" and

"Weekly". In the case of a subscription taken up by a professional establishment for its residents and/or

users, another set of Terms \& Conditions of sale and use apply.



These Terms \& Conditions apply to the exclusion of all others, and in particular to the exclusion of

those in effect for other services - free and/or paid - offered by ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS.



The purpose of these Terms \& Conditions is to set the conditions for subscribing to FAMILEO Services

as well as the conditions for accessing and using the FAMILEO Services accessible on the Site and

through the Application.

They govern the contractual relations between ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS as one party and each

Subscriber, their Loved-one and family group member(s) (hereinafter referred to together as "the

Users") collectively as the other party, under the specific condition that access to the Services by the

Loved-one or a family group member depends on the validity of the Subscriber's account.



Subscription to the FAMILEO Services by Subscribers and access to and use of the FAMILEO

Services is strictly subject to prior unrestricted and unreserved acceptance of these Terms \&

Conditions.



If a User does not wish to be bound by these Terms \& Conditions, he or she is respectfully invited to

Article 2 - Description of FAMILEO Services



FAMILEO Services are services that allow access to the following main features by subscribing to a

paid subscription:

- Creation of a private family group network – at the end of the registration process, a family

group code is generated and sent to the Subscriber. This code allows other family group members -

4



up to 60 accounts - to join the family group network free of charge and to send messages to the Loved-

one;

- Access to sending messages consisting of texts and/or photos to the Loved one from the

Site or Application. The number of messages sent to the Loved-one will be limited according to the

chosen plan. Once this limit is reached, it will no longer be possible for the Subscriber and other family

group members to post new messages until the next edition of the gazette;

- Access to the digital gazettes and photo gallery from the Site or Application;

- Layout, printing and shipping a paper gazette to the Loved-one.



For FAMILEO subscribers to "Monthly" and “Monthly+” subscription plans, these publications will take

place every four weeks. For FAMILEO subscribers to a "Bi-Monthly" subscription plan these

publications take place every two weeks. For FAMILEO Service subscribers to a "Weekly” plan these

publications take place every week.



Once the subscription expires or is terminated for any reason, the User expressly acknowledges that

access to certain features of the FAMILEO Services will be no longer permitted:

- The generation of paper gazettes and shipping to the Loved-one is discontinued

- The digital gazettes are no longer generated

- Push messages are no longer sent



Other features may be maintained for a limited time from the date of termination of the subscription

after downloading and installing the Application.



Access to FAMILEO Services requires an internet connection and, if applicable, a mobile data

5

recommended.

All costs relating to hardware, software and Internet subscriptions required to access the Services

to the Internet as specified in Article 11 Liability, below.



Article 4 - Availability of FAMILEO Services

- For realization of any necessary modifications and improvements to FAMILEO Services and

in particular those related to technical evolution. ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS undertakes that

this will not result in a price increase, loss of quality or substantial modification of the

functionalities of the FAMILEO Services in question.

and/or proceedings against him as a result.

hours before they occur, except where such interruptions are of an emergency nature and do not allow

Article 5 - Right of withdrawal - Duration - Renewal - Termination

5.1 Right to unsubscribe

In accordance with Article L. 221-18 of the Consumer Code, the Subscriber is informed that he or she

of the withdrawal period, in accordance with Article L. 221-25 of the Consumer Code.



If the Subscriber does not wish to have immediate access to the Services, he or she may quit the Site

or the Application after validation of his or her payment and wait until the fourteen-day period has

expired.

Nevertheless, if a User connects to the Subscriber's account and uses the Services before this period

has expired, this first connection from the subscription is an express request from the Subscriber to

have immediate access to the Services.



Immediate access to the Services does not deprive the Subscriber of his or her right of withdrawal,

which still runs until the end of the fourteen-day period. However, immediate access to the Services

implies that the Subscriber is responsible for payment of an amount proportional to his or her use of

the Services.

In the event of exercising the right of withdrawal, ENTOURAGE SOLUTIONS will then reimburse the

Subscriber the amount of the subscription fee minus the amount corresponding to the number of days

elapsed between the day of the first use of the Services and that of reception by ENTOURAGE

SOLUTIONS of the request for retraction, being specified that any day on which a service is started is

due.

SOLUTIONS was informed of the Subscriber's decision to retract, and through the same means of

payment as that used by the Subscriber for the initial transaction, unless otherwise instructed by the

latter.

be fully applicable to the Subscriber, provided that the new rate has been sent to the Subscriber under

the conditions set out on Article 8 Fees below.

the end date and time indicated on the Subscriber's account for a trial or discovery offer, unless

Thus the maximum kitty amount may vary depending on the chosen FAMILEO Services subscription.

For example:

- In the case of a subscription to €5.99 VAT/month, the maximum kitty amount will be €71.88 VAT

- In the case of a subscription of €9.99 VAT/month, the maximum kitty amount will be €119.88 VAT

22



When the maximum kitty amount is reached, Users can no longer add contributions, and a digital

message confirms this block.



The User and the Subscriber have the possibility to check the amount in the kitty at any time through the

Site or the App.



Article 4: Using the FAMILEO kitty

The sums deposited on the kitty are used by priority to pay the current subscription fees.

Thus, the subscriber's payment method will be paused until the balance of the kitty is insufficient for

paying the coming month’s subscription.



When the amount in the kitty has become insufficient for payment of the coming month’s subscription,

the Subscriber’s means of payment (e.g. debit card) will be debited for the corresponding sum.



Article 5: Termination of the FAMILEO subscription and refund of the kitty

5.1 In the event of termination of a subscription to FAMILEO Services and if there is still

shall be made by bank transfer within a maximum of one week.



5.3 Conditions for donating the remaining amount to the FAMILEO Foundation.

customer support to ask for a refund of the credit in the kitty, customer support will send them an email,

informing them that there is still credit in the kitty and asking them if they would like to receive the

23



remaining credit as a refund or donate it to the FAMILEO Foundation.
