The purpose of this document  
  
This privacy notice is written to help individuals understand how Tranquiliti collects and processes personal data, and what rights our data subjects have over what happens to their data, what data we process and how we collect it.  
‍  
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data is “any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)”. The data we collect can be put into the following areas:  
  
**Wellbeing data - obtained from students through our web and mobile app**  
Processing students’ wellbeing data is integral to the delivery of Tranquiliti, and the support we provide to schools and students through our app and dashboard.  
  
**Login data - obtained from students and staff when signing up**  
We process student and staff data around their personal characteristics in order so that we can build a secure login process for all of our users.  
  
**Usage data - obtained when students and staff use Tranquiliti**  
We process anonymised data around how students and staff use our app and dashboard so that we can make improvements to the service and increase our overall impact.  
  
**School data - obtained directly from schools on their students and staff**  
We process school data in order to create a seamless and secure implementation and sign-up process for students and staff, and to help schools better understand their students.  
  
**Marketing data - obtained from our website, other public sources of information, and direct communication**  
We process data on the individuals who are likely to be interested in either purchasing Tranquiliti, or working with us in its development and growth. We also use cookies when people visit our website to help improve their experience, and to make sure we can effectively communicate with them.  
  
  
Why do we process this personal data  
  
We process personal data in order to sell our service to schools, and in order so that school staff and students can securely access our digital products, with the overall aim of supporting the wellbeing and education of young people.  
  
  
What we do with the data  
‍  
We use data for multiple purposes, all of which contribute to the aim of supporting the wellbeing and education of young people, these include:● Providing school students with personalised support for their wellbeing  
● Providing school staff with insights into the wellbeing of students  
● Ensuring the smooth running of the service, and the sharing of data with the right individuals  
● Identifying how to make improvements to the service based on current usage  
● Identifying and communicating with individuals who may want to use or work with Tranquiliti  
  
  
Who we share data with  
  
We share students’ wellbeing data with their schools so that they can proactively support their students. We also share anonymised data with trusted organisations, including charities and universities, who can advance their research using the information.  
  
The only other circumstance in which we will share personal information is when there is a legal requirement to do so.  
  
  
How we store your information, and when we delete it  
  
All the data we collect is securely stored within Amazon Web Services.  
  
We store data until it is no longer useful in providing our service. We delete data on our users either when they move on from the relevant school, or when Tranquiliti’s contract with that school ends. We will continue to process anonymised data on users after this point, so that we can continue to carry out analytics on the data to support the improvement of the service.
