Simple speak introduction for Terms of Service
==============================================

You’re busy. We get it. So we’ve summed up our Terms of Service in a few simple sentences. They don’t replace the official legal stuff, but they will give you an idea of what’s in there. Any questions or concerns – please contact us.

Here are the headlines (imagine them with a clock bonging in the background if you like):

* You have to be 16 years or older to use our tools.
    
* Your content is yours – you own it, and you are responsible for it. We’ll only do what’s needed for our services to work properly...
    
* ...unless you are doing something illegal, in which case we can block and/or delete your stuff, and suspend your accounts.
    
* We may make changes to our terms, service and/or fees from time to time. If you have an account and don’t like something we change, you can always cancel at any time.
    
* And we should mention that you use our service at your own risk; we are not liable for any damages if things go wrong.
    

And that’s it. Seems fair right? You do you, we’ll do us and everything will be fine.

6. WeTransfer Paid Transfer

    2. WeTransfer Paid Transfer allows Uploaders to distribute their Content to others and collect payment for it.
        
    3. WeTransfer does not offer a marketplace for the sale of Content and is not responsible for the distribution of a link transfer whether via WeTransfer’s own services or otherwise. WeTransfer Paid Transfer solely provides a service that enables Uploaders to share Content that has been uploaded to the service and collect payment for it. Uploaders are responsible for concluding the contract of sale with Recipients and, without limiting the foregoing, are responsible for complying with any applicable laws related to the sale of their Content and for resolving any disputes (if any) with a Recipient directly.
        
    4. To use WeTransfer Paid Transfer, an Uploader must upload their Content to the service and choose to distribute a link transfer. The Uploader must set an expiration date for the link transfer, add a price and share the link transfer with others. Recipients must then click on the link transfer and pay the applicable price for the Content via our third party payment provider, after which the Recipient will be able to download the Content from our service. Uploaders will be informed of any completed purchases by others. Recipients are responsible for downloading Content prior to the expiry date set by the Uploader and for ensuring safe storage of that Content. WeTransfer does not retain any copies of Content after the expiry date of the Content set by the Uploader.
        
    5. Content ownership, permissions and responsibility
        
        1. As an Uploader, you are solely responsible for the Content you upload, share and sell. You retain all rights in- and responsibility and liability for all Content you upload and distribute via WeTransfer Paid Transfer. WeTransfer does not claim ownership of the Content you upload and share via WeTransfer Paid Transfer. You are solely responsible for sharing the link transfer with potential Recipients.  
            
        2. Any Content you upload to our site will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content, but you hereby grant us a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable licence to use, store and copy that Content and to distribute and make it available for promotional purposes (of WeTransfer Paid Transfer) by WeTransfer.
            
        3. Without prejudice to the other provisions of the Terms (which shall continue to apply to your use of WeTransfer Paid Transfer), as an Uploader you agree that:
            
            1. You cannot sell Content or use WeTransfer Paid Transfer in a manner that violates clause 10 (Content ownership, permissions and responsibility) or 11 (Restrictions) of our Terms, or any other applicable laws.

            3. You hereby agree that you will not upload, share or collect payment for any Content that is false or misleading or use WeTransfer Paid Transfer in a manner that is fraudulent or deceptive. WeTransfer is not liable to you or any third party for any damages arising out of or in relation to the Content shared and sold by you within WeTransfer Paid Transfer, including but not limited to, copyright protected works and/or trademarks.
                
        4. As a Recipient you agree that:
            
            1. You will purchase the Content directly from the Uploader. If there is any dispute between you and the Uploader, please contact the Uploader directly. The Uploader is responsible for resolving any dispute between you and them.
                
            2. WeTransfer is not liable to you or any third party for any damages arising out of or in relation to the Content purchased by you within WeTransfer Paid Transfer.
                
    6. Payments
        
        1. WeTransfer has integrated Stripe Connect to process the payments on WeTransfer Paid Transfers.

You warrant that all information that you provide to Stripe in connection with the creation and operation of your account with Stripe will be complete and accurate and that you will not use the Stripe account in any way or for any purpose in breach of Stripe’s Terms and Conditions, these Terms or any applicable laws.  Payments will be processed, collected by Stripe and paid to you by Stripe in accordance with Stripe’s Terms and Conditions. Stripe may charge a transaction fee for each transfer sold with WeTransfer Paid Transfer. You agree that you are responsible for this fee.  
            
        2. As an Uploader, you warrant and agree that:
            
            1. You will not use WeTransfer Paid Transfer and/or your Stripe account in any way or for any purpose in breach of Stripe’s Connected Account Agreement or for any activity that law or Stripe’s terms and conditions prohibits. If WeTransfer becomes aware that or reasonably believes that you are engaging any activity that is fraudulent, deceptive or harmful, or in breach of Stripe’s Connected Account Agreement or Stripe’s Services Agreement, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account without notice. You agree that you will cooperate with us to reduce the risk of fraud or other misuse of Stripe’s services, including for us to receive all relevant information which will be provided to Stripe.
                
            2. You will not use WeTransfer Paid Transfer and/or your Stripe account to conduct a Restricted Business (as defined in the Stripe Connected Account Agreement and Stripe Services Agreement), transact with any such restricted business, or enable any individual or entity (including you) to benefit from any such restricted business.
                
            3. You are solely responsible for (i) determining which, if any, taxes or fees apply in your, the Recipient’s or any other’s jurisdiction arising out of your use of WeTransfer Paid Transfer for the purpose of sharing Content and receiving payment for it; and (ii) assessing, collecting, reporting and remitting those taxes in accordance with any applicable law. In the event that WeTransfer is required by law to provide certain tax notices or tax forms you agree that we shall be entitled to receive these notices and forms and to provide the same to you.
                
            4. You are responsible for initiating and processing any required refunds to the Recipient via the Stripe services. 
                
            5. WeTransfer is not liable for any issues regarding payments made by Recipients, including without limitation charges relating to the processing of your payment, failed payments, chargebacks all of which will be governed by Stripe’s terms and conditions.
                
    7. P2B Regulation clauses _The provisions listed below apply only to Uploaders who have their place of establishment or residence in the EU and who offer Content to consumers located in the EU as part of their business activities._
        
        1. In the event of changes to these Terms, we will provide you with reasonable notice, with a minimum notice period of 15 days. During this notice period, you may terminate your account due to the proposed changes. The proposed changes to the Terms will not take effect until the notice period has expired. This 15-day notice period does not apply if WeTransfer changes the Terms on the basis of a legal or regulatory obligation, or in order to address an unforeseen and imminent danger relating to defending WeTransfer’s business. In such a scenario, the amended Terms will take effect immediately after notification and publication.
            
        2. Eligible Uploaders who have a complaint about WeTransfer Paid Transfer in relation to their business may submit it via our complaint handling system. More information about the filing of such a complaint and the system can be found [here](https://help.wetransfer.com/hc/en-us/articles/17969709747474-How-to-file-a-complaint-EU-users-only).
            
        3. If we are not able to resolve your issue through our complaint-handling system, then the issue can be referred to a third-party mediation service. The mediation costs will be shared by both parties.
            
        4. Without prejudice to the other provisions of the Terms (which shall continue to apply to your use of WeTransfer Paid Transfer), WeTransfer may in certain situations decide to restrict, suspend or terminate your account, and accordingly, your access to our services. This can for example, be the case if you have violated our Terms, if our invoices remain unpaid, if there is an infringement of intellectual property rights of WeTransfer or of other third parties or, if in the opinion of WeTransfer, your use of the services is harmful to WeTransfer’s good name and reputation. If we impose such a restriction, suspension, or termination, we will explain our decision in a statement of reasons. If you disagree with the restriction, suspension, or termination, you may file a complaint via our complaint handling system, as set out above under complaint handling system. 
            
        5. WeTransfer may terminate your account with immediate effect in the event that (i) legal or regulatory obligations require WeTransfer to terminate its services which does not allow it to respect a notice period, (ii) WeTransfer exercises an imperative termination right under national law, or (iii) WeTransfer can demonstrate that you have repeatedly infringed our Terms which resulted in the termination of your account.
            
7. Payment conditions
    
    1. If you use a paid subscription Service, the initial subscription term starts once the fees due have been paid in full.
        
    2. WeTransfer uses Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates and PayPal, Inc. and its affiliates as its third-party service providers for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services) (each a **“Third-Party Service Provider”**). If you make a purchase on the Services, you will be required to provide your payment details and any additional information required to complete your order directly to one of our Third-Party Service Providers. You agree to be bound by Stripe’s Privacy Policy (currently accessible at [https://stripe.com/us/privacy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy)) and its Terms and Conditions (currently accessible at [https://stripe.com/ssa](https://stripe.com/ssa) ) or Paypal’s User Agreement (currently accesible at [https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/useragreement-full?locale.x=en\_US](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/useragreement-full?locale.x=en_US)) and Privacy Statament (currently accessible at [https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full?locale.x=en\_US](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full?locale.x=en_US) ) and hereby consent and authorize WeTransfer and the relevant Third- Party Service Provider to share any information and payment instructions you provide, to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions.  Please note that online payment transactions may be subject to validation checks by our Third-Party Service Providers and your card issuer, and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorize payment for any reason. For your protection, our Third-Party Service Providers use various fraud prevention protocols and industry standard verification systems to reduce fraud and you authorize it to verify and authenticate your payment information. Your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this. In some jurisdictions, our Third-Party Service Providers may use third parties under strict confidentiality and data protection requirements for the purposes of payment processing services.
        
    3. You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee is due and payable. By providing WeTransfer with your payment information, you agree that WeTransfer is authorized to immediately invoice your account for all fees due and payable to WeTransfer hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You shall immediately notify WeTransfer of any change in your payment information to maintain its completeness and accuracy. You agree to have sufficient funds or credit available upon placement of any order to ensure that the purchase price is collectible by us.
        
    4. Your subscription will continue and automatically renew at the price detailed at your time of check-out for such subscription until terminated in accordance with these Terms. The frequency at which your subscription renews (i.e.,  monthly, annually, etc.) will be designated at the time at which you sign up for the subscription. By subscribing, you authorize WeTransfer to charge the payment method designated in your account now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if WeTransfer does not receive payment, (i) you shall pay all amounts due on your account upon demand and/or (ii) you agree that WeTransfer may either terminate, cancel or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your designated payment method until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received). Termination, cancellation or suspension of the Services for non-payment can result in a loss of access to and use of your account and your Content.
        
    5. We may introduce or change the fees for the Services from time to time, for which we will give you advance notice. If you do not agree with the price change, you may cancel your subscription in accordance with clauses 8.3 and 8.4 and stop using the Services by the end of the then-current Service term. If you continue to use the Services after the price change goes into effect, you agree to pay the changed price. Fee introductions will require your prior consent and registration.
        
    6. You can change your payment method in your account settings of the respective Service or by contacting our [Help Center.](https://help.wetransfer.com/hc/en-us)
        
    7. If you subscribe and pay us through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, the terms of Apple or Google may also apply.
        
8. Term and cancellation of a subscription
    
    1. The initial subscription term varies depending on your choice and/or the Service it applies to.
        
    2. Apart from your cancellation rights under local mandatory consumer law, you have the right to cancel your subscription during the first 14 days, unless you start using the Service during this period whereby you waive your right to cancel.
        
    3. The subscription period will be renewed automatically for the selected subscription period, unless you have cancelled your subscription on time (before the last day of your subscription). If you do not wish your account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or cancel your subscription, you must contact WeTransfer at support@wetransfer.com, or log in and go to the “Cancel Subscription” section in your “Account / Workspace” area.
        
    4. Upon cancellation you will continue to have access to the Services until the end of your then current paid subscription period. For instance: if the commencement date of your annual subscription is 2 February and you cancel your subscription on 17 December, you will continue to have access until the end of day on the following 1 February and your subscription will not automatically renew. Where a cancellation occurs as a result of your breach to our terms and conditions, you shall lose access to the Services immediately. For the avoidance of doubt, a Collect subscription is linked to your WeTransfer subscription. A cancellation of this subscription will result in a loss of access to Collect. The initial subscription term varies depending on your choice and/or the Service it applies to. Cancellation pursuant to clause 8.3 does not give you any right to reimbursement of (part of) the subscription fee, unless local mandatory consumer law obliges us to do so.
        
    5. In case your subscription is automatically renewed for a period of more than three (3) months, you will have the right to cancel the subscription at any time after such renewal with a cancellation term of one (1) month. In case of cancellation based on this clause you may request reimbursement of part of the subscription fee. This means that you pay for the period until the cancellation enters into force, based on the standard monthly fee for the respective Service.
        
    6. If you subscribe through the Apple App Store or Google Play store, the terms of Apple App Store or Google Play store may apply to the terms and cancellation of your subscription instead of or in addition to the terms in this clause.
        
9. WeTransfer Teams - Payment, term and cancellation
    
    1. A Teams account is registered on behalf of its Team Owner. The Team Owner will be billed for all team members that are subscribed to the Teams account.
        
    2. The Team Owner and individual team members can add team members to the Teams account, after which such new team members have immediate access to the account. If team members are added during a current subscription period, the Team Owner is charged pro rata for the days that remain during that subscription period. After that, the Team Owner will be fully charged for the new team member in the next paid subscription period.
        
    3. The Team Owner and individual team members can remove team members from the Teams account, after which such team members will immediately lose access to the account. If team members are removed during a current subscription period, the Team Owner will be charged for this team member until the end of that paid subscription period. The Team Owner will not be charged for the removed team member in the next paid subscription period.
        
    4. Any unused days in a paid subscription period due to the removal of a team member, may be used for a newly added team member during that same paid subscription period.
        
    5. If a Teams account is cancelled, the Team Owner and team members continue to have access to the Teams account until the end of the paid subscription period. After the paid subscription period, the Team Owner and the team members will automatically get access to an individual, free WeTransfer account.

    1. WeTransfer does not claim any ownership of the Content you create, use, store or share through the Services and you are solely responsible for it.

    6. WeTransfer does not provide any public search function, catalogue or listing to find Content.
        
    7. WeTransfer may show you ads from advertisers and artists selected by WeTransfer (such as full-page wallpaper ads) when you use the Services.
        
    8. More information on the use of your personal data and cookies (including for performance marketing) is available in our [Privacy & Cookie Statement](https://wetransfer.com/legal/privacy).
        
    9. With respect to any mobile application(s) that we offer subject to these Terms and accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “App Store Sourced Application”), you shall only use the App Store Sourced Application (i) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple Media Terms of Service([https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/)), except that such App Store Sourced Application may be accessed, acquired, and used by other accounts associated with the purchaser via Apple’s Family Sharing function, volume purchasing, or Legacy Contacts function ([https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/)). Notwithstanding the first sentence in this clause, with respect to any mobile application accessed through or downloaded from the Google Play store (a **“Google Play Sourced Application”**), you may have additional license rights with respect to use of any mobile application(s) offered by WeTransfer on a shared basis within your designated family group.
        
    10. The following applies to any App Store Sourced Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store:

        2. In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App Store Sourced Application to you and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. As between WeTransfer and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of WeTransfer.
            
        3. You and WeTransfer acknowledge that, as between WeTransfer and Apple, Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
            
        4. You and WeTransfer acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between WeTransfer and Apple, WeTransfer, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms.

    3. To the extent permissible under local mandatory law, WeTransfer may change, terminate or expand its Services and site from time to time and reserves the right to limit access to or eliminate any features or functionality of the Services in its own discretion, without giving prior notice. We will use reasonable efforts to give you notice of any major changes in our Services including cancellation, upgrades, downgrades and where applicable, prorated refunds of subscription packages.
        
    4. Some of the Services require you to register and provide us with data such as your email address, password and/or payment details. You must ensure that these are accurate and keep them updated in your account settings. You are responsible for any activity from or by your account, so you should not share your password and you should protect it carefully. Should registrations or account data appear to be misused, WeTransfer reserves the right to delete the account. WeTransfer is not liable for any loss or damage arising from the unauthorized use of your account.
        
    5.

15. Indemnity and Liability
    
    1. You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless WeTransfer (including its employees and affiliates) from and against any claims, incidents, liabilities, procedures, damages, losses and expenses (including legal and accounting fees), arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Services or your breach of these Terms, including any third party claims that Content created, used, stored or shared using the Services by you or through your account, infringe or violate any third party rights.

In the event WeTransfer is liable for damage under mandatory law, WeTransfer’s aggregate liability to you - to the extent permissible under local mandatory law - for any and all claims arising out of or in connection with the use of the Services will in no event exceed the greater amount of (i) one hundred dollars ($100) per incident or (ii) the fees paid by you in the month of the occurrence giving rise to the liability.
        
16. Waiver, Severability & Assignment
    
    1. WeTransfer’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
        
    2. If any (part of a) provision of these Terms is found to be illegal, unenforceable or otherwise invalid, then (i) the rest of the Terms will remain in full force and effect to the extent permissible under or consistent with the relevant laws; and (ii) that part will be deemed to be deleted and substituted by a valid one which in its economic effect comes closest to the invalid part.
        
    3. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms. WeTransfer is at any time entitled to assign its rights and obligations under these Terms to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor or assign (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise)without your consent or any other restriction.
        
17. Arbitration agreement
    
    1. **Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. This applies to U.S. residential users only.** Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and WeTransfer agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, or the Terms and prior versions of the Terms, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms (each, a **“Dispute”**) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (i) you and WeTransfer may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you or WeTransfer may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Terms as well as claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. 
        
    2. **Informal Dispute Resolution.** There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and WeTransfer. If that occurs, WeTransfer is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and WeTransfer agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and WeTransfer therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“**Informal Dispute Resolution Conference**”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference. The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“**Notice**”), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to WeTransfer that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to support@wetransfer.com or regular mail to our offices located at Keizersgracht 281, 1016 ED, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Notice must include: (i) your name, telephone number, mailing address, email address associated with your account (if you have one); (ii) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (iii) a description of your Dispute. WeTransfer will send a Notice and a description of the Dispute to your email address or regular address on file. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information up to date. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this clause.
        
    3. **Waiver of Jury Trial.** YOU AND WETRANSFER HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and WeTransfer are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the subclause entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
        
    4. **Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.** YOU AND WETRANSFER AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the subclause 17.9 entitled “Batch Arbitration.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this subclause, “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and WeTransfer agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subclause does not prevent you or WeTransfer from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.
        
    5. **Rules and Forum**. The Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within 60 days after receipt of a Notice, you and WeTransfer agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “**AAA Rules**”) then in effect, except as supplemented, where applicable, by AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/Rules. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “**Request**”). A Request to WeTransfer should be sent either by mail to Keizersgracht 281, 1016 ED, Amsterdam, the Netherlands or by email to legal@wetransfer.com. A Request to you will be sent to your email address or regular address on file. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information up to date. The Request must include: (i) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (ii) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (iii) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (iv) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (v) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (i) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (ii) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (iii) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator. The arbitration hearing (if any) will be held by videoconference, unless either party requests an in-person hearing and the arbitrator agrees. If an in-person hearing is required, it will be held in the county where you live, or as determined by the arbitrator (in the case of Batch Arbitration). Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA Rules. You and WeTransfer agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential. You and WeTransfer also agree that at least 14 days before the date set for an arbitration hearing, any party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover any post-offer costs to which they otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer.
        
    6. **Arbitrator**. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under subclause 17.9 is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 14 days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
        
    7. **Authority of Arbitrator.** The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except that all Disputes regarding the subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” including any claim that all or part of that subsection is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that that such subsection has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
        
    8. **Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.** The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or WeTransfer need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.
        
    9. **Batch Arbitration.** To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and WeTransfer agree that in the event that there are ten (10) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against WeTransfer by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a ninety (90) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (i) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (or, if between ten (10) and ninety-nine (99) individual Requests are filed, a single batch of all those Requests, and, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests remaining after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests) (ii) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (iii) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“**Batch Arbitration**”). All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (**“Administrative Arbitrator”**). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by WeTransfer. You and WeTransfer agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (i) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.
        
    10. **30-Day Right to Opt Out.** You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out via mail to: Keizersgracht 281, 1016 ED, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, or via email to legal@wetransfer.com within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your WeTransfer account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
        
    11. **Invalidity, Expiration.** Except as provided in the subclause entitled “Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief”, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with WeTransfer as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.
        
    12. **Modification.** Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if WeTransfer makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject the change within 30 days of such change become effective by writing to WeTransfer at Keizersgracht 281, 1016 ED, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Your continued use of the WeTransfer Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the WeTransfer website following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services or of the WeTransfer website, any communications you receive, or these Terms, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) remain in full force and effect. WeTransfer will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms.
        
    13. **Governing Courts**. To the extent that the Dispute is not covered by any arbitration agreement between you and us, it shall proceed before the state or federal courts located in the State of California (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside).
        
18. Governing Law
    
    1. **FOR** **US RESIDENTS USERS ONLY:** These Terms and any actions arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the State laws of California, without giving effect to any conflict of law or other principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) does not apply to these Terms.
        
    2. **FOR ALL OTHER USERS**: Because your contract is with WeTransfer B.V., these Terms, including their subject matter and their formation, and any disputes between us, are governed by Dutch law (with the exception of Dutch private international law). Any disputes arising from or relating in any way to these Terms will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of a competent court in the Netherlands. If you are an individual consumer, you may be entitled to invoke the mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence, and/or to bring legal proceedings in the courts of that country. If WeTransfer needs to enforce its rights against you as an individual consumer, we will do so only in your country of residence. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) does not apply to these Terms.
