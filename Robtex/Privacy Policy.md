Founded in 1989, we have been around long enough to know that privacy is important and something that should not be taken lightly. However, in order for our users to get the best experience possible, some anonymous information is collected, but only when deemed necessary for the siteâ€™s functionality. The information listed below is to be considered accurate until informed otherwise:

\- We allow third-party companies to serve us with targeted ads, based on the geographical location of our users. This is done by collecting your IP-address upon connect (something anyone could potentially do). These companies may in turn use this non-personally identifiable information to improve the efficiency of their advertisement by listing ads for goods and services that are related to your location, which may thus be of greater interest to you.

\- We allow third-party companies to gather statistics, including (but not limited to): time spent on robtex.com, advertisements clicked, browser type and time/date of the visit. This information is collected through the use of cookies. Cookies are small text files sent to you through your browser, provided you allow them. This enables them to remember the aforementioned anonymous information about you as a user, so that we may improve our website and develop and consequently offer better tools in the future.

\- We do not allow information gathered by the aforementioned third-party services to be sold, traded, shared or otherwise made available to anyone not associated with robtex.com or its third party-services, except for purposes of assisting us in operating our website, conducting our business or servicing you as our user, as long as confidentiality is guaranteed by anyone privy to the information. This confidentially agreement includes anyone solicited through third-party services or anyone otherwise assisting us in better understanding our site visitors. In compliance with the law, there are exceptions to when this confidentiality agreement is applicable. For more information on this, please refer to your local legal jurisdiction.

\- At our discretion, we may include or offer links to third party products. These products are displayed through partner contracts with third-party vendors. These third party sites have independent privacy policies. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for anything displayed on a website reached through a link on http://www.robtex.com or on any of our associated sites.

At robtex.com, we always seek to ensure the highest level of privacy for our users and constantly seek new technological solutions to further improve our service. We welcome any and all feedback on this or any other matter. Please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate your feedback!
