Terms of Service
================

_Last revised December 16, 2019_

This agreement governs your access to and use of Boardhost.com, Inc.'s (hereafter referred to as "Boardhost") Flagcounter.com service's counters, facilities, and services (collectively the "Service"). In consideration for your right to use the Service, you agree as follows:  
  
**SERVICE PROVIDED**  
  
Boardhost provides the capability of creation and/or use of website counters, to the user, who is at least eighteen (18) years old, or is a minor over the age of thirteen (13) who has parental permission. Service is provided "as is." There may, among other things, be unexpected downtimes, loss of data, delays or interruptions of service. BOARDHOST SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTERRUPTIONS OR DATA LOSSES, OR OTHERWISE AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

When you create a counter, Boardhost may provide an HTML and/or Javascript code for you to include on your website (or any other page where you include such code, hereafter referred to simply as "Your website") to use certain features that we provide. Boardhost cannot guarantee that such code will not interfere with other elements of Your website or that such coding will at all times work as described. You may not modify provided codes in any manner and you may not intentionally conceal the visual display of your counter from Your website. You further may not remove the link leading back to your counter's statistical information.

Boardhost is not obligated to monitor the Service, but may do so and may remove or edit any counter created through our site, or adjust your access to the Service. Counters that Boardhost may, in its sole discretion, elect to remove or edit include without limitation those which violate the "Restrictions" enumerated herein.

Counters and their content are provided for entertainment only, and their content is subject to error and innaccuracies. We cannot guarantee, for instance, that the counts indicated represent anything other than a minimum number of times the counter was loaded from our server, nor can we guarantee the accuracy of the originating country and/or other information assigned to an individual visitor. Further, your counter code could be placed elsewhere on the Internet by automated robots or by unscrupulous or other third parties. Such placement may result in a distortion of your intended count of visitors.

Counters provided through our service can only count visitors that directly load the associated image from our server. Modifications to your code and/or the functionality of your code, and/or the implementation of proxy servers, advertisement blocking or other software on Your website or by Your website's visitors may result in incorrect information and/or limited or no information being recorded.

You agree that if your counter is or is expected to be viewed more than 5,000,000 times in a single month, to contact us to ensure that adequate resources are available. If you do not recieve our written confirmation of such, your counter may be temporarily or permanently deactivated until such resources become available.

You may not place your counter on websites of which you do not own or operate, or which you have obtained permission from the person who does own or operate the site. You further may not include your counter in "comments" to sites that you do not own or operate.

Boardhost may place advertisements on any counters created on our site, and on associated information pages, in exchange for the service provided. It is Boardhost's sole discretion as to how many advertisements appear, and the form of these advertisements.

**RESTRICTIONS**  
  
You may use our Service for legal purposes only, and further may not use our Service on any website that contains or promotes any of the following:

Individuals or organizations that promote or use spamming (unsolicited bulk e-mail) or methods thereof are not allowed to use our site. Any reported incident of spamming, or any form of unsolicited e-mail or newsgroup posting that includes a link to or references to a counter or its associated content, may result in IMMEDIATE termination of any related counters, and a ban from using any future Boardhost services.  
  
Furthermore, you may not include a counter in ANY e-mail message, including but not limited to e-mail newsletters.  
  
**TERMINATION**

Any counters you create and their associated data may be removed for inactivity at Boardhost's discretion. Ordinarily, this will occur if your counter has not had a new visitor in over 30 days.  
  
Should any credit or debit card or other payment method used to pay for Boardhost's services be rejected or should your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seek return of payment previously made to Boardhost where Boardhost believes you are liable for the charge, your Service will be immediately terminated and you will be barred from using our services in the future.
