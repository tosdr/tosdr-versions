Such notice may be sent to you by email to your most recently provided email address or posted on the Site or by any other manner chosen by RoPro in its commercially reasonable discretion. You will be deemed to have received any such notice that is posted on the Site on the day it was posted. Your use of the Services after the ten (10) day notice period constitutes your acceptance of the new or revised Fees. If you do not agree to the revised Fees, you may cancel your subscription at any time in the "Manage Your Subscription" section of the RoPro Site.

### Continuous membership

To ensure uninterrupted service, all subscriptions to the Site, Software and Services are renewed automatically.

Termination and refund policy
-----------------------------

This Agreement shall continue until you cancel your subscription or until terminated by RoPro. You may cancel your subscription at any time. To cancel your subscription, please visit the "Manage Your Subscription" section of the RoPro Site (found at https://ropro.io/subscription).

If you cancel after your subscription renewal date, you will not receive a refund for any amounts that have been charged. Your cancellation will be effective at the end of your then-current subscription period, subject to applicable law, and you may use the Services until your cancellation is effective (unless your access is suspended or terminated as set forth below).

RoPro may deny you access to all or any part of the Services or terminate your subscription with or without prior notice if you engage in any conduct or activities that RoPro determines, in its sole discretion, violate this Agreement or the rights of RoPro or any third party, or is otherwise inappropriate. Without limitation, RoPro may deny you access to the Services, or terminate this Agreement and your subscription, if your use of the Services exceeds the 30-day and 48-hour use limitations or 365-day and 48-hour use limitations set forth under the section titled “License.”

Upon termination of your RoPro subscriptions(s) for any reason, your right to use the Services and Software and to access the Site and any of its content will immediately cease and all content in your account(s) will be deleted.
