merging, or otherwise reorganizing one or more of our businesses. In negotiating with a

third party about entering into such an arrangement, we may need to disclose your

purchaser to sign a non-disclosure agreement limiting the use and protecting the

confidentiality of the personal information.

the Site to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, transfer of

us manage the Site and allow us to better serve our visitors and customers. These may

include third-party vendors we engage to analyze the information we collect for marketing

or similar purposes. We may contract with third parties who use cookies to collect

information on our behalf. These parties maintain their own confidentiality and security

standards. If you would like to opt out of this use of your information, you can change the

companies or others to provide certain services, including payment services, data

have access to personal information for a limited purpose and for a limited period, and we

implement contractual protections limiting the use of that personal information to the

provision of services to us.

Do Not Track Mechanisms. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision

within the industry regarding the meaning of Do Not Track signals, we currently do not

make any guarantee that we will honor Do Not Track signals.



Third-Party Links



The Site contains links to other websites. We encourage all our partners, contributors, and

third parties to implement policies and practices that respect the privacy of our users;

however, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such websites or

activities of our partners, contributors, and third parties in how they handle your data.

California Consumer Privacy Act and California Shine the Light Law



If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) California

Civil Code 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your

personal information by certain of our members to third parties for the third parties’ direct

marketing purposes.



The CCPA gives you certain rights with respect to the processing of your personal data.

Under the CCPA, you may request information about our collection, use, and disclosure

of your personal information over the prior 12 months, and ask that we provide you with

the following information:



• Categories of and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about

you.

• Categories of sources from which we collect personal information.

• Purposes for collecting, using, or selling personal information.

• Categories of third parties with which we share personal information.

• Categories of personal information disclosed about you for a business purpose.



The CCPA also allows you to request that we delete your personal information, subject to

certain exceptions. Under the CCPA, a “sale” means providing to a third-party personal

information for valuable consideration. We have taken substantial steps to identify

whether any of our data sharing arrangements would constitute a “sale” under the CCPA,

and have maintained that we do not sell or rent personal information to unaffiliated third

parties for their advertising or marketing lists.

To make a request regarding your personal data or other rights under this section, please

send an email to support@angeiongroup.com.

guardian, please contact us using the information provided below so that we can take

appropriate action.
