**Rubble, Rage, Resistance: A Year of Covering the 'Most Documented Genocide in History'**

Since October 2023, TRNN has produced over 25 on-the-ground, documentary reports from Gaza, the West Bank, and protest movements around the world. We also published [**over 100 original podcasts**, **articles, and livestreams**](https://therealnews.com/israels-war-on-palestine) providing analysis, context, and firsthand stories from the front lines of struggle.

We can't continue this vital work without your support. Your donation helps us expose injustice, amplify the stories of the oppressed, and hold those in power accountable.

Join us in standing with those fighting for survival—because their stories need to be told.

Need to share something sensitive with The Real News?

Use SecureDrop, an anonymity tool for journalists and whistleblowers.

SecureDrop is an anonymity tool for journalists and whistleblowers. You can use our SecureDrop installation to anonymously submit documents to The Real News, and our journalists can use SecureDrop to securely communicate with anonymous contacts.

To protect your anonymity when using SecureDrop, it is essential that you do not use a network or device that can easily be traced back to your real identity. Instead, use public wifi networks and devices you control.

Do NOT access SecureDrop on your employer’s network.  
Do NOT access SecureDrop using your employer’s hardware.  
Do NOT access SecureDrop on your home network.  
DO access SecureDrop on a network not associated with you, like the wifi at a library or cafe.

Once you are connected to a public network at a cafe or library, download and install the desktop version of [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

Launch Tor Browser. Visit our organization’s unique SecureDrop URL at http://isomzhlu2hqz2ll6t3c7mt67j3mvad2omzptk6cnc2ce2fzdabjjmnid.onion/. Follow the instructions you find on our source page to send us materials and messages.

When you make your first submission, you will receive a unique codename. Memorize it. If you write it down, be sure to destroy the copy as soon as you’ve committed it to memory. Use your codename to sign back in to our source page, check for responses from our journalists, and upload additional materials.

No tool can absolutely guarantee your security or anonymity. The best way to protect your privacy and anonymity as a source is to adhere to best practices.

You can use a separate computer you’ve designated specifically to handle the submission process. Or, you can use an alternate operating system like Tails, which boots from a USB stick and erases your activity at the end of every session.

A file contains valuable [metadata](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/why-metadata-matters) about its source — when it was created and downloaded, what machine was involved, the machine’s owner, etc. You can scrub metadata from some files prior to submission using the Metadata Anonymization Toolkit featured in Tails.

Your online behavior can be extremely revealing. Regularly monitoring our publication’s social media or website can potentially flag you as a source. Take great care to think about what your online behavior might reveal, and consider using Tor Browser to mitigate such monitoring.

Our organization retains strict access control over our SecureDrop project. A select few journalists within our organization will have access to SecureDrop submissions. We control the servers that store your submissions, so no third party has direct access to the metadata or content of what you send us.

Do not discuss leaking or whistleblowing, even with trusted contacts.

Send us physical mail.

Sending us physical mail is also an option that can preserve your anonymity, especially if you use a public mailbox:
