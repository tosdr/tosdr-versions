2. How do we use personal data?
    ----------------------------
    
    Our use of personal data depends on which services you are using, where provided by the company you are engaging with, as outlined below:
    
    1. ### If you visit our websites
        
    
    If you visit our websites, we will process details of your IT device and website usage, to help manage website security and performance, as a reasonable and legitimate business interest.
    
    Our websites contain links to and from other external websites, such as those of auctioneers, our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any external websites, please note that these websites have their own processes and privacy notices and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these notices, for data you give to those organisations, nor for their processing. Please check their notices before you share any personal data with those websites or organisations.
    
    Our websites also use cookies to store data on your IT device related to your use of our websites. Further details can be found on our Cookie Notice page, which can be accessed [here](https://www.bidspotter.com/en-us/about-us/legal/cookie-policy)  or via the link at the bottom of our webpages.
    
    5. ### If you contact us
        
    
    We will use the information you provide, including your user and contact details, to help us address the matter you have raised, as a reasonable and legitimate business interest.
    
    7. ### If you subscribe to our communications
        
    
    If you subscribe to our newsletters, promotional communications, and updates, we will process your user and contact details to provide the requested information, as a reasonable and legitimate business interest. You can unsubscribe from those communications, which you can do at any time by:
    
    * Contacting us via contact details provided on this website;
    * Using the “unsubscribe” link in emails or “STOP” number in texts; or
    * Updating your marketing preferences via the preference center for your account.
    
    10. ### If you participate in a survey, competition, webcast or promotion
        
    
    We will process the data you provide for that specific activity, including user and contact details.
    
    Some activities will also provide the option to opt-in to marketing updates and offers, if you provide your consent.
    
    13. ### If you register on our site and/or as a bidder in any auctions
        
    
    If you register on our websites and watch list a lot, we send a watch list update via email as a reasonable and legitimate business interest for items that have been watch listed to support purchasing decisions. Site registrants can unsubscribe from these updates at any time. We also send these messages via SMS to registrants who have opted in to this service.
    
    If you register as a bidder for one or more auctions via our website, we will process the personal data that is necessary for us to provide our services to you, including sign-up, identification, safeguarding, service updates, product updates, bidding, winning, payment, any payment defaults, shipping, feedback, legal compliance and bidder support, under our contractual obligations.
    
    Over time, as necessary for the fulfilment of the contract, this will include user contact details, IT device, website usage, bid, purchase and payment histories.
    
    We will perform risk-based analysis of bidder data for fraud prevention purposes (preventing and detecting crime) and to determine your eligibility to bid, during sign-up and periodically when risks are identified once you have become a customer.
    
    We contact bidders directly, via email, for communications that are necessary for contractual or legal reasons, such as operational issues, delivery information or payment updates. We send auction updates via email to bidders who have registered for auctions as a reasonable and legitimate business interest and to support purchasing decisions. Bidders can unsubscribe from these updates at any time. We also send these messages via SMS to bidders who have opted in to this service.
    
    We do not share SMS messaging originator opt-in data and consent with any third parties.
    
    Targeted adverts will also be presented on other websites that you visit.
    
    We also use anonymised data to analyse aggregated customer trends and business performance over time.
    
    **Bidding**
    
    If you register to bid in an auction via one of our websites, we will share your contact details and bid, purchase and payment histories via our website with the relevant auctioneer in order to enable the auctioneer to determine whether to approve you to bid in their auction.
    
    **Winning Bids**
    
    If you win a bid, we will share your contact details, purchase and payment details (as a tokenised version of your payment card via our PCI compliant gateway) with the auctioneer for that auction, for them to fulfil the order. That auctioneer is responsible for confirming your winning bid and delivering the goods you have purchased from them. Where we are shipping the product, we will also process your details as necessary for the delivery, including the necessary sharing of your data with shipping companies.
    
    Those auctioneers and shipping companies will be operating as an independent data controllers for the purpose of processing that data. We have no control or liability for the use of data by those auctioneers, and their own policies and notices.
    
    Any issues with the goods you have purchased must be raised directly with your auctioneer.
    
    **Payments**
    
    Credit/debit card and bank account payment services for customers are provided by specialist third parties, who operate as independent data controllers. Their policies, notices and controls apply. We will retain partial information, such as a “credit card transaction token” and the final four digits of the card number, so that we can identify the transaction, but that information cannot be used to initiate further transactions.
    
    **Protecting Our Auction Community**
    
    We take reasonable proactive steps to help protect all parties that we work with, from illegal, unfair or inappropriate behaviours as is necessary under our contractual agreement.
    
    We will monitor positive and negative account activities, including user contact details, IT device, website usage, bid, purchase and payment histories. We share such information between other relevant partners, such as auctioneers, to help parties manage their commercial risks under our collaborative auction service.
    
    Users, accounts and services may be suspended, blocked or closed where behaviours are thought by us in our sole discretion to be inappropriate or create a commercial risk. You will be directly notified of any such action, if applicable to you save where we are legally prevented from providing such notification. To dispute an account action, contact our customer services team.
    
    We reserve the right to take legal or debt collection actions against organisations or individuals where relevant, and will share data with necessary parties, such as law enforcement, debt collection agencies and credit bureaus, in order to do so.
    
    **White Labelled Auction IT Platforms**
    
    Where we are providing technological services to an auctioneer (including via our Auction Mobility software), such that you are direct customer of the auctioneer, the auctioneer is the data controller and we are their data processor for this processing. The auctioneer is responsible for the use of your data. Any requests you wish to raise must be raised directly with auctioneer for that auction.
