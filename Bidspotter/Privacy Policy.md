2. How do we use personal data?
    ----------------------------
    
    Our use of personal data depends on which services you are using as outlined below:
    
    1. ### If you visit our websites
        
    
    If you visit our websites, we will process details of your IT device (such as your computer, phone, tablet, or other device) and website usage to help manage website security and website performance, as a reasonable and legitimate business interest.
    
    Our websites contain links to and from other external websites, such as those of auctioneers, our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any external websites, please note that these websites have their own processes and privacy notices and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these notices, for data you give to those organisations, nor for their processing. Please check their notices before you share any personal data with those websites or organisations.
    
    Our websites also use cookies to store data on your IT device related to your use of our websites. Further details can be found on our Cookie Notice page, which can be accessed via the link at the bottom of our webpages. If you have a Facebook account, we will share your ATG account flag, so that Facebook can send you targeted marketing but only if you have opted in to this via your Facebook account. Please contact us if you want to opt out, using the details above.
    
    5. ### If you contact us
        
    
    We will use the information you provide, including your user details and contact details, to discuss the matter you have raised, as a reasonable and legitimate business interest.
    
    7. ### If you subscribe to our communications
        
    
    If you subscribe to our newsletters, promotional communications, and updates, we will process your user and contact details to provide the requested information, as a reasonable and legitimate business interest. You can unsubscribe from those communications at any time by:
    
    * Contacting us via contact details provided on this website;
    * Using the “unsubscribe” link in emails or “STOP” number in texts; or
    * Updating your marketing preferences via the preference center for your account.
    
    10. ### If you participate in a survey, competition, loyalty reward program, webcast or promotion
        
    
    We will process the data you provide for that specific activity, including user and contact details. This may include postal, telephone, email, SMS or social media communications related to that activity.
    
    Some activities will also provide the option to opt-in to marketing updates and offers, if you provide your consent.
    
    13. ### If you join our auction community by registering on our site
        
    
    If you register on our website, we will process the personal data that is necessary for us to provide our services to you, including sign-up, identification, service updates, product updates, bidding, winning, payment, any payment defaults, shipping, feedback, legal compliance and bidder support, under our contractual obligations.
    
    Over time, as necessary for the fulfilment of the contract, personal data will include user contact details, IT device, website usage, bid, purchase, risk and payment histories.
    
    We may send newsletters, a timely reminder of lots, watchlists or auctions for which you have registered via SMS, in-app notifications or email, as a reasonable and legitimate business interest, so you are less likely to miss an auction. You can opt out from receiving these messages any time.
    
    We may perform risk-based analysis of bidder data for fraud and crime prevention purposes, as a public interest, and to determine your eligibility to bid, during sign-up and once you have become a registered bidder. We may notify our business partners, such as auctioneers, of potential high-risk activities to help protect our community by detecting, investigating and preventing unusual account activities.
    
    We contact bidders directly, via email, with communications that are necessary for contractual or legal reasons, such as operational issues, delivery information or payment updates.
    
    Adverts that have been specifically selected for you will also be presented on other websites, such as social media websites, that you visit as a legitimate business interest. Those websites use their cookies (with your consent) or one-way-encrypted (hashed) email address to identify your account. Those websites will not have access to your auctioneer or bidder account or bidding data. You can opt out of this by changing your account setting or preferences on these websites.
    
    We also anonymise user data, so that we can anonymously analyse aggregated customer trends and business performance over time as a legitimate business interest.
    
    21. ### Bidding
        
    
    If you register to bid in an auction via one of our websites, we will share your contact details and bid, purchase and payment histories via our website with the relevant auctioneer to enable the auctioneer to determine whether to approve you to bid in their auction.
    
    23. ### Winning Bids
        
    
    If you win a lot as a result of a bid placed via our website, we will share your contact details, purchase and payment details (using a tokenised version of your payment card) with the auctioneer for that auction, for them to fulfil the order. That auctioneer is responsible for confirming your winning bid and delivering the goods you have purchased from them. Where we are shipping the lot, we will also process your details as necessary for the delivery, including the necessary sharing of your data with shipping companies.
    
    Those auctioneers and shipping companies will be operating as independent data controllers for the purpose of processing that data. We have no control or liability for the use of data by those companies, and their own policies and notices apply.
    
    Any issues with the goods you have purchased must be raised directly with the auctioneer.
    
    27. ### Payments
        
    
    Where financial transactions require bank account details to be processed, we will only use those details for the purpose of agreed payments.
    
    Payment cards services for bidders are provided by specialist third parties such as Payrix, Plug'n Pay Technologies, and Global Payments, who operate as independent data controllers. Their policies, notices and controls apply. We will retain partial information, such as a “card transaction token”.
    
    We store your Bank Account Information (including the name, routing number, account number, and current balance of your account at a financial institution from which you may make payments). We use Plaid to authenticate information regarding your account. We may use this information to execute transactions and debit your account.
    
    31. ### Protecting Our Auction Community
        
    
    We take reasonable proactive steps to help protect all parties that we work with, from illegal, unfair, or inappropriate behaviours, as a reasonable public interest.
    
    We will monitor positive and negative account activities, including user contact details, IT device, website usage, bid, purchase and payment histories. We share such information with partners, such as auctioneers and relevant third party service providers, to help all parties manage their commercial risks and prevent fraud under our collaborative auction service.
    
    Accounts and services may be suspended, blocked or closed where behaviours are thought by us in our sole discretion to be inappropriate or create a commercial risk. You will be notified directly of any such action, if applicable to you. To dispute an account action, contact our customer services team.
    
    We reserve the right to take legal or debt collection actions against organisations or individuals where relevant, and will share data with necessary parties, such as law enforcement, debt collection agencies and credit bureaus, in order to do so.
    
    36. ### White Labelled Auction Platforms
        
    
    Where we are providing technological services to an auctioneer, such that you are the direct customer of the auctioneer, the auctioneer is the data controller and we are their data processor for this processing. The auctioneer is responsible for the use of your data. Any requests you wish to raise must be raised directly with the auctioneer for that auction.
    
    38. ### Engaging as an Auctioneer or Seller
        
    
    We will process contact details of the people working for auctioneer, in order to professionally engage with your organisations, for business-to-business purposes, as a legitimate business interest.
    
    40. ### Journalism
        
    
    We will publish information that we believe to be newsworthy, in relation to our business or auction industry, as a public interest. This can include names, locations, companies and auction related information.
    
3. Your Rights
