Publisher will not run, place, display or link Ad Units on or to any web site or mobile application (including Publisher Sites) that contains indecent, obscene or pornographic material, hate speech, offensive or illegal subject matter, or that relates to illegal or misleading activities.
3. 1.3 For the purposes hereof, “LifeStreet Integration” is defined as the process by which connection and communication to the LifeStreet server is made for purposes of delivering or serving Ad Units to Publisher Sites. A LifeStreet Integration becomes available, either via the LifeStreet Software Development Kit, by API Server Integration, or by HTML Insertion Code, either of which is licensed to Publisher hereunder. For the purposes hereof:
    1. 1.3.1 “LifeStreet Software Development Kit” (hereafter, LifeStreet SDK) is defined and licensed hereunder as the compiled or source code version of the licensed computer software programs provided by LifeStreet for downloading and use for the sole purpose of connecting Publisher Sites to the LifeStreet servers for the purposes of delivering Ad Units.

4. 1.4 Publisher’s use of any LifeStreet Integration will not violate any third party restrictions that may exist. Further, Publisher shall not alter, sell or disclose the LifeStreet Integration, or any component thereof, in any way without LifeStreet’s prior written consent.

This arrangement will be referred to herein as the “Program”.
2. 2.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, LifeStreet hereby grants Publisher a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right during the Term to use the LifeStreet Integration methods for the purpose of displaying Ad Units, in each case on the Program Sites in connection with the Program and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and applicable laws. LifeStreet hereby reserves all rights in and to the LifeStreet Integration that are not expressly granted to Publisher hereunder.
3. 2.3 Publisher agrees that LifeStreet will serve the Ad Units to the Program Sites. Publisher agrees to comply with the specifications provided by LifeStreet from time to time to enable proper delivery, display, tracking, and reporting of the Ad Units in connection with the Program Sites, by not modifying the embed code or other programming in the LifeStreet HTML Insertion Code in any way, unless expressly authorized in writing by LifeStreet.
4. 2.4 Publisher acknowledges and agrees that Publisher is solely responsible for the Publisher Sites, including all content and materials, and maintenance and operation thereof; the proper implementation of LifeStreet’s specifications; and adherence to the terms of this Agreement.

Publisher acknowledges and agrees that Publisher is solely responsible for accuracy of payee information entered into the Publisher Portal and any payment(s) remitted by LifeStreet to the specified payee listed in the Publisher Portal shall fulfill LifeStreet’s obligation for such payment(s).
