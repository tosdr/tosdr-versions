    * We may also collect details of other interactions that you have with us, together with any other information that you choose to provide us with, for example, through your interactions with our customer and technical support teams. 
    * We do not however collect any unnecessary personal information from Registrants (for instance, information about religious beliefs). 
    * It is impractical in most circumstances for you to remain anonymous, and we may not be able to interact with you, provide access to the Site, or answer your enquiry if we are not able to identify you or collect your personal information. 
    * In the case of school/educational institution customers (**School Customer**), we seek consent from the School Customer to be provided with Registrant information for and on behalf of that student or teacher. 
    * In the case of individual / home subscriptions (**Home Customers**) we seek consent from the Home Customer at the time of purchasing and registering the product to use the information collected. Subscriptions on behalf of a student who is a minor,  must be completed by the student’s parent or legal guardian . 

*  Registrants who do not give this consent (or do not have this consent provided on their behalf) cannot provide us with their personal information and cannot use the Site. You can however withdraw your consent at any time.

How we collect and process your personal information
----------------------------------------------------

* We may collect your personal information in a number of ways, including:
    * directly from you (unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so);
    * from our school / educational institution customers (e.g. teachers or school administrators that purchase access to our Site for their students and teachers); or
    * from third parties such as our distributors (resellers and sales agents).
* Students registering individually and not part of a school, must give their consent at the time of registration to provide us with their personal information such as their name, age and email address (or if they are under 13 years of age, or legally a minor in their relevant location, a parent or guardian must consent on their behalf and provide the student’s personal information). Alternatively, parents registering on behalf of their child(ren), must give their consent at the time of registration to provide us with information about them and their child(ren). 
* Teachers or administrators registering for their class or school must give their consent at the time of registration to provide us with their own name, class name, school name and their email address, as well as the names of their students. 
* We also ask for Registrants’ consent to use any personal information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy at the time of login to our Site. If a Registrant does not wish to provide us with their consent, they cannot agree to the Site Terms and Conditions and must not use the Site.

What we will do with your information
-------------------------------------

* The information collected from Registrants, customers or prospective customers may be used for the following purposes
    * to provide access to our products and services;
    * to manage prospective purchases, purchased subscriptions and payments including to provide quotes or offers.
    * to send a confirmation notice to the Registrant of the registration; to administer and manage accounts, including password resetting, responding to questions raised by Registrants, to contact the Registrant about any problems with the Registrant’s account or conduct on the Site;
    * to receive updates about our products and services;
    * to send out a 3P Learning newsletter or emails about the Site including information about current events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new product development and rules of the Site;
    * to publish the names of winners and high performers on the Site or in the 3P Learning newsletter and to provide results data for each Registrant or school class;
    * to send prizes or certificates for participation and performance on the Site;
    * for administrative, planning, product or service development, staff training, quality control and research purposes relating to our products and services;
    * for marketing purposes, but only where we have express or implied consent to contact someone or we are otherwise permitted by law to do so. Registrants may also opt out at any time by following the specific opt out instructions within the communications that we send.
* Hall of Fame leaderboards: 3P Learning strives to provide a highly engaging Site for students. Given students have indicated their strong preference for their name to be shown publicly on our Sites in recognition of their achievements, we allow this – but we do not allow full names (i.e. First Name and Surname) to be shown publicly. In addition, all administrative user access to any Site permits the partial (to initials only) or full anonymising (by use of a pseudonym) of names, where preferred by the user. If you have any questions about the Hall of Fame and managing the information that is disclosed, please [contact us](mailto:privacy@3plearning.com).
* The Site does not provide students with any means to communicate directly with each other. There are no chat rooms connected with the learning resources. Access to, and use of customer feedback forums, such as 3P Learning Uservoice, is designed for use by parents, teachers and other contributors who are not legally minors.
* The Site may have additional features in which parents and teachers can give their consent, and/or give consent on behalf of a student, to access, disclose or use their personal information or learning activity information.  

What we will not do with your personal information
--------------------------------------------------

* 3P Learning will keep your personal information confidential and not sell or disclose your information to advertisers or any external third parties, unless:
    * we believe, in good faith, that we are required to share your information with a third party such as a regulator or court in order to comply with law, regulation, legal process, court order or subpoena; 
    * to enforce our Terms & Conditions or the terms of the licence granted to access and use the Site;
    * the disclosure is to a third party that acts on our behalf, powers certain aspects of our Sites or processes data on our behalf, such as a distributor of our products and services, the licensor or owner of a product or resource that we distribute, or to a contracted service provider;
    * in connection with any transaction involving our companies or assets, where another party acquires ownership or operation of the Site, in which case that successor organization will be subject to the obligations in this Privacy Policy and any contractual representations we have entered into; or
    * to protect the safety and security of our Registrants and our Site.
* If third parties act on our behalf, we require them to hold, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, applicable privacy obligations and our contractual obligations. 
* Generally we will only use your information within 3P Learning, however, sometimes we provide data on results to government education departments, peak bodies managing or representing schools, or schools themselves, especially in the case of School Customers, who use the features of our products (such as performance reporting tools) for educational / teaching purposes. We will require these third parties to comply strictly with our instructions, use the information only for legitimate educational interests and not for any commercial purposes. 
* We do not sell data to advertisers (whether personal, anonymous or aggregated). We do not use data to engage in targeted advertising to children and we do not create or build personal profiles of students other than for the purpose of supporting authorized educational/school purposes or as otherwise specifically authorized by a parent/student or school/educational institution customer. 
* We do not use cookies or third party providers to engage in behavioural targeting of advertisements to students. For more information refer to our Cookies & Third Party Technologies Policy.

---------------------------------

* We retain the personal information that we collect from and about our Registrants for as long as it is needed to provide access to the Site or to manage that Registrant’s account.
* We take reasonable steps to delete the personal information we collect if your registration to use our Site lapses and you (or if you are under 13 or legally a minor in your relevant location, a parent or guardian may request on your behalf) opt out of receiving further communications from us, or if you ask us to delete your information. We may however retain and use personal information as necessary to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes and to enforce our agreements, and we may retain and use anonymous and aggregated information for performance reporting, benchmarking and analytic purposes and for product and service improvement.
