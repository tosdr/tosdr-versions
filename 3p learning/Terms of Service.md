* The Site refers to any and all access to 3P Learning websites and resources, via static or mobile devices, in either native or mobile application format. Your access to and use of the Site (collectively, your Access) is conditional on your acceptance and compliance with the terms, conditions, notices and disclaimers contained or referred to on this page (General Conditions). Your Access to the Site constitutes your agreement to be bound by the General Conditions and that agreement may be enforced by us. If you do not agree with any of these General Conditions, you must cease using the Site.

In the case of students who are minors, permission must be sought by that student’s school or parent / guardian (as applicable) before that student is provided with Access to the Site.
* We reserve the right, at our discretion, to revise, amend and update the General Conditions at any time effective on the date of posting to the Site of the new and amended provisions.

User Generated Content
----------------------

* Certain Sites and products may allow registered users to submit content through, or post content on, the Site (User Generated Content or “UGC”). For example, audio recordings of phonemes within the Readiwriter Phonics product (where students repeat and record letter sounds within the product), or feedback about our products through our customer feedback forums, such as 3P Uservoice.
* If you make any UGC available through our Site, you give us permission to use, copy, modify, adapt, display and distribute that content for the purposes of (i) you and your teacher/school utilising a feature or function of the relevant product or Site; (ii) for administrative, planning, product improvement, quality control and academic or research purposes relating to our products and services, and/or (iii) otherwise in accordance with the restrictions outlined in these General Conditions and in accordance with our privacy policy. This permission is irrevocable and without payment or attribution. Unless otherwise specified, by making UGC available through the Site, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty free, sublicensable and transferable licence to use any such content in whole or in part. You are not giving up your ownership rights in your UGC, however, if you make UGC available through our Site or product, you do give us permission to use it in accordance with these General Conditions.
* Access to audio recordings by students for the purposes of (i) above, is restricted to the registered user/student that recorded the audio and their teacher/nominated school administrator, where access to the product has been purchased as part of a school subscription, and in all cases, only behind the product login. Parents may access stored recordings via their child’s login or with a parent login, when available.
* Your name and comments, suggestions and other feedback about our products, made through our feedback forums including 3P Learning Uservoice, may be viewed by other customers and users registered to participate in those feedback forums.

User Code of Conduct and Access  Rights
---------------------------------------

* Any user, including, students or teachers, found to be in breach of these General Conditions, acting in a manner that we deem to be inappropriate or inconsistent with the spirit of these General Conditions (e.g. submitting fraudulent results), or that is unlawful or prohibited by any laws applicable to the Site, may have their Access to the Site revoked.
* You must not access or use the Site or the Content in any manner or for any purpose which is illegal or prohibited by any laws that apply to you, violates our rights in any way, or is prohibited by the General Conditions.

We do not accept responsibility for any interference or damage to your own computer system or data, which arises in connection with your Access.
* The Site and our Content is continuously evolving. We reserve the right to delete, modify, change, evolve and improve existing Content, including curriculum, product features and tools, at any time without notice or consent.

* Reproducing resources in hard copy: Where copyright legislation in a location includes a remunerated scheme to permit educational institutions to photocopy or print any part of the Site, we (or the owner of the copyright material) will claim remuneration under that scheme where such resources (for example, but without limitation, our worksheets, workbooks or other resources that can be used in hardcopy format) are printed or photocopied by, or on behalf of, educational institutions (e.g. by teachers for use in the classroom or by students or where teachers direct students to print or photocopy worksheets for use by students at school). This may lead to an increase in the fees for educational institutions to participate in the relevant scheme.

* Our failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive our ability to act with respect to that circumstances or similar circumstances.
* However, if we expressly waive any rights available to us under these General Conditions on one occasion, this does not mean that those rights will automatically be waived on any other occasion.
* If any of the General Conditions are held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, the remaining terms and conditions will nevertheless continue in full force.

Cookies
-------

For information about the cookies we use, please refer to our  [cookies page](https://www.3plearning.com/cookie-policy/).

Challenges and Competitions
---------------------------

From time to time, we host or operate challenges and competitions within the Site, which may be supported by third party sponsors. Challenges are designed to encourage school and student participation in a fun and engaging online learning event. We are thrilled that so many students from around the world are participating in the variety of events we support, and encourage you all to continue to join in. These General Conditions, including the  [3P Learning Privacy Policy](https://www.3plearning.com/policies/privacy-policy/), govern challenges and competitions, in addition to any other terms and conditions in place specifically for the relevant challenge or competition.

The Hall of Fame or leaderboard for a challenge or competition does not determine the final result. After the event, we will verify all results. We have the right, at our complete discretion, to determine the final positions of all participants and the winners of all categories.

* Participants who do not comply with these General Conditions, may be removed from the Hall of Fame or disqualified from the competition at any time, and we will use our complete discretion as to whether or not removal or disqualification occurs.
* Students, classes and schools may be required by us to provide proof of age and to sign a declaration that they individually and collectively participated without assistance from any other person, software, hardware or device.
* Any students, classes or schools intentionally misusing the Site be disqualified or removed from the Hall of Fame of the competition or challenge at any time. Examples of misuse include but are not limited to computer hacking of the Site, posting fraudulent results, using computer scripts to improve responses, scores or otherwise.
* We may, at our complete discretion, remove from competition any students, classes and schools not participating in courses or on content appropriate for their age. Prizes advertised for a challenge or competition may be substituted, for something of equivalent value, as determined by us or the prize provider at our complete discretion.
