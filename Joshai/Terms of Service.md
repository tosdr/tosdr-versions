### TERMS OF SERVICE

General Terms of Service

This Agreement was last modified on October 5th, 2023

Welcome to the website and online service of Josh.ai, Inc. (“Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”). This page provides the terms by which you may access and use: (i) this website and any other website on which we post this Terms of Service Agreement; and (ii) our voice controlled home automation hardware product (“Josh”), our online and hosted services, and the software and hardware provided on or in connection with our services and/or Josh ((i) – (ii) collectively, the “Service”). By clicking “I Agree,” or the like indicating acceptance electronically, or by accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and you agree to be bound by this Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.josh.ai/privacy-policy), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service and whether or not you are a paid subscriber to our Service. Company reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service (“Users”).

**PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.**

Use of our Service

**Eligibility:** You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Company, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Company.  
  
**Company Service:** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company hereby grants you a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service. Company reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Company Content (as defined below). Company may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason. Company may subcontract any element of the Service in its sole discretion.  
  
**Company Accounts:** The Service may allow you to register an account, for instance by successfully completing a Josh purchase, by creating an account through our website, or when invited to a property by another User. Your Company account gives you access to the Service and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Company account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity under your account, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to Company with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.  
  
You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs during use of the Services through your account, including all guest and other user accounts under your Company account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Company immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Company will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.  
  
You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your account settings page. By providing Company your email address and physical address you consent to our using the email address and physical address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address and physical address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your account settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving physical mail and email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.  
  
**Service Rules:** You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Company servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Company grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from www.josh.ai for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.  
  
Accessing the audiovisual content available on the Service for any purpose or in any manner other than Streaming (as defined below) is expressly prohibited. “Streaming” means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the Service to a User’s device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be copied, stored, permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the User.  
  
We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.  
  
You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users, and for any acts or omissions of any third parties who use the Service through your Company account. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Company shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.

User Content

Some areas of the Service allow Users to provide or record content such as profile information, comments, questions, commands, and other content or information. Any and all content or materials (including without limitation personal data or information) a User submits, provides, records or otherwise makes available on or through any functionality of the Service and any information recorded by a User’s actions on the Service, but excluding any data derived by Company from the foregoing (which is owned by Company and may be used by Company for any purpose subject to the terms of this Agreement and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.josh.ai/privacy-policy)) is referred to herein as “User Content”. We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you. The User Content you create remains yours; however, by sharing User Content through the Service to other Users and other services and products you use with the Service, you agree to allow such other individuals, and other services and products you use with the Service, to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in accordance with your settings and this Agreement. Other individuals whom you permit to use the Service through your account, and other services and products you use through the Service may have access to data regarding your use of the Service, as well as your profile information, including your name, photo, and other personal information. Company has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.

You agree not to post, and shall be solely liable for, User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current; or (ix) violates any school or other applicable policy, including those related to cheating or ethics. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy. To the extent that your User Content contains music, you hereby represent that you are the owner of all the copyright rights, including without limitation the performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect to each and every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound recording contained in such User Content and have the power to grant the license granted below. Company reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Company believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.

For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.

In connection with User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:

You have written consent of each and every identifiable natural person who uses the Service through your account and who is included in your User Content, including with respect to the use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use.

Your User Content and Company’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.

Company may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.

To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.

Company takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of recording, sending, posting or publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you and other Users may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Company shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content.

IN ADDITION, COMPANY TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY RESPONSES OR OUTPUT GENERATED BY THE SERVICE IN RESPONSE TO QUERIES YOU MAKE TO THE SERVICE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH RESPONSES AND OUTPUT MAY BE INACCURATE, OBJECTIONABLE, INAPPROPRIATE OR OTHERWISE UNSUITED TO YOUR PURPOSE, AND YOU AGREE THAT COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS RESULTING FROM SUCH RESPONSES.

User Content License Grant

By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Company a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and Company’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels, improving the Service, and for such other purposes as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.josh.ai/privacy-policy). You also hereby grant each User of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under this Agreement.

Software

**Software.** We may make available software to access and use the Service via Josh or a mobile device (“Software”). To use the Software on your mobile device you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Software. Company does not warrant that the Software will be compatible with your mobile device. Company hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Software for one Company account on your Josh device and on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Software, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Software to any third party or use the Software to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Software, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Software, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Software; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Software. You acknowledge that Company may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Software that you are using on your Josh or mobile device.

Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license agreement, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Software or any copy thereof, and Company or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. Company reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement. If the Software is being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision applies. Use, duplication, or disclosure of the Software by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions set forth in this Agreement and as provided in DFARS 227.7202-1(a) and 227.7202-3(a) (1995), DFARS 252.227-7013(c)(1)(ii) (OCT 1988), FAR 12.212(a) (1995), FAR 52.227-19, or FAR 52.227-14 (ALT III), as applicable.

You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the iTunes-Sourced Software. In the event of any failure of the iTunes-Sourced Software to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the iTunes-Sourced Software to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the iTunes-Sourced Software, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by this Agreement and any law applicable to Company as provider of the software. You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the iTunes-Sourced Software or your possession and/or use of the iTunes-Sourced Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the iTunes-Sourced Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and all such claims are governed solely by this Agreement and any law applicable to Company as provider of the software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the iTunes-Sourced Software or your possession and use of that iTunes-Sourced Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Company, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement. You and Company acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your license of the iTunes-Sourced Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as relates to your license of the iTunes-Sourced Software against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

Our Proprietary Rights

Except for your User Content, the Service and all materials therein or transferred thereby, including, without limitation, Software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and User Content belonging to other Users (the “Company Content”), and all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of Company and its licensors (including other Users who post User Content to the Service). Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any Company Content. Use of the Company Content for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.

You may choose to, or we may invite you to, submit comments or ideas about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Ideas”). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Company under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Company does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Company, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.

Company Property

Certain aspects of the Service may allow you to obtain certain reputational or status indicators ("Company Property"). You understand and agree that regardless of terminology used, Company Property represents a limited license right governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and available for distribution at Company's sole discretion. Company Property is not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from Company at any time. You acknowledge that you do not own the account you use to access the Service, nor do you possess any rights of access or rights to data stored by or on behalf of Company on Company servers, including without limitation any data representing or embodying any or all of your Company Property. You agree that Company has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate Company Property as it sees fit in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that Company will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right. All data on Company's servers are subject to deletion, alteration or transfer. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY VALUE ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH DATA BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DATA, ACCOUNT HISTORY AND ACCOUNT CONTENT RESIDING ON COMPANY'S SERVERS, MAY BE DELETED, ALTERED, MOVED OR TRANSFERRED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND. COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE OR GUARANTEE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY VALUE, CASH OR OTHERWISE, ATTRIBUTED TO ANY DATA RESIDING ON COMPANY'S SERVERS.

Software Plans

**Josh.ai Software Plan.** Certain aspects of the Service may be provided for a fee or other charge. In particular, Users may subscribe to a **“Software Plan”** in connection with their purchase of a Josh device (such as Josh One™, Josh Micro™ or Josh Core™). If you purchase a Software Plan subscription, you are referred to here as a **“Customer”** (and, for clarity, you remain a “User” as defined above).

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Software Plan provides you and members of your household at one residential address (unlimited user profiles) with full access to the Service’s features on one respective Josh system. (For instance, one Software Plan may be attached to one Josh One, Josh Micro, or Josh Core at the same household), plus access to the Software, for as long as the Software Plan remains active. Software Plan Customers will only have access to the features and content available via the respective Josh device attached to the Software Plan (e.g., VoiceLink and multiple VLAN access are only available when using Josh Core).

**Software Plan Billing Cycles and Auto-Renewal.** Software Plans have a monthly \[or yearly\] term, and renew automatically on a monthly \[or yearly\] basis until canceled in accordance with this Agreement. Billing occurs at the beginning of the Software Plan cycle. By purchasing a Software Plan, you acknowledge that your Software Plan has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Software Plan by you or us. Your failure to terminate and/or continued use of your Software Plan reaffirms that we are authorized to charge you for that Software Plan. To change or terminate your Software Plan, go to your Josh.ai Account Settings in the Software, at [portal.josh.ai](https://portal.josh.ai/), or contact Support at [support@josh.ai](mailto:support@josh.ai).

**Software Plan Prepaid Periods.** You may be given the opportunity to prepay for a period of one or more months of your Software Plan. At the conclusion of a prepaid period, unless you cancel prior to renewal, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, your Software Plan will automatically continue on a month-to-month basis at the then-existing non-promotional price for your Software Plan.

**Other Software Plan Offers.** We may offer you additional promotions or discounts related to Software Plans from time to time. Please read the details of those offers carefully, as any additional terms presented to you during the registration process will form part of this Agreement. Unless we otherwise specify in writing, all discount offers that require a payment are non-refundable. Any free trial or other promotion must be used within the specified time frame of the trial or promotion. You may be required to have a valid payment method on file in order to initiate a free trial; in this case, if you do not cancel before your free trial period ends, your account will be converted to a paid Software Plan and will be charged in accordance with this Agreement.

**Your Termination of a Software Plan.** If you terminate your Software Plan, you may use your Software Plan until the end of the then-current period and your Software Plan will not be renewed after that period expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Software Plan fee paid for the then-current Software Plan period\[, subject to specific cancellation and refund rights listed below for certain Canadian residents\].

**Our Termination of a Software Plan.** We may immediately terminate all or a portion of your Software Plan, without notice if your payment is overdue (provided that we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the overdue payment before we terminate or suspend), or for any other basis this Agreement permits us to terminate your account, your access to the Service, or this Agreement.

In the event that we determine, in our sole discretion, that your Software Plan is being accessed in an unsupported setting or location, we reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Software Plan at any time by notifying you at the email address associated with your Software Plan.

If we terminate or suspend your Software Plan, your license to use any software or content provided in connection with the Software Plan is also terminated or suspended (as applicable). If your Software Plan is terminated, Company has the right to immediately delete all data, files, and other information stored in or for your account without further notice to you. You must pay all charges up to and including the date of termination. Should you wish to resume your Software Plan after any suspension, a restoration of service fee may apply. This fee is in addition to all past due unpaid charges and other fees.

Payments

**Billing Policies.** By your purchase or subscription, you agree to our pricing and payment terms, as we may update them from time to time; provided, however, that if the amount to be charged varies from the amount you originally authorized (other than due to applicable sales, VAT or similar taxes), we will provide notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before that scheduled date, unless applicable law requires you to expressly consent to the change in price. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle. Company may add new services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion. Any change to our pricing or payment terms shall become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in this Agreement. We use Stripe as our third party payment processor, and as a service provider for other payment services. By using our Service you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Services Agreement available at [https://stripe.com/us/legal](https://stripe.com/us/legal)

**Return Policies.** By using the Service, you agree to our Return Policy for products (“Return Policy”), as we may update it from time to time. Any change to our Return Policy shall become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in this Agreement.

**No Other Refunds.** You may cancel your Company account at any time; however, there are no refunds for cancellation, except as may be expressly permitted under the Return Policy or under this Agreement. In the event that Company suspends or terminates your account or this Agreement, you understand and agree that you shall receive no refund or exchange for any Company Property, any unused time on a subscription, any license or subscription fees for any portion of the Service, any content or data associated with your account, or for anything else.

**Risk of Loss.** All products purchased from or via the Service are transported and delivered to you by an independent carrier not affiliated with, or controlled by, Company. Title to products purchased on the Service, as well as the risk of loss for such products, passes to you when Company or our supplier delivers these items to the carrier.

**Payment Information.** All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You are responsible for keeping such information up-to-date and must provide changes promptly to your account page, which may be accessed in the Software or at [portal.josh.ai](https://portal.josh.ai/). You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) that you provide to us (including to our payment processor). You authorize the issuer of your selected payment method to pay any amounts described herein without requiring a signed receipt, and you agree that this Agreement shall be accepted as authorization to the issuer of the payment method to pay any amounts described herein, without requiring a signed receipt from you. You authorize us to continue to attempt to charge and/or place holds with respect to all sums described herein, or any portion thereof, to your payment method until such amounts are paid in full. You agree to provide updated payment information upon request and any time the information you previously provided is no longer valid.

If you provide a debit card number instead of a credit card number, you authorize all charges described herein to be applied to such debit card unless and until you provide a credit card number. YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD.

Company warrants to the original owner of a Josh device purchased and installed via our Services or an authorized Company dealer (the “Product”) that the Product will be free from manufacturing defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for the period of eighteen (18) months from the date of purchase (“Limited Warranty”). This Limited Warranty is only valid and enforceable in locations Products are sold. This Limited Warranty only applies to hardware components (and not any software elements) of Products, and this Limited Warranty does not apply to damage caused by normal wear and tear, accidents, misuse or failure to follow product documentation, neglect, disassembly, alterations, servicing other than by Company authorized technicians, and external causes such as, but not limited to, water damage, anomalies in the electrical current supplied to the device, and extreme thermal or environmental conditions. This Limited Warranty does not guarantee that use of the Products will be uninterrupted or error free. Nothing in this Limited Warranty will reduce or otherwise affect your statutory rights in relation to the Products.

If a defect arises and you return the Product during the eighteen-month Limited Warranty period, Company will, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by law, either repair your Product using new or refurbished parts, replace your Product with a new or refurbished Product functionally at least equivalent to yours, or accept the return of your Product in exchange for providing you a refund of the purchase price you originally paid for it. If Company repairs or replaces Products, the repaired or replaced Products will continue to be warranted solely for the remaining time of the original Limited Warranty period. All returned parts for which you have received a replacement will become the property of Company.

To make a claim under the Limited Warranty, please call our customer service department at during normal business hours 9 am to 5 pm PT, excluding New Year’s Eve and Day, Memorial Day, July 4, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and be ready to provide your name, contact information and the serial number on the Product, as well as a purchase receipt.

•     Replacement units will be new or like-new quality.

•     If you fail to return the defective Product within twenty (20) days of a replacement Product being shipped to you, you will be charged the then-current fee for such defective Product.

•     If Product is returned to Company for a refund within the Limited Warranty period, the Product must be shipped to the Company facility where it will either be restocked or inspected and tested to determine the validity of the refund claim. If Company determines the product is defective, it will refund the customer and retain ownership of the Product.

•     Company is not responsible for installation of replacement Products.

•     Separate “no trouble found” charges may apply for Product returned under the warranty for repair that is determined to be in good working order. Such costs are limited to shipping, handling, testing, and administrative expenses.

•     Company liability on any claim for damages arising out of or in connection with the manufacture, sale, installation, delivery, or use of the Product shall never exceed the purchase price of the Product.

•     Company is not responsible for any data lost as part of the warranty return process.

•     It is the authorized dealer’s responsibility to ensure that no confidential, proprietary, or personal information remains on the defective Product before returning to Company.

Warranty Exclusions:

•     This Limited Warranty does not cover the cost or damage of Product installation, removal, or reinstallation.

•     This Limited Warranty shall be the sole and exclusive remedy to the original purchaser. In no event shall Company be liable for incidental or consequential damage of any kind.

•     Company reserves the right to reject any Product that fails to meet any and all limitations of the Limited Warranty.

•     Product returned and damaged due to inadequate packaging will be considered void of the Limited Warranty.

•     The Limited Warranty will be voided if and when there is any Product misuse, which includes:

    o     Product or cosmetic defect due to accidental damage, dislodgement from a wall or surface, abuse, neglect, flood, fire, earthquake, or any act of god.

    o     Modifications to alter the functionality or capabilities of the Product without the knowledge or express written consent of Company.

Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver

**Governing Law.** You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Los Angeles County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Los Angeles County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

**Arbitration.** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM COMPANY. For any dispute with Company, you agree to first contact us at legal@josh.ai and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Company has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County, California, unless you and Company agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this "Arbitration" section shall be deemed as preventing Company from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.

**Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.** WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

General

If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

**Entire Agreement/Severability.** This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Company in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Company concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.

**No Waiver.** No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Company’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Sites of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254.
