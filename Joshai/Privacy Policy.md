Built for Privacy

At Josh, we believe that trust and responsibility help make a house a home. We understand the importance of protecting personal data, and we engineer our products to continuously enhance those protections.

Voice You Can Trust

Josh will never use client information for marketing purposes or sell user data to third parties. Unlike the mass-market voice assistants, Josh's sole focus is on providing the best smart home experience possible.  
  
A critical component of being a premium home OS is that the actions and words spoken behind closed doors stay there. We not only protect the privacy of our clients and their families, but continuously optimize how Josh secures the data it collects.

MICROPHONE PRIVACY

Josh is always ready to help, but only listens when it is woken up. Simply address and activate your Josh microphone with its wake word when you want to make a request. By default, the wake word to activate a Josh Micro and Josh Nano is “Ok Josh.” The wake word can also be changed to “Ok Home” or “Hey Micro.”

SECURE & TRANSPARENT ACCESS

Every property has different needs, and Josh provides clients with complete control over the access that each resident and guest has to their home's technology. All Josh clients are guided through an account set-up flow that enforces strict password requirements and user roles. Authentication is required by users when logging into the Josh App through their mobile phones and tablets.

ALWAYS IMPROVING

When AI Learning is enabled, Josh is always improving based on how clients are interacting with their smart homes. If AI learning is disabled, Josh will not be able to optimize a client’s experience based on his or her usage patterns or behaviors.

PROACTIVE PRIVACY SETTINGS

At Josh, we believe that our clients and their Home Technology Professionals should have complete control over their smart home’s privacy settings. Josh’s settings enable users to permanently delete their system’s Chat History at any point. However, erasing command transcripts may limit both Josh’s ability to learn as well as a Home Technology Professional’s ability to troubleshoot challenges in the event that support is necessary.

WAKE WORD DETECTION

Josh hardware is tuned to be at our clients' service when needed. There is balancing act to optimize the availablity of Josh, while minimizing accidentally waking the Josh device. Accidental wakes can be triggerd by phrases similar to the wake word, and selectinig an alternate wake phrase is a good option for our clients that commonly use names/phrases that are similar to the wake word.

Josh Core runs most processing locally, including natural language programming, logs, device discovery & more.

Josh prioritizes local processing whenever possible. When local processing is not an option, one of the following cloud services will be accessed through an encrypted connection.

System Availability

In the event that Josh falls offline due to a power or network outage, a cloud backup is available to quickly bring the system back online.

Speech Recognition

After Josh is woken up (by saying “Ok Josh”), it starts processing audio through encrypted cloud services. Once the audio is converted to text, Josh processes the command locally to complete the client’s request.

Expanded Services

When Josh is fulfilling a request for music, video, weather, news, etc., it leverages web service partners to access the most up-to-date entertainment and searchable information.

Cloud Devices

In limited cases, Josh controls third-party devices through an authenticated cloud connection.

LED Feedback

Users will always be able to tell when Josh’s listening because the LED dial on Josh Micro and Josh Nano will animate in a spinning rainbow animation. A pulsating rainbow animation means that Josh has finished listening to your request and is processing your command.

Muting Josh

For additional security, you can ensure that a Josh microphone does not accidentally activate by muting its microphones. By default, a single-tap of the capacitive touch dial of Josh Micro and Josh Nano performs a mute. Another single tap reactivates the microphones. When muted, Josh’s LED dial will display a red-orange light to signal the microphone is disabled.

PRIVACY BUILT-IN

Simply slide the privacy switch down and the microphones in Josh Nano are physically disconnected, providing peace of mind that nobody can be listening in.

ENTERPRISE GRADE ARCHITECTURE

Josh’s cloud is built on a secure, enterprise-grade platform that regularly performs audits and maintains PCI, HIPAA, ISO, and SOC compliance.

The Story Behind the Logo

Josh is a home’s best friend. And like a dog, Josh is intelligent, responsive, and learns his owner’s commands. While other smart home control systems only know one trick, Josh combines all aspects of smart homes into one friendly, well-trained responder. Josh is your companion, and always happy to see you come home.
