The Receiving Party's non-disclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (A) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (B) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (C) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (D) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have by law. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not operate as a separate warranty with respect to the operation of the Service.

-----------------------------

NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, COSTS OF DELAY OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.

The limitations under this "Limitation of Liability" section apply with respect to all legal theories, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, and to the extent permitted by applicable laws. The provisions of this "Limitation of Liability" section allocate the risks under this Contract between the parties, and the parties have relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter into this Contract and the pricing for the Service.

24\. IP Indemnification by Fibery.
----------------------------------

We will defend you against any claim brought against you by a third party alleging that a Service, when used as authorized under these Terms, infringes a third party intellectual property (a "Claim"), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to settlement by Fibery (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of a Claim, provided that we have received from you: (A) prompt written notice of the claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice); (B) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation of the claim, including providing us a copy of the claim and all relevant evidence in your possession, custody or control; and (C) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the claim. If your use of a Service is (or in our opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement, or if we determine such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, we may, at our option and in our discretion: (I) procure a license for your continued use of the Service in accordance with these Terms; (II) substitute a substantially functionally similar Service; or (III) terminate your right to continue using the Service and refund any prepaid amounts for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term. Fibery indemnification obligations above do not apply: (1) if the total aggregate fees received by Fibery with respect to your subscription to Service in the 12 month period immediately preceding the claim is less than US $50,000; (2) if the Service is modified by any party other than Fibery without Fibery's permission, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (3) if the Service is used in combination with any non-Fibery product not provided for in the Documentation, software or equipment, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to unauthorized use of Service; (5) to any Claim arising as a result of (M) Your Data (or circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations in Section 8.2 (Indemnity for Your Data)) or (N) any third-party deliverables or components contained with the Service; (5) to any unsupported release of the Software; or (6) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to a claim without Fibery's prior written consent. THIS SECTION 23 (IP INDEMNIFICATION BY Fibery) STATES OUR SOLE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SERVICE OR OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED BY Fibery UNDER THESE TERMS.

25\. Third Party Products and Services.
---------------------------------------

Fibery or third parties may from time to time make available to you third-party products or services, including but not limited to Connectors and Add-ons as well as implementation, customization, training, and other consulting services. If you procure any of these third-party products or services, you do so under a separate agreement (and exchange of data) solely between you and the third party vendor. Fibery does not warrant or support non-Fibery products or services, whether or not they are designated by Fibery as "verified" or otherwise and disclaims all liability for such products or services. If you install or enable any third-party products or services for use with Fibery products, you acknowledge that the vendors of those products and services may access Your Data as required for the interoperation and support of such Add-ons with the Fibery Service. Fibery shall not be responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Your Data resulting from any such access by third-party add-on vendors.

26\. Publicity Rights.
----------------------

We may identify you as an Fibery customer in our promotional materials only after receiving immediate approval from an authorized representative. You may request that we stop identifying you by contacting the Support or Sales departments at any time. Please note that it may take us up to 5 days to process your request.

27\. Dispute Resolution.
------------------------

### 27.1 Arbitration.

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do not reach a settlement within a period of 60 days, any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall proceed to binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The parties shall seek to mutually appoint an arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then there shall be three (3) arbitrators: one selected by each party, and a third selected by the first two. Arbitration will take place in one of the following cities as mutually agreed upon between the parties: Nicosia (Cyprus) or Buffalo, NY (USA). If the parties are unable to agree to one of these cities, then the arbitration shall proceed in Nicosia, Cyprus. All negotiations and arbitration proceedings pursuant to this Section will be confidential and treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of all similar rules and codes of evidence of applicable legislation and jurisdictions. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

### 27.2 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of the Cyprus, without giving effect to the principles of that State relating to conflicts of laws. Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit or proceeding that is not otherwise subject to the arbitration provisions of Section 27.1 (Dispute Resolution; Arbitration) must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of the courts of Cyprus, and each party irrevocably submits to the sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts of Cyprus, generally and unconditionally, with respect to any action, suit or proceeding brought by it or against it by the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Fibery may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.

### 27.3 Injunctive Relief; Enforcement.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 27.1 (Dispute Resolution; Arbitration), nothing in these Terms shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations or enforcement or recognition of any award or order in any appropriate jurisdiction.

28\. Changes to these Terms.
----------------------------

We may update or modify these Terms from time to time, including any referenced policies and other documents. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (for example, by sending an email to email address you've specified when registering account, posting on our blog or through your Fibery Service Instance). If we modify the Terms during your Subscription Term, the modified version will be effective upon your next renewal of Subscription Term, as applicable. In this case, if you object to the updated Terms, as your exclusive remedy, you may choose not to renew, including cancelling any terms set to auto-renew. With respect to Free service, accepting the updated Terms is mandatory for you to continue using the Service. You may be required to click through the updated Terms to show your acceptance. If you do not agree to the updated Terms after it becomes effective, you will no longer have a right to use Free service. For the avoidance of doubt, any Order is subject to the version of the Terms Agreement in effect at the time of the Order.
