Cookies Policy




====================

This policy provides information about how and when we use cookies and their associated data.

General information
-------------------

This policy provides information about how and when we use cookies and their associated data. It applies to Fibery Service and Websites. Additinal information about our collection and use of your Data is available in our [Privacy Policy](https://fibery.io/privacy-policy). Fibery strives to minimize the amount of cookies used and information collected to ensure Users privacy and best Service performance.

### What is a cookie?

Cookies are small text files sent by websites to your computer or mobile device that enable services and website features to function properly. Cookies are unique to your Fibery account and to your browser. Session-based cookies only last while your browser is open, and are automatically deleted when you close the browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.

To find out more about cookies in general, visit [this site](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

### Does Fibery use cookies?

Yes. Fibery uses cookies and may use similar technologies, such as single-pixel GIFs and web beacons, in the future. We use both session-based and persistent cookies. Fibery sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by Fibery and its corporate affiliates (collectively, the “**Sites**”). Additionally, for our Website and Service, we use third party cookies, such as Google Analytics.

### How is Fibery using cookies?

Some cookies are associated with your account information so that your browser can remember if you are logged in, and which Service Instance you are logged in to. Other cookies are not tied to your account, but are unique and allow us to carry out analytics and customization.

Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit a website or use our Services, to remember your preferences, and to give you a personalized experience that’s consistent with your preferred settings. Cookies also make your interactions faster and more secure. Please check the cookies table at the end of this document to learn more.

| Categories of Use | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication | If you're signed in to our Services, cookies help us to identify you and display the correct information. |
| Security | We use cookies to enable and support our security features. |
| Marketing | We may use cookies to help us deliver marketing campaigns and track their performance (e.g., a user visiting our Guide). Similarly, our partners may use cookies to provide us with information about your interactions with their services, but use of those third-party cookies would be subject to the service provider’s policies. |
| Performance, Analytics and Research | Cookies help us learn how well our Sites and Services perform. We may also use cookies to understand, improve, and analyze the usage of products, features, and services, including the creation of logs and records when you access our websites and Services from different devices. |

### What third-party cookies does Fibery use?

You can find a list of third-party cookies that Fibery uses on our Websites and Service, along with some additional information in the cookies table at the end of this document. While we do our best to keep this table updated, please note that the number and names of cookies, pixels, and other technologies may change from time to time, and there may be a slight delay updating the table.

#### What can you do if you don't want cookies to be set, want them to be removed, or if you want to opt out of analytics?

Some people prefer not to allow cookies or to only allow certain cookies, which is why most browsers give you the ability to manage cookie settings to suit you. In some browsers, you can set up rules to manage cookies on a site by site basis, giving you more granular control over your privacy. This means that you can disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust, or to only allow first-party cookies from the sites you visit. Also there's a way to directly disable analytics cookies such as Google Analytics, see Cookies Table below for the detailed information.

Browser manufacturers provide help pages related to cookie management in their products. Please see below for more information.

* [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-GB)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer)
* [Safari (Desktop)](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH5042?locale=en_US)
* [Safari (Mobile)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)

* [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/260971)

For other browsers, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.

You can opt out of interest-based targeting provided by participating ad servers through the Digital Advertising Alliance ([http://youradchoices.com](http://youradchoices.com/)). In addition, on your iPhone, iPad or Android device, you can change your device’s Privacy settings to control whether you see online interest-based ads.

If you limit the ability of websites and applications to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience and/or lose the ability to access services, because your browser will no longer be personalized to you. This may also prevent you from saving customized settings, such as login information.

### Does Fibery respond to Do Not Track Signals?

We only use required cookies such as the one used for authentication, therefore, we do not alter our cookes processing upon receipt of such a signal. Third-party services that we use in some cases will act in accordance with their own policies, and will typically respond to DNT signals.
