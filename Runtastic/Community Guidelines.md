COMMUNITY GUIDELINES
====================

The adidas Runtastic community is a global fitness family united by a passion for sports. Sports are only fun when we all play by a common set of rules. We’d like to make sure the rules of the game are clearly outlined so that every user feels that we’re on the same team. Below you’ll find our Community Guidelines with more information about what we expect from our members and what you can expect from us.

### RESPECT OTHERS

Every user is a valued member of the adidas Runtastic community and should be treated as such. Please remember to be kind and respectful when posting on our platforms. As the old saying goes, if you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say anything at all. Respecting all the members of the community, regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation also means refraining from posting images or texts that depict or reference violence, nudity, sexual and/or offensive content. Likewise, unauthorized commercial advertising, or any use of “bots” or automated updates from unapproved partners is strictly prohibited. If such content is posted, it will be removed and further violations of this rule may result in the removal of the user. Also, misusing adidas Runtastic platforms or app functions to spam users is prohibited and will result in account deletion.

### PUT HEALTH FIRST

Encouraging a healthy and active lifestyle is our top priority. Just as we are advocates of it, we expect members of our community to promote safe and healthy habits. An open discussion which raises awareness of issues such as body image, eating habits, etc. in a respectful way is both accepted and encouraged. However, texts or images which promote or glamorize dangerous dieting techniques, eating disorders or non-medically prescribed supplements/procedures will not be tolerated and will be removed from our platforms.

### PLAY FAIR

Friendly competition can be a great motivator and there are plenty of ways to compete with other users in the adidas Runtastic apps — but activities/content that raise flags about suspected cheating (think: superhuman pace, unrealistic activity duration, etc.) will be investigated and may be removed. If we see persistent cheating, we may remove the user from the app, but let's hope that never happens. Also please make sure you provide accurate information about yourself when registering in the apps — you can find more information about this topic in our Terms & Conditions.

### KEEP IT LEGAL

We encourage all members of the community to motivate each other by creating their own unique and original content and sharing it in the adidas Runtastic apps and on our social platforms. Please make sure you have the rights to share any images or music you use in the content you share. Please note you may face legal action for distribution of content which you are not authorized to use.

### SPEAK UP

As a member of the community, you are encouraged to take action directly in the app if you suspect these guidelines are being violated. If you wish to report a user for violating the guidelines above, you can do so by visiting their profile and clicking “Report User” or [contacting our Customer Happiness Team.](https://help.runtastic.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011906540-Report-Spam-and-Harmful-Content)

Your choice to report the user will not be communicated to said user, but will be seen only by adidas Runtastic. We will investigate your report and choose a course of action. Understand that we cannot guarantee that all users will follow these guidelines, but together we can do our best to keep the adidas Runtastic community healthy and safe.

  

Please note these guidelines are subject to change and we will update them regularly based on the needs of the community. These guidelines exist alongside our Terms & Conditions, which can be found [here.](https://www.runtastic.com/terms)
