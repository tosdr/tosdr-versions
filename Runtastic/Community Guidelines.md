Community Guidelines
====================

The adidas Running community is a global fitness family united by a passion for sports. Sports are only fun when we all play by a common set of rules. We’d like to make sure the rules of the game are clearly outlined so that every user feels that we’re on the same team. Below, you’ll find our Community Guidelines with more information about what we expect from our members and what you can expect from us.

### **RESPECT OTHERS**

Every user is a valued member of the adidas Running community and should be treated as such. Please remember to be kind and respectful when posting on our platforms. As the old saying goes, if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all. Respecting all members of the community also means refraining from posting images or text that depicts or references offensive content. Likewise, unauthorized commercial advertising, or any use of “bots” or automated updates from unapproved partners is strictly prohibited. If such content is posted, it will be removed and further violations of this rule may result in the removal of the user. Also, misusing adidas Running platforms or app functions to spam users is prohibited and will result in account deletion.

**Some examples include, but are not limited to:**  
**Bullying, Intimidation, and Degrading Content:** No bullying, harassment, or unwanted contact. This includes repeated, sexual, mass contact, and harassment based on age, gender, race, or sexual orientation. No degrading content about bodily functions, celebrating death or medical conditions, or dehumanizing comparisons.

**Harmful Statements and Threats:** No calls for self-harm or suicide, threats to release personal data, or physical harm.

**Sexual and Derogatory Content:** No attacks based on sexual experiences, severe sexualized commentary, or derogatory sexualized images and terms.

**Denial and False Claims:** No denying violent tragedies, or making false claims about victims of such events.

**Discrimination and Exclusion:** No negative claims or content promoting exclusion based on physical appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity, or vaccination status.

**Human Exploitation:** No content facilitating or promoting human trafficking, child sales, illegal adoptions, or labor exploitation.

### **PUT HEALTH FIRST**

Encouraging a healthy and active lifestyle for everyone is our top priority. Just as we are advocates of it, we expect members of our community to promote safe and healthy habits. An open discussion which raises awareness of issues such as body image, eating habits, etc. in a respectful way is accepted. However, text or images which promote or glamorize dangerous techniques will not be tolerated and will be removed from our platforms.  
**Some examples of prohibited content:**  
**Self-Harm and Suicide:** No content promoting or depicting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Non-graphic recovery content is allowed.

**Sensitive Health Content:** No ridicule of victims of these issues or real-time portrayals of self-harm.

### **PLAY FAIR**

Friendly and fair competition can be a great motivator and there are plenty of ways to compete with other users in the adidas Running app - but activities/content that raise flags about suspected cheating will be investigated and may be removed. If we see persistent cheating, we may remove the user from the app, but let's hope that never happens. Also, please ensure you provide accurate information about yourself when registering in the apps - you can find more information about this topic in our Terms & Conditions.  
**Some examples:**  
**Cheating:** No cheating in Challenges, no cheating in Virtual Races, no mining adiClub points (e.g. superhuman pace, unrealistic activity duration, etc.).  
  
**False information:** No false information about yourself should be provided when registering in the app (e.g. False name, wrong age, stolen images, etc).

### **KEEP IT LEGAL**

We encourage all members of the community to motivate each other by creating their own unique and original content and sharing it in the adidas Running app and on social platforms. Please make sure you have the rights to share any images or music you use in the content you share. Please note, you may face legal action for distribution of content which you are not authorized to use.  
**Some examples of prohibited content include:**  
**Spam/Scam Policies:** No high-frequency posting/spamming, false engagement promises, deceptive URLs, or fraudulent activities.

**Violence:** No threats, depictions of violence, or solicitation of violent services. No encouragement of bringing weapons to sensitive locations.

**Hate Speech and Terrorism:** No support or representation of terrorist attacks, hate events, or related perpetrators. No glorification of violent ideologies or organizations.

**Weapons:** No content showing or sharing prohibited weapons.

**Adult Sexual Content:** No sexual imagery, secret sexualized imagery, or exploitation attempts. No threats to share private sexual conversations, or mocking of non-consensual sexual touching.

**Child sexual exploitation:** No content, activity or interactions that threaten, depict, praise, support, provide instructions for, make statements of intent, admit participation in, or share links of the sexual exploitation of children (including real minors, toddlers or babies, or non-real depictions with a human likeness - such as in art, AI-generated content, fictional characters, dolls, etc).

### **SPEAK UP**

As a member of the community, you are encouraged to take action directly in the app if you suspect these guidelines are being violated. If you wish to report a user for violating the guidelines above, you can do so by visiting their profile and clicking “Report User” or [contacting our Customer Happiness Team.](https://help.runtastic.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011906540-Report-Spam-and-Harmful-Content)  
Your choice to report the user will not be communicated to the affected user, and will only be seen by adidas Running. We will investigate your report and choose a course of action. Please understand that we cannot guarantee all users will follow these guidelines, but together we can do our best to keep the adidas Running community healthy and safe.  
Please note these guidelines are subject to change and we will update them regularly based on the needs of the community. These guidelines exist alongside our Terms & Conditions, which can be found [here.](https://www.runtastic.com/terms/adiclub)
