1\. Overview

BestProxyAndVPN.com has developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we may collect, retain, process, share and transfer your Personal Data when you visit our Sites or use our Services. This Privacy Policy applies to your Personal Data when you visit Sites or use Services, and does not apply to online websites or services that we do not own or control.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy does not constitute a “framework contract” for the purpose of the EU Payment Services Directive (2007/64/EC) or any implementation of that Directive in the European Economic Area.

This Privacy Policy is designed to help you obtain information about our privacy practices and to help you understand your privacy choices when you use our Sites and Services. Please note that our Service offerings may vary by region. This Privacy Policy may be supplemented with additional notices depending on the Sites and Services concerned. Supplementary information on Cookies and Tracking Technologies can be found in the Service Terms.

We have defined some terms that we use throughout the Privacy Policy. You can find the meaning of a capitalised term in the Definitions section.

Please contact us if you have questions about our privacy practices that are not addressed in this Privacy Policy.

2\. What Personal Data Do We Collect?

We collect Personal Data about you when you visit our Sites or use our Services, including the following:

* Other information we collect related to your use of our Sites or Services – We may collect additional information from or about you when you communicate with us, contact our customer support teams or respond to a survey.

3\. Why Do We Retain Personal Data?

We may retain Personal Data for longer periods than required by law if it is in our legitimate business interests and not prohibited by law. If your Account is closed, we may take steps to mask Personal Data and other information, but we reserve our ability to retain and access the data for so long as required to comply with applicable laws. We will continue to use and disclose such Personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The cookies we use have defined expiration times; unless you visit our Sites or use our Services within that time, the cookies are automatically disabled and retained data is deleted. Please consult our Service Terms for more information.

5\. Do We Share Personal Data?

We may share your Personal Data or other information about you with others in a variety of ways as described in this section of the Privacy Policy. We may share your Personal Data or other information for the following reasons:

* With other companies that provide services to us: We share Personal Data with third-party service providers that perform services and functions at our direction and on our behalf. These third-party service providers may, for example, provide you with Services, verify your identity, assist in processing transactions, send you advertisements for our products and services, or provide customer support.

    * to support our audit, compliance, and corporate governance functions.

6\. How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?

A significant benefit and innovation of BestProxyAndVPN.com’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorise or enable between your Account and a non-BestProxyAndVPN.com account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own. When you authorise such a connection, BestProxyAndVPN.com and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly. Examples of account connections include using your third party Account to make payments to BestProxyAndVPN.com or allowing a BestProxyAndVPN.com to charge your third party Account.

If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service. For example, if you connect your Account to a Paypal account, we will receive Personal Data from Paypal via the account connection. We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices. Before authorising an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that you authorised to have an account connection that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection. For example, Personal Data that BestProxyAndVPN.com shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.

7\. International transfers

Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers.

The parties mentioned above may be established in jurisdictions other than your own and outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland. These countries do not always afford an equivalent level of privacy protection. We have taken specific steps, in accordance with EEA data protection law, to protect your Personal Data. Please contact us for more information about this.

If you choose to use our service on infrastructure outside the EEA or Switzerland or connect our Service with platforms outside the EEA or Switzerland, we are required to transfer your Personal Data with those parties in order to provide the requested Service to you.

8\. How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?

When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognise you as a User and to customise your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising; measure the effectiveness of promotions and perform analytics; and to mitigate risk, prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Sites and Services. Certain aspects and features of our Services and Sites are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you choose to disable or decline Cookies, your use of the Sites and Services may be limited or not possible.

Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. We do not respond to DNT signals.

Please review our Service Terms to learn more about how we use Cookies.

9\. What Privacy Choices Are Available To You?

You have choices when it comes to the privacy practices and communications described in this Privacy Policy. Many of your choices may be explained at the time you sign up for or use a Service or in the context of your use of a Site. You may be provided with instructions and prompts within the experiences as you navigate the Services.

* Choices Relating to Our Use of Your Personal Data
    * Online Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising. We work with partners and third-party service providers to serve you advertising using ad-related cookies and web beacons. You can opt-out of third-party advertising-related cookies and web beacons, in which case our advertising should not be targeted to you. You will continue to see our advertising on third party websites. For more information on third-party advertising-related cookies and interest-based advertising, and to learn how to opt-out of these practices with companies participating in industry self-regulation, please visit [Your Online Choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).
* Choices Relating to Account Connections
    * If you authorise an account connection to a third-party account or platform, you may be able to manage your connection preferences from your Account or the third-party account or platform. Please refer to the privacy notice that governs the third-party platform for more information on the choices you may have.
* Choices Relating to Cookies
    * You may have options available to manage your cookies preferences. For example, your browser or internet device may allow you delete, disable, or block certain cookies and other tracking technologies. You can learn more by visiting AboutCookies.org. You may choose to enable these options, but doing so may prevent you from using many of the core features and functions available on a Service or Site.
    * You may have an option regarding the use of cookies and other tracking technologies when you use a Service or visit parts of a Site. For example, you may be asked if you want the Service or Site to “remember” certain things about you, and we will use cookies and other tracking technologies to the extent that you permit them.
