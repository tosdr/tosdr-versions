Disclosure of Personal Information
----------------------------------

Since our goal is to help you discover great content and services, the principal sharing of your information is to enhance your experience on the Platform. This section describes how and why we share information with Affiliates, service providers and partners for certain purposes, like consensual direct marketing and legal reasons.

1. With our Affiliates

As noted above, we may exchange, link or pool user information among Affiliates, but always in accordance with applicable law, applicable agreements and this Policy.

3. Direct marketing

Only if you opt-in, and only until you opt-out, we may share Account Data about you with third party sponsors or partners, including for their marketing communications. In any event, text messaging originator opt-in data and consent will not be shared with any third parties besides our SMS messaging service provider, Klaviyo.

5. Functional sharing

In addition to the use of trackers described in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.barstoolsports.com/cookie-policy), we contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services related to the functionality and features of the Platform, including payment processing, email and hosting services, software development, food ordering/delivery, shipping and fulfillment, data management, surveys and marketing, and administration of contests and other promotions. We call them **“Service Providers.”**

We may share information about you, as well as Usage Data and Device Information, with Service Providers as appropriate for them to perform their services for us and our Service Providers are permitted to use your information only for such purposes. In the past twelve (12) months, we have disclosed these types of information to the following types of Service Providers:

* Analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, to tell us how the Platform is doing, such as which parts interest visitors and how long they visit before leaving. Among other data, they may receive your IP address.
  
* Various hosting services and data processors to provide the infrastructure of the Platform, such as Cloudflare, which ensures that traffic is from real people, not computers. Among other data, they may receive your IP address.
  
* Payment providers, namely PayPal and ShopPay, to process payments between you and us, such as for subscriptions or products. These providers receive information about your order in order to tie your payment process to your order. We don’t receive all of the information you may provide to them as part of that process (for instance, we don’t receive full payment-account numbers).
  
* Delivery and fulfillment providers, namely Shopify, to fulfill your orders placed on the Barstool Sports Store and other Platforms. These providers receive information about you that is relevant and necessary to fulfill your order, such as delivery information.
  
* SMS messaging platform and delivery providers, such as Klaviyo and the phone companies who assist us in the delivery of text messages, to deliver text messages to you in connection with Platform marketing campaigns that you have opted in to receive. For additional info regarding SMS data, please see our [Messaging Terms](https://www.barstoolsports.com/messaging-terms).

  
10. With your consent or at your request

We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information. We also disclose information in response to your requests, such as to associate your account with your Social Network account.

12. For personalized ads

We share information with advertising partners to make the advertising presented to you more relevant to you. In the past twelve months, we have shared these categories of personal information with third parties to personalize advertising:

* Device Information
* Commercial Information
* Internet Activity

  
16. Technical

Finally, we may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that does not identify you, such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data and imprecise geolocation in de-identified and/or encrypted form) under any of the above circumstances. We may also share this information with our Affiliates and other third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources. To learn more, see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.barstoolsports.com/cookie-policy).

18. For legal compliance

Finally, we may share personal information: (i) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us; (ii) when we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our Terms of Use and other agreements; or (iii) in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

  

Retention of Personal Information
---------------------------------

We retain your information only as long as we need it for the purposes described under ["How We Use Personal Information,"](https://www.barstoolsports.com/privacy-policy#how-we-use) except when longer retention is required by our compliance policies and efforts toward applicable legal, tax, accounting and regulatory requirements.

How long we need information for those purposes varies by category, and even within categories. These retention determinations always consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from its unauthorized use or disclosure, whether we can achieve those purposes without using the personal information.

For example, we delete some Internet Activity as soon as you exit the Platform, whereas we may retain records of your orders for services and products for several years as required by law or contract, such as agreements with our payment processors or under our accounting standards.

Please understand, however, that we reserve the right to retain an archive of any deleted information, to the extent permitted by law. We may also retain de-identified or aggregate data that may be derived from information about you.

_This section applies to you only if you reside in a jurisdiction where GDPR applies._  
  

For GDPR purposes, the data controller is Barstool Sports, Inc., 333 7th Avenue, Floors 2-3, New York, NY 10001. Parties to which we disclose personal data are data processors to us or co-controllers with us.

See ["How We Use Personal Information"](https://www.barstoolsports.com/privacy-policy#how-we-use) section to review the legal basis for our collecting and processing of personal data under GDPR. Depending on your jurisdiction’s enactment of GDPR, you may have these rights:

* access – request copies of your personal data.
* rectification – request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete any information you believe is incomplete.
* erasure – request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.
* restrict processing – request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
* object to processing – object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
* data portability – request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.

You may contact us to exercise any of these rights. If you do not provide personal data to us or withdraw consent for processing personal data, we may not be able to provide you with certain aspects of the Platform.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

  

International Data Transfers
----------------------------

If you reside outside the United States, we transfer information about you for processing in the United States. By providing information about you to enable Platform services, you consent to the processing of such data in the United States. The transfer of this information to the United States is necessary for the performance of our contract for use of the Platform.

As the U.S. has not been deemed an “adequate” jurisdiction under GDPR for the purposes of international data transfers, we use Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU for transfers of personal data internationally, or another appropriate transfer mechanism.

  

U.S. State Rights
-----------------

_Some U.S. states provide residents with additional privacy rights and controls. If you reside in one of those states, you may be entitled to exercise certain rights with respect to your personal information, as described below, and subject to exceptions defined by law. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described under ["How to Contact Us"](https://www.barstoolsports.com/privacy-policy#contact) below._

* **Confirm Processing and Access your Personal Information:** You may request access and confirm processing of your personal information once in a calendar year. You may have the right to know what personal information the business has collected about you, including the categories of personal information, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing it, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it. Subject to exceptions, you may obtain a copy of your personal information we collected during the preceding twelve (12) months of your request, in a readily useable format where processing is done via automated means.
    
* **Deletion:** Subject to certain exceptions, you may request deletion of your personal information in our control. Please note that exercise of this right may render the Service, or parts of the Service, inaccessible or otherwise not function properly.
    
* **Correct Inaccuracies in your Personal Information:** You can also update or correct your account information and electronic message preferences at any time by logging in to your account and changing your profile settings.
    
* **Opt-out of Sale and Sharing for Targeted Advertising:** We do not sell your personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration. However, you may request opt-out of having your personal information processed for purposes of targeted advertising by visiting the NAI Opt-Out Page:[http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices). Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you are browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.
    
    The Platform automatically detects whether you are visiting from a state where this right applies. If you do, to opt out of the ‘sharing’ or sale of your information, please click or tap the ‘Do Not Sell My Info’ link on our homepage.
    
* **Universal Opt-Out Mechanism (California, Connecticut and Colorado Residents Only):** These browser- or device-level controls, such as “Global Privacy Control” (GPC) signals, automatically transmit a request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising. Currently our systems are unable to receive and honor these signals. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, please follow the above-noted steps.
    
* **Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information (California and Utah Residents Only):** You may limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to purposes necessary to provide you with the Platform services you request. The only sensitive personal information we collect is your precise location, if you have consented to provide it to us when prompted (like when you order a food delivery).
    
    You don’t need to exercise this right: we only use and disclose sensitive personal information as necessary to fulfill the service you requested (like sending the precise location you gave us to a food delivery service so it’s at least lukewarm on arrival).
    
* **Designate Authorized Agent:** You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to submit a request through an authorized agent.
    

1. Opt-Out of Communications

As described above, we may use the information we collect from you to send you newsletters, push notifications, general communications and promotional e-mails, including promotional communications about our Platform and our or our partners’ products or services. If you do not want to receive such communications, you can opt out (as applicable) by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our communications, unchecking the applicable box to opt out when prompted, or by simply not opting in when prompted. You may also at any time opt out of receiving communications from us by emailing privacy@barstoolsports.com with the subject line “Opt Out”.

If you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will still send you important information related to your account and your purchases. For example, if you unsubscribe from our promotional emails, we will still send you emails confirming a purchase you make on our Platform or alerting you to changes to our Terms of Use or this Policy.

  

Use by Minors
-------------

The Platform is intended for users above the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 16, and we do not share or sell information about anyone under 16 without affirmative authorization. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under 16 and you believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us.

  

How to Contact Us

If we cannot verify the identity of the individual making the request, we may deny it, in full or in part.
