You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of the content on our Services.
* We make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that any GTC Content (including User Content) is accurate, complete or up to date. Where our Services contain links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your information only. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources. Such links should not be interpreted as approval by us of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to pre-screen, monitor, review, or edit any content posted by you (including User Content).

User-Generated Content

* Users of the Services may be permitted to upload, post or transmit (such as via a stream) or otherwise make available content through the Services including, without limitation, any text, photographs, user videos, sound recordings and the musical works embodied therein, including videos that incorporate locally stored sound recordings from your personal music library and ambient noise (“**User Content**”). Users of the Services may also extract all or any portion of User Content created by another user to produce additional User Content, including collaborative User Content with other users, that combine and intersperse User Content generated by more than one user. Users of the Services may also overlay music, visual content, video, filters, graphics, stickers, Virtual Items (defined in the “[Platform Specific Terms](https://www.getcontact.com/terms-premium-content)”) and other elements provided by Getcontact (“**GTC Elements**”) onto this User Content and transmit this User Content through the Services. The information and materials in the User Content, including User Content that includes GTC Elements, have not been verified or approved by us. The views expressed by other users on the Services do not represent our views or values.
* Whenever you access or use a feature that allows you to share or transmit User Content through the Services (including via certain third party social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter), or to make contact with other users of the Services, you must comply with the necessary standards  and Terms of third parties. You may also choose to share or transmit your User Content, including User Content that includes GTC Elements, on sites or platforms hosted by third parties. If you decide to do this, you must comply with their content guidelines as well as with the standard.
* You warrant that any such contribution does comply with those standards, and you will be liable to us and indemnify us for any breach of that warranty. This means you will be responsible for any loss or damage we suffer as a result of your breach of warranty.
* Any User Content will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. You must not post any User Content on or through the Services or transmit to us any User Content that you consider to be confidential or proprietary. When you submit User Content through the Services, you agree and represent that you own that User Content, or you have received all necessary permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services, to transmit it from the Services to other third party platforms, and/or adopt any third party content.
* If you only own the rights in and to a content, but not to the underlying works embodied in such content, then you must not post such content to the Services unless you have all permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services .
* You or the owner of your User Content still own the copyright in User Content sent to us, but by submitting User Content via the Services, you hereby grant us an unconditional irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable, perpetual worldwide licence to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit, and/or distribute and to authorise others users of the Services and other third-parties to view, access, use, download, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit your User Content in any format and on any platform, either now known or hereinafter invented.
* You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your user name, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your User Content.
* For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the preceding paragraphs of this Section include, but are not limited to, the right to reproducing of content (and make mechanical reproductions of the content embodied in such sound recordings and images), and publicly perform and communicate to the content (and the musical works and images embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting us the right to Use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party.

**Through-To-The-Audience Rights.**All of the rights you grant in your User Content in these Terms are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of third party services will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content posted or used on such third party service via the Services.

**Waiver of Rights to User Content.** By posting User Content to or through the Services, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or with respect to any User Content you Post to or through the Services.

In certain circumstances, we also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Content posted or uploaded by you to our Services constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy, and such disclosure will be pursuant to a legally binding court order.

We, or authorised third parties, reserve the right to cut, crop, edit or refuse to publish, your content at our or their sole discretion. We have the right to remove, disallow, block or delete any posting and live-stream you make if, in our opinion, your post, channel or account does not comply with the community guidelines. In addition, we have the right – but not the obligation – in our sole discretion to remove, disallow, block or delete any User Content (i) that we consider to violate these Terms, or (ii) in response to complaints from other users or third parties, with or without notice and without any liability to you. As a result, we recommend that you save copies of any User Content that you post to the Services on your personal device(s) in the event that you want to ensure that you have permanent access to copies of such User Content except live-streaming. We do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness or quality of any User Content, and under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User Content.

You control whether your User Content is made publicly available on the Services to all other users of the Services or only available to people you approve. You can manage the default access setting for how your User Content is presented to other users in your channel settings.

We accept no liability in respect of any content submitted by users and published by us or by authorised third parties.

Before we can respond to your request, you may be required to verify your identity or your account details.

Getcontact takes reasonable measures to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. It is Getcontact’s policy, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, to disable or terminate the accounts of users of the Services who repeatedly infringe copyrights or intellectual property rights of others.
