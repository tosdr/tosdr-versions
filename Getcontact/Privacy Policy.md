Advertising ID means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and for Google prior to Android 12 devices, Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for interest-based advertising. They are consistent across all apps and thus allow cross-app tracking. 

On Apple versions older than iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 you can opt-out this by choosing “limit ad tracking” option from privacy settings. On Google Android you can opt-out by choosing “Opt-out of interest-based ads”.

For Google Android 12 and all subsequent releases, you can reset your GAID or opt out of personalised ads within Google Play at your discretion and at any time. 

Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognise your device when you use websites and applications.
