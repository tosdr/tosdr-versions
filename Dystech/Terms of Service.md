9. General

1. We reserve the right to make changes to these Terms without notice to you. Any amendments to these Terms will have immediate effect from the time that they are published on the Platform.
2. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be deemed deleted from these Terms and replaced by a valid and enforceable provision which so far as possible achieves the parties' intent in agreeing to the original provision. The remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.
3. Subject to any other written and signed agreement between you and us, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties in respect of the subject matter of these Terms and supersedes and replaces any prior written or oral agreements, representations or understandings. The parties confirm that they have not relied on any representation that is not expressly incorporated into these Terms.
4. A failure or delay by us to exercise a power or right under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that power or right, and the exercise of a power or right by us does not preclude our ability to take action in respect of the same type of breach at a future date.
5. These Terms are governed by, and must be construed according to, the law of the State of Victoria, Australia and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State.
