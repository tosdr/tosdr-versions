Definitions within this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in the Terms.

1. Openness and transparency

1. We are committed to protecting your privacy, and upholding your rights under the Australian Privacy Principles (“APPs”) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Privacy Act”). We ensure that we will take all necessary and reasonable steps to comply with the relevant Privacy Laws and to deal with inquiries or complaints from individuals about compliance with the relevant Privacy Laws.

2. By accessing and using our Platform and Services, you freely and expressly agree to and consent to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of your Personal Information by us as set out in this Privacy Policy.  
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    

2. Information

1. Section 6 of the Privacy Act defines ‘Personal Information’ as ‘information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable’. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
2. Your Personal Information:

1. We will collect Personal Information only by lawful and fair means, and not in an unreasonably intrusive way.  
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
2. We will only collect Personal Information about you if you voluntarily provide it to us or if you explicitly give consent to us collecting it. If you provide us with Personal Information, this will constitute your consent.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
3. We will not collect sensitive Personal Information (as defined under the relevant Privacy Laws) from you. We ask that you do not send us, or do not disclose, any sensitive personally identifiable information (such as information related to racial or ethnic origin, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Platform or otherwise. If, contrary to this request, you do provide any sensitive personal information, in doing so you consent to us collecting and handling that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
4. We may also collect Personal Information from you when you fill in an application form, register an Account with us, use our Services, communicate with us, visit our Platform, provide us with feedback or complete online surveys. We may collect Personal Information about you that you have provided to our business partners or from third parties, and in respect of which you have given the third party permission to share with us.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
5. If you use a pseudonym when dealing with us or you do not provide identifiable information to us, we may not be able to provide you with any or all of our Services as requested. If you wish to remain anonymous when you use our Platform, do not sign into it or provide any information that might identify you.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
6. We require individuals to provide accurate, up to date and complete Personal Information at the time it is collected.

The standard contractual clauses are available on the European Commission’s Website at [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection\_en](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1734489456722258&usg=AOvVaw1Mn4R2NcY52B_RYZWy1HXA)

7. Dystech Platform

1. When transmitting Personal Information from your computer to our Platform, you must keep in mind that the transmission of information over the internet is not always completely secure or error-free. Other than liability that cannot lawfully be excluded, we will not be liable in any way in relation to any breach of security or any unintended loss or disclosure of that information.
2. Our Platform may use 'cookies' or other similar tracking technologies that help us track your usage and remember your preferences. Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognise you across different websites, services, devices and/or browsing sessions. You can disable cookies through your internet browser but if you do so, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our Platform.

8. Security and Data Storage

1. We may hold and store your Personal Information in either electronic or hard copy. We take reasonable steps to protect such Personal Information from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure and we use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect Personal Information. For example, our security is managed by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and we utilise SSL/TLS across all our cloud hosting infrastructure for the transmission of Personal Information. Further all Personal Information is stored on AWS secure servers which are fully encrypted.
2. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Information transmitted over the internet and therefore you disclose information to us at your own risk. We will not be liable for any unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, or misuse of your Personal Information

1. require us to correct any Personal Information held about that individual that is inaccurate or incomplete;
2. require the deletion of Personal Information concerning that individual in certain situations;
3. data portability for Personal Information provided to us by that individual;
4. object or withdraw consent to the processing of their Personal Information at any time;
5. object to decisions being taken by automated means which produce legal effects concerning, or significantly affecting them; or

Subject to some exceptions provided by the relevant Privacy Laws, you may request access to your Personal Information in our customer account database or seek a correction to such information, by contacting us in accordance with clause 11 below. Should we decline your request to access some Personal Information, we will provide a written explanation setting out our reasons for doing so.
3. We may charge a reasonable fee that is not excessive to cover the charges of retrieving your Personal Information from our customer account database. However, we will not charge you for making the request.
4. If you believe that we hold Personal Information about you that is not accurate, complete or up-to-date then you may request that your Personal Information be corrected.  We will respond to your request to correct your Personal Information within a reasonable timeframe and we will not charge you a fee for correcting your Personal Information.  
5. If we no longer need your Personal Information for any of the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by the relevant Privacy Laws, we will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to destroy your Personal Information or to de-identify it.
