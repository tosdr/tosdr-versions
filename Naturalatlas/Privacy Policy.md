[](https://github.com/naturalatlas/legal/blob/master/privacy.md#retention-of-information)Retention of Information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any personal content you submit that’s tied to your profile on Natural Atlas is retained permanently unless you delete it or delete your account. You may delete your account at any time, for any reason at [https://naturalatlas.com/account](https://naturalatlas.com/account).

Upon deletion, Natural Atlas will attempt to immediately make the deleted content unavailable. Be aware that certain information may live in caches temporarily for a few days. Content indexed by searches engines such as Google may take considerably longer to disappear.

### [](https://github.com/naturalatlas/legal/blob/master/privacy.md#data-removal-caveats)Data Removal Caveats

* Content submitted to public wiki pages (e.g. place pages) will not be deleted if you delete your account on Natural Atlas. You do reserve the right to remove any content that you once added to these pages – but this must be done by yourself manually prior to account deletion, as there is no good technical way to achieve this automatically.
* Publicly recorded trips, field notes, and other submitted public content may be retained in an anonymized form after deletion to aid with map and product improvements and for aggregate statistics.
* Other aggregated, de-personalized, anonymized information may be retained indefinitely.
