We may share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Rapid7 if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

* Protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Rapid7, our customers or the public.
* Pursue available remedies or limit damages we may sustain.
* Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.
* Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.

If we receive a government or law enforcement request for customer data, we will promptly notify the customer and provide them with a copy of the request, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. Further, we may challenge government or law enforcement requests for customer data that we consider to be overly broad or unlawful.

What are cookies and does Rapid7 use them?
------------------------------------------

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Rapid7) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites. For instance, we use Google Analytics and Google Ads to help analyze how users use our sites. If you would like to opt-out from the use of your information by Google Analytics, you may use [Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) designed for this purpose.

We also may use other third-party tracking technologies, such as pixels to collect or receive information from our sites and elsewhere on the Internet to use such information to enable us to create targeted advertisements and measure the effectiveness of our ads. For additional information on ad targeting and to opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting, please see the paragraph of this Privacy Policy entitled “Interest Based Advertising”.

**How does Rapid7 use them?**

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our sites to operate, and we refer to these as "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our sites. Third parties serve cookies through our sites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. 

To view and control the specific types of first and third-party cookies we serve, please visit on the Cookie Preferences link at the bottom of this page.

**Interest Based Advertising**

We may collect information about your online activities on our sites to provide you with advertising about products tailored to your individual interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our advertisements are served. 

You may see certain advertisements on other websites because we work with advertising partners (including advertising networks) to engage in remarketing and retargeting activities. Our advertising partners allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. These partners track your online activities over time and across websites, including our sites, by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies, web server logs and web beacons. They use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our advertising partners may collect includes data about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our sites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. For example, we utilize certain of our advertising partners’ targeted advertising services to show you our advertisements on other websites based on your prior visits to our sites and other online activity. 

Provided that a company participates in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising, you may opt out of interest-based advertising generally through the Network Advertising Initiative website or by visiting [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (web-based advertising) or [http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices) (for mobile advertising). To learn more, please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance at [www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices). Opting-out does not mean that you will stop receiving advertisements from us. It means that you still stop receiving advertisements from us that have been targeted to you based on your visits and browsing activity across websites over time.

If you maintain an online account with us, we will verify your identity for a request through the normal account authentication process, meaning you will need to sign on with your username and password.

To submit a verifiable request, you will be asked to provide certain information to help us verify your identity. The information we ask you to provide to initiate a request may differ depending upon the type of request, the type, sensitivity and value of the personal information that is the subject of the request, and the risk of harm to you that may occur as a result of unauthorized access or deletion, among other factors.

You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by providing the agent with signed written permission to do so.

If we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request, we will not be able to comply with your request. We will inform you if we cannot verify your identity or authority. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

I'm from the European Economic Area/the UK – is there anything else I should know?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Legal basis for processing personal information**

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area or the UK, our legal basis for collecting and using your information will depend on the information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Where we collect and use your information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), it will normally be obvious from the context what those legitimate interests are. For example, in relation to personal data processed in connection with our provision of services and/or research activities, it is in the legitimate interests of Rapid7 and our customers to detect, remediate and protect against a broad variety of cyber threats.

If we are processing information about you on behalf of a customer in the course of providing our services and solutions to them (i.e. as a data processor), then it is our customer's responsibility to determine the legal basis for the processing we conduct on their behalf. If you ask us about information we are processing on behalf of a customer, we will direct you to speak with the relevant customer.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your information, please contact us using the contact details provided below.

**Additional data protection rights**

In addition to your rights to access, correct, update and delete your information described above, and your right to opt-out of communications also explained above, you also have the right to object to processing of your information, ask us to restrict processing of your information or to request portability of your information. You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided below.

If we have collected and process your information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If you are unhappy with the way we have processed your information, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available [here](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en).)

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
