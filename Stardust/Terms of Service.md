‍

#### **Governing Law**

These Terms and any claims made hereunder (including Arbitrable Claims) will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, except to the extent preempted by U.S. Federal Law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. If any Arbitrable Claim is not subject to arbitration pursuant to the section below, then the state and federal courts located in Manhattan, New York will have exclusive jurisdiction. You and Stardust irrevocably waive any objection to venue in any such courts. If your local law requires that consumer contracts be interpreted subject to local law and enforced in the courts of that jurisdiction, this section may not apply to you only to the extent that local law conflicts with this section.

‍

#### **Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND STARDUST TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND STARDUST FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND STARDUST AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. STARDUST AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.**

**(a)** Arbitrable Claims. For any dispute or claim that you have against Stardust, that Stardust has against you or that you have, or Stardust has, in each case arising from, relating to, or stemming from these Terms, our Services or any aspect of the relationship between you and Stardust as relates to these Terms or our Services, including any privacy or data security claims (collectively, “Arbitrable Claims, and each an “Arbitrable Claim”), you and Stardust agree to attempt to first resolve the Arbitrable Claim informally via the following process. If you assert an Arbitrable Claim against Stardust, you will first contact Stardust by sending a written notice of your Arbitrable Claim (“Claimant Notice”) to Stardust by certified mail addressed to \[mailing address\] or by email to support@stardust.app. The Claimant Notice must (i) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Arbitrable Claim; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Stardust asserts an Arbitrable Claim against you, Stardust will first contact you by sending a written notice of Stardust’s Arbitrable Claim (“Stardust Notice”), and each of a Claimant Notice and Stardust Notice, a “Notice”) to you via email to the primary email address associated with your account. The Stardust Notice must (A) include the name of a Stardust contact and the contact’s email address and telephone number; (B) describe the nature and basis of the Arbitrable Claim; and (C) set forth the specific relief sought. If you and Stardust cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Arbitrable Claim within thirty (30) days after you or Stardust receives such a Notice, then either party may submit the Arbitrable Claim to binding arbitration as set forth below. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for thirty (30) days from the date that either you or Stardust first send the applicable Notice so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.

**(b)** Binding Arbitration. Except for (i) individual disputes that qualify for small claims court or (ii) any disputes exclusively related to the intellectual property or intellectual property rights of you or Stardust, including any disputes in which you or Stardust seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of your or Stardust 's intellectual property rights or other infringement of your or Stardust’s intellectual property rights (“IP Claims”), all Arbitrable Claims, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, including, with respect to Arbitrable Claims that are not related to intellectual property or intellectual property rights but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with subsection (a) above will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Such Arbitrable Claims include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in court.

**(c)** Governance. These Terms affect interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., to the extent permitted by law.

**(d)** Submission. All Arbitrable Claims must be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be resolved through binding arbitration before one arbitrator. If you are a consumer, the then-current version of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply, which are available on the AAA’s website (adr.org), as amended by these Terms as follows:

**1\.** YOU AND STARDUST AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU AND STARDUST ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and, except as described below for the additional procedures to govern if twenty-five (25) or more similar or coordinated claims are asserted against Stardust or you by the same or coordinated counsel, may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

**2\.** For any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the consumer filing fee, and Stardust will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Stardust, Stardust will pay all AAA fees and costs.

**3\.** For all arbitrations where the claims asserted are $25,000 or less, the arbitration shall be resolved according to the AAA’s Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes through Document Submission, and for all other arbitrations the following procedure will apply: (a) the arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate; (b) any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances; and (c) if the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator.

**4\.** If you or Stardust submits a dispute to arbitration and the arbitrator orders any exchange of information, you and Stardust agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and/or other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration. You and Stardust agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, and/or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.

**5\.** The arbitrator's decision will follow these Terms and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.

**6\.** The AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings and the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule will apply if twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against Stardust or against you by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated. In addition to the application of the AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings and the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule, you and Stardust understand and agree that when twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against Stardust or you by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise resolved, your or Stardust’s Arbitrable Claim might be delayed. For such coordinated actions, you and Stardust also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process. Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Stardust shall each select ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial twenty (20) proceedings, each side shall select another ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. A single arbitrator shall preside over each case. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise. This staged process shall continue, consistent with the parameters identified above, until all the claims included in these coordinated filings, including your case, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this staged process from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether process until the time your case is selected for a bellwether process, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against Stardust or you.

**(e)** One Year to Assert Claims. To the extent permitted by law, any Arbitrable Claim by you or Stardust relating in any way to these Terms, our Services, or any aspect of the relationship between you and Stardust as relates to these Terms or our Services, must be filed within one year after such Arbitrable Claim arises; otherwise, the Arbitrable Claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Stardust will not have the right to assert the Arbitrable Claim.

**(f)** Opt-Out Right. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted these Terms by providing us with notice of your decision to opt-out via email at support@stardust.app or by certified mail addressed to "190 Riverside drive New York, NY 10024". In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must also clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with the Governing Law section above.

**(g)** Severability. If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be enforceable.

**(h)** Other Jurisdictions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Terms, if you reside in any country outside of the United States, you may bring legal proceedings regarding the Terms either by following the arbitration procedure detailed above in this Section or, if given the right by applicable law, by submitting the dispute to an arbitration administrator in the jurisdiction in which you reside. To the extent any proceeding is not subject to arbitration under applicable law, you may submit the dispute to the courts of the jurisdiction in which you reside.

‍

#### **Severability**

If it turns out that any part of these Terms is invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. The limitation or elimination of the term will not affect any other terms.

‍

#### **Entire Agreement**

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written with respect to these Services. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

‍

#### **Force Majeure**

We take our commitment to customers seriously, and we’ll do what we can for you. However, sometimes things may come up that are outside of our control. We will not be liable for any failure to perform any of our obligations stated in these Terms if the failure results from a cause beyond our reasonable control, including—without limitation—mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to our workforce), restraints or delays affecting carriers, or our inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials.

‍

#### **Assignment**

You cannot assign, transfer or sublicense these Terms without first obtaining our consent. We may assign, transfer, or delegate any of our rights and obligations without consent. These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship, and neither party has any authority to bind the other in any respect.

‍

#### **Waiver**

If we do not enforce any part of these Terms, it does not mean we give up the right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.

‍

#### **Release**

You release the Company and our successors from all losses, damages, rights, and demands and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that are directly or indirectly related to or arise from your use of the Services (collectively, **“Claims”**). If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him would have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” This release does not apply to any Claims for unconscionable commercial practice by the Company or fraud, deception, false, promise, misrepresentation or concealment, or suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Services.

‍
