#### **2\. Social Media**

Like most other companies, we are dependent on social media profiles in order to distribute and promote our products. We are aware of the critique social media platforms face with regard to data privacy. Therefore, we decided not to access any of the analytics data the platform operators provide to us. For example, we are not interested in knowing any demographic information of the users clicking on Twitter links. We know that this might not be clever from a marketing perspective, but our decision should be seen in the light of our goal to provide privacy-preserving technologies.

This being said, we operate the following social media websites:

* [linkedin.com/company/xaynhq](http://linkedin.com/company/xayn)
    

The operators of the social media platforms (e.g., LinkedIn) are involved in the operation of the websites just listed. They are also responsible (controllers) within the meaning of data protection law. We cannot influence the data processing carried out by the platform operators and are dependent on the information the respective providers give us. To the extent we can exert influence and have a part in determining data processing, we aim to ensure that the operators of the social media platforms treat the data in a manner appropriate to data protection. 

**Data processed by us**

The data you disclose using our social media pages, such as comments, videos, pictures, likes, public news, and so forth are published by the social media platform. We may comment on or delete content if this is necessary (e.g., in case it violates laws). In some cases, we share your content on our site (e.g., when you compliment us publicly) and communicate with you through social media platforms (e.g., when you contact us on such platforms). We use social media platforms for marketing purposes. The legal basis for all those processing activities is our legitimate interest in operating a social media profile and marketing our App ([Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e1888-1-1)).  If we process your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests ([Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e1888-1-1)), you may object to the processing and use of your data. In this case, we will no longer use your data unless our interests prevail.

**Data processed by the operators of social media platforms**

Social media platform operators use web tracking methods. Web tracking can be performed regardless of whether you are logged in or registered with the social media platform. We cannot influence the web tracking methods of the social media platform and, for example, cannot switch such tracking off. We cannot rule out that the provider of the social media platform may use data, for example, to evaluate habits, personal relationships, preferences, etc. In this area of tracking, we have no influence on the processing of data by the platform operator.

Further information on data processing by the provider of the social media platform and further possibilities for objection can be found in the privacy policy of the operators:  

* LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy)
    

We have entered into an agreement with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company regarding joint responsibility for the processing of data (a Controller Addendum). This agreement determines which data processing activities we are responsible for when you visit our LinkedIn website and which are the responsibility of LinkedIn. You can view the agreement at: [https://legal.linkedin.com/pages-joint-controller-addendum](https://legal.linkedin.com/pages-joint-controller-addendum)

Regarding personal data processed by us through social media platforms, you have the same rights as mentioned in our main privacy policy in section 1 above.

This privacy policy is provided by us, Xayn AG, c/o CMS Deutschland, EUREF-Campus 3, 10829 Berlin, GERMANY, [privacy@xayn.com](mailto:privacy@xayn.com?subject=Privacy%20Inquiry) ([imprint](https://www.xayn.com/imprint)).

#### **3\. Change Log**

**Changes to This Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time, so please review it frequently. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on our websites. If we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information previously collected from you through our Services, we will notify you through our Services, by email, or other communication.
