**COMPLETE AGREEMENT**

**ECOMMERCE**

Some of our Sites may allow you to directly purchase our products (“eCommerce Sites”). Although we have a variety of Sites that sell different types of products and services, the provisions of this Agreement apply to all of them.

**Orders**

We may make improvements and/or changes in products or services described on the eCommerce Sites, add new features, or terminate an eCommerce Site at any time without notice. We also: (a) reserve the right to change the goods and services advertised or offered for sale through an eCommerce Site, the prices or specifications of such goods and services, and any promotional offers at any time without any notice or liability to you or any other person; (b) cannot guarantee that goods or services advertised or offered for sale on an eCommerce Site will be available when ordered or thereafter; (c) reserve the right to limit quantities sold or made available for sale; (d) do not warrant that information on an eCommerce Site (including, without limitation, product descriptions, colors or photographs) is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free; and (e) reserve the right to modify, cancel, terminate or not process orders (including accepted orders) where the price or other material information on an eCommerce Site is inaccurate, where we have insufficient quantities to fulfill an order or for any other reason in our sole discretion. If we do not process an order for such reason, we will either not charge you or will apply credit to the payment type used in the order. Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusions and disclaimers of certain implied warranties, so some of the provisions of this section may not apply to you. 

_Taxes:_ If we are legally required to collect sales tax on merchandise you order, the tax amount will be added automatically to your purchase price. On rare occasions an error in our tax database may cause the sales tax charge to be incorrect. If this happens, at any time up to two years from your date of purchase you may [contact us](https://www.3dayblinds.com/contact-us) for a refund of tax overcharges. This right to a refund is your exclusive remedy for sales tax errors.

_Payment Processing:_ We may use a third-party payment processor to process your payment information, including your payment card data. Be aware that you may be subject to the third-party processor’s terms and your information may be subject to their privacy practices. 

**Returns, Exchanges and Repairs**

Some eCommerce Sites and brands may offer returns, exchanges and repairs for products and services you obtain through the eCommerce Site. Returns, exchanges and repairs will not be issued for products or services that have not been purchased directly through an eCommerce Site. You can generally locate specific information about returns, exchanges and repairs by reviewing the policies in the footers of each Site (collectively, the “Return Policies”). All Return Policies are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. By using a Site or otherwise agreeing to this Agreement, you agree to be bound by all Return Polices.   
We reserve the right to deny a return, exchange or repair request if we determine that our Return Policies are being abused. We may use any means available to us, including coordination with other companies, to determine if you are abusing our Return Policies. This decision is made in our sole discretion and determination. Please note that we are unable to issue any refunds for products and services unless specifically indicated on a Site or in a Return Policy. 

**Promo Codes and Discounts**  

Certain Sites create or advertise promo codes, discounts, coupon codes and offers that provide a benefit to you when entered upon checkout. These cannot be applied to prior or completed transactions, they must be provided at the time of purchase. Generally, promo codes and discounts cannot be combined with other offers. Only consumers can use promo codes, they cannot be used by resellers, wholesalers, practitioners, or the like. 

**Rebates**  

**Some Sites and brands may offer rebates on certain products. Rebates require you to provide us or the manufacturer with certain information after your purchase in order to receive money back. The specific information required for rebates vary based on the offer.** All details about specific rebate offers and programs can be obtained by reading the complete terms of the rebate offer. Additional information and rebate forms can be obtained by contacting participating dealers.

It is our policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to identify or protect their copyrighted works that we determine are reasonable under the circumstances.

If you believe that any Content on a Site infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, you may send a written notification to our designated copyright agent (the “**Designated Agent**”), identified below, with the following information:

1. A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, with sufficient detail so that we can identify the alleged infringing material;  
    
2. The URL or other specific location on the Site that contains the alleged infringing material described in (1) above, with reasonably sufficient information to enable us to locate the alleged infringing material;  
    
3. Your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address;  
    
4. The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner’s behalf;  
    
5. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and  
    
6. A statement by you that the information contained in your notice is accurate and that you attest under penalty of perjury that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf  
    

Designated Agent: Greenberg Traurig, LLP  
Email:   DMCAAgent@gtlaw.com  
Address: 1144 15th Street, Suite 3300 | Denver, Colorado 80202  
  
To notify the provider of the allegedly infringing material to which we have removed or disabled access, we may forward a copy of your infringement notice, including your name and email address to the provider of the allegedly infringing material. 

We may terminate users who, in our sole discretion, are deemed to be repeat infringers. Knowingly misrepresenting in a notification that material is infringing can subject you to damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer. If you receive an infringement notification from us, you may file a counter notification pursuant with our Designated Agent pursuant to the DMCA. To file a counter notification, please provide our Designated Agent with the following information: 

1. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access was disabled;  
    
2. Your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address;  
    
3. The following statement: “I consent to the jurisdiction of \[insert one of the following: (1) “the Federal District Court in which my mailing address is located”, or (2) if you reside outside of the United States, “the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York”\];”;  
    
4. The following statement: “I will accept service of process from \[insert the name of the person who submitted the infringement notification\] or his/her agent;”  
    
5. The following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the affected material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;” and  
    
6. Your signature, in physical or electronic form.  
    

Upon receipt of valid counter notification, we will promptly provide the person who provided the original infringement notification with a copy of your counter notification and inform that person that we will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in ten (10) business days. Further, we will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it not less than ten (10), nor more than fourteen (14), business days following receipt of your counter notice, unless Designated Agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the original infringement notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site.

You may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination, including your detailed contact information and any Account information or other Site credentials, to us using the information in the [Contact Us](https://www.3dayblinds.com/contact-us) section. In addition to any right or remedy that may be available to us under applicable law, we may suspend, limit, or terminate all or a portion of your access to a Site or any of its features at any time with or without notice and with or without cause, including, without limitation, if we believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement. We may be protected for liability from these actions under the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. § 230.

The provisions of this Agreement concerning protection of intellectual property rights, authorized use, user submitted content, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnity and disputes, as well as any other provisions that by their nature should survive, shall survive any such termination.

Upon any such termination, (i) you must destroy all Content obtained from the Sites and all copies thereof; (ii) you will immediately cease all use of and access to the Sites; (iii) we may delete or disable access to any of your User Content at any time; (iv) and we may delete your Registered User Account at any time.

Your use of a Site after termination will be a violation of this Section, which survives any termination. 

Even after the termination of this Agreement or of your Account or access to a Site, any User Content you have posted or submitted may remain on a Site indefinitely.

**Children**

Our Sites are not designed to appeal to minors, and we do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children under thirteen (13) years of age.

**SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. REGARDLESS OF THE PREVIOUS SENTENCES, IF WE ARE FOUND TO BE LIABLE, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE ACTUAL TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVED BY US FROM YOU OR THE LOWEST LIABILITY LIMITATION ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW.**

**Disputes, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BE REPRESENTED BY A LAWYER IN ARBITRATION OR PROCEED WITHOUT ONE. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Except as may be otherwise described herein, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, other agreements on the Site, or the [Privacy Policy](https://www.3dayblinds.com/privacy-policy), or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be either determined by binding arbitration in Pear River, New York before one arbitrator or submitted to small claims court in Rockland County, New York. If the arbitrator finds this location to be unreasonably burdensome to you, a new location may be selected or arbitration may be conducted over the phone, using video conferencing, or similar. You may be entitled to an in-person hearing near your place of residence. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having appropriate jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2. Reasonable discovery will be allowed during arbitration in accordance with these rules. The JAMS Rules are available at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling 1-800-352-5267 (within the USA)

**_No Class Actions:_** EXCEPT FOR COORDINATED CLAIMS (AS DEFINED BELOW), YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS OR ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU AND WE ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ARBITRATION OR CLASS ACTION. Further, except for Coordinated Claims (defined below), unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your or our claims respectively, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and shall be severed from the remainder of this Agreement.

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. 

_Seeking Arbitration:_ If you believe you have a dispute with us, prior to initiating arbitration or filing a claim in small claims court, you must first call our customer service representatives and present your claim or dispute to allow us the opportunity to resolve the claim or dispute. Similarly, if we believe we have a dispute with you, our customer service representatives will first contact you in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If the dispute cannot be resolved by customer service and either you or we intend to seek arbitration, the party wishing to initiate arbitration must send to the other party, a written notice of the claim (“**Notice**”). Your Notice to us must be delivered by certified mail and addressed to: HD Legal Department, 1 Blue Hill Plaza (21st Floor), Pearl River, NY 10965. If we initiate arbitration, we will send a written Notice to an email address or other contact information you have previously provided to us, if available. We may also use any other means to contact you, including a message in your Account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by us, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. Arbitration forms can be downloaded from [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/). Except in the event of a Coordinated Claim (as defined below), if you are required to pay a filing fee, after we receive Notice that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000 or the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.

_Hearing__:_ If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. In the event that the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of submitted documents, the arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator, unless extended by the arbitrator. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.

_Award:_ In the event arbitration awards you damages of an amount at least US$100 greater than our last documented settlement offer, we will pay your awarded damages or US$2,500, whichever is greater.

_Coordinated Proceedings:_ If twenty-five (25) or more individuals initiate Notices of dispute with us raising similar claims, and counsel for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or are coordinated for these individuals (“**Coordinated Claims**”), the claims shall proceed in arbitration in a coordinated proceeding. Counsel for the individuals and counsel for Company shall each select five (5) cases to proceed first in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding (“**Test Cases**”). The remaining cases shall not be filed in arbitration until the first ten (10) have been resolved. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the Test Cases, each side may select another five (5) cases to proceed to arbitration for a second bellwether proceeding. This process may continue until the parties have determined an objective methodology to make an offer to resolve each and every outstanding claim. A court will have authority to enforce this clause and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against Company. Individuals bringing Coordinated Claims shall be responsible for up to US$250 of their filing fees or the maximum permissible under the applicable arbitration rules. All applicable statutes of limitations and defenses based upon the passage of time will be tolled while the Coordinated Proceedings specified in this Section are pending. We will take such action, if any, required to effectuate such tolling.

_Injunctive Relief:_ Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and we both agree that you or we may sue in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights or in other scenarios where injunctive relief is appropriate. In the event a court or arbitrator having jurisdiction finds any portion of this Agreement unenforceable, that portion shall not be effective and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain effective. No waiver, express or implied, by either party of any breach of or default under this Agreement will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.

_Confidentiality:_ The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

_Governing Law and Rules:_ This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits. The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of this Agreement) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement.
