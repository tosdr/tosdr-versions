Cookie Notice
=============

Effective: July 29, 2024  
  

This Cookie Notice explains how [Workday](https://www.workday.com/en-us/privacy.html?tab=privacy-statement&#contact-us "Workday") uses cookies and similar technologies (collectively, “**Cookies**”) to recognize you when you visit a Workday website or use a Workday app that links to the [Privacy Statement](https://www.workday.com/en-us/privacy.html) (each a “**Website**” and collectively, the “**Websites**”). It explains what Cookies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control their use.

To learn more about which Cookies we use and for which purposes, please visit Cookie Preferences, which can be found in the Websites’ footer. To learn more about how we process personal information and the identity of the controller depending on your jurisdiction, please visit our [Privacy Statement](https://www.workday.com/en-us/privacy.html "Privacy Statement"). 

**What are Cookies?**

Cookies are small data files that are stored and accessed on your device when you visit websites or other digital properties. They allow websites and apps to recognize your device the next time you visit, and track your use of the digital property, browsing history, personal preferences and interests, and improve and customize your browsing experience. Cookies may contain or transmit unique identifiers that are considered personal information under certain data protection laws, such as IP address, device information, and website usage. 

**Why do we use Cookies on Workday Websites?**

We use Cookies for three main purposes:

* **Required Cookies** are strictly necessary to enable basic features of the Website and for security purposes related to user interaction. For example, we use Required Cookies to ensure the Websites’ content is displayed correctly, to keep your individual language settings, temporarily store your input in webforms, identify and record your consent status for our **Cookie Preferences** manager according to your country, provide load-balancing functionality, and ensure session management when you authenticate and access secure areas of the Websites. 
* **Functional Cookies**, which include performance Cookies, allow more functionality on our Website, but also allow us and third parties to analyze your use of the Website to evaluate and improve our performance as well as to provide a better customer experience on our websites. For example, we use Functional Cookies to enable audio and video player functionality, to provide live chat services, or to recognize your device when you fill out a webform. Such Cookies may collect and combine visitor usage information such as page views, session information, and bounce rate. 
* **Advertising Cookies** allow us and third parties (specified in our **Cookie Preferences** manager) to better understand your interests and show you personalized ads that are more relevant to you on our Websites and/or on third-party websites. These Cookies are used to track users over time and across websites, including by third parties. These Cookies may also reveal how many visitors with specific user profiles and preferences have seen or clicked on our advertisements to optimize our advertising campaigns. 

**What about other tracking technologies?**

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to our Websites. We use other similar but technically different means (such as tracking pixels or software development kits \[SDKs\], web beacons, HTTP Etags, local and session storage, TLS Session IDs, and JavaScript). For example, tracking pixels are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the browsing history of users from one page within our Websites to another, to store or access Cookies, to understand whether users have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies (covered by the term “Cookies”) allow our Websites or other digital properties to function properly, and so declining Cookies may impair their functioning and affect your user experience.  

**How can you control Cookies?**

Except for Required Cookies, you have the right to decide whether to accept or decline Cookies. Where required we will only set Functional and Advertising Cookies if you enable them. Regardless of your location, you can exercise your Cookie preferences through our **Cookie Preferences** manager at any time (link located in the footer of our Website), even if you initially accepted or declined all or certain cookies. 

You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse Cookies. If you choose to reject Cookies, you can still use our Websites to perform the requested service, although your access to some additional functionality and areas may be restricted. Because web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.  

**Opt out of sharing for targeted advertising.  
**

Under some data protection laws, our sharing of basic information, device information, internet activity, and commercial information with third parties through cookies and other trackers may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” for targeted advertising.   

You may opt out of all cookies that may result in a “sale” and/or “share” of Personal Information for targeted advertising in the following ways:

* In the **Cookie Preferences** manager,  opt OUT of Advertising Cookies. If you visit us from a different device or browser, or clear cookies, then you may need to return to this screen to re-select your preferences.
* Set the **Global Privacy Control** for each participating browser system that you use (see below).

**What about Do Not Track (DNT) and Global Privacy Control (GPC)?**

Our Websites currently do not respond to the Do Not Track (DNT) browser signal. In certain jurisdictions, you may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) opt-out preference signal to opt out of the use of third-party Advertising Cookies. For instructions on how to download and use GPC, please visit [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/ "global privacy control").

If you have questions about our use of Cookies or other technologies, please contact us as provided in our [Privacy Statement](https://www.workday.com/en-us/privacy.html "privacy statement").
