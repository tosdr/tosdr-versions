**15\. Dispute Resolution Provisions.** Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or related to these terms and conditions or your use of the Site, Services, or the Program, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a “Dispute”) shall be solely and exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If the parties are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute by sending notice demanding arbitration to the other party as the exclusive means to resolve a Dispute. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the Dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim or facts forming the basis of the Dispute. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to American Arbitration Association rules and procedures for consumer arbitration (if you are a consumer) or commercial arbitration (if you are a business) (the “Arbitration Rules”). The arbitration shall be conducted in Franklin County, Ohio before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules with the option to appeal the arbitrator’s decision to an Optional Appellate Arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against any party. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, arbitration costs and fees shall be divided equally between the parties. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, attorneys’ fees shall be borne by each party independently and no party shall be liable for the attorneys’ fees of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the arbitrator determines that a filed Dispute is frivolous, the arbitrator, applying applicable law, may award the prevailing party its attorneys’ fees and costs. No disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE; WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO PRESENT ITS CLAIM OR DISPUTE IN A COURT OF LAW; AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO BRING A DISPUTE MORE THAN ONE YEAR FROM WHEN IT KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE CONTROVERSY, CLAIM, OR FACTS FORMING THE BASIS OF THE DISPUTE. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s), if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

You may opt out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Site. Thereafter, these dispute resolution provisions shall be final and binding. Opt-out here: [https://myinjuryclaimcenter.com/unsubscribe/](https://myinjuryclaimcenter.com/unsubscribe/)

**16\. Miscellaneous.** Should any part of the Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. The Agreement is personal between you and Company and governs your use of the Site and Services, superseding any and all prior and/or contemporaneous agreements between you and Company. To the extent that anything in or associated with the Site, the Services, and/or any Company offering is in conflict or inconsistent with the Agreement, the Agreement shall take precedence. Our failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision. The parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created through operation of the Agreement.
