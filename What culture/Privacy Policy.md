This notice applies to any website or service which references this Privacy Notice. This Privacy Policy is also relevant for any EEA resident sharing his/her personal data directly or indirectly with What Culture Limited**.** Where you provide us with your personal information in any of the ways described below, you agree that we may collect, store and use it (a) in order to perform our contractual obligations to you, (b) based on our legitimate interest for processing (i.e. for internal administrative purposes or for the detection or prevention of crime) or (c) based on your consent, which you may withdraw at any time, as described in this Privacy Notice.

It is important that you read this Privacy Policy together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your information. This Privacy Policy supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.

Our Privacy Notice applies to all products and services offered by What Culture Limited (a company incorporated in England with company registration number 07243682 and whose registered office address is What Culture Studios, Mulgrave Terrace, Gateshead, NE8 1PQ), but excludes any products or services that have separate privacy notices which do not incorporate this Privacy Notice.

To the extent permissible under applicable law, we collect information about you and any other party whose details you provide to us when you:

\- complete online forms;

We may do this using cookies or similar technologies (as described below).

We may enhance personal information we collect from you with information we obtain from third parties that are entitled to share that information; for example, information from data management platforms, but in each case as permitted by applicable laws.

If you intend giving us personal information about someone else, you are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any obligation and consent obligations under applicable data protections laws. In so far as required by applicable data protection laws, you must ensure that beforehand you have their explicit consent to do so and that you explain to them how we collect, use, disclose and retain their personal information or direct them to read our Privacy Notice.

**How we use your information**

\- obtain information relating to any technical errors or other issues with our website and services;

\- collect information about how you and users use the functions of the features of our website and services; and

\- gather statistical information about the operating system and environment from which you access our applications or services.

You can manage your privacy settings within your browser or our website and services (where applicable).

We may combine your data, and the data of others to produce anonymous aggregate data. This data is for analytical purposes to assess the effectiveness of our services. If said data were to include any data that could be personally identifiable to any person, we would treat the aggregate data as personal data and process it in the same way as any other personal data.

In addition to the purposes described in this section, we may also use information we gather to identify you when visiting our websites, deliver targeted advertising, marketing or information to you which may be useful, based on your use of the website or services or any other information we have about you (depending on the websites or services, you may able to configure these features to suit your preferences). Subsequent sections of this Privacy Notice provides further details on how we will do this. We may also use your information to provide services and perform analytics regarding the effectiveness of these services, and to help us fulfil technical support requests.

We may monitor and record our communications with you, including e-mails and phone conversations. Information which we collect may then be used for training purposes, quality assurance, to record details about our website and services you order from us or ask us about, and in order to meet our legal and regulatory obligations generally.

We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which it was collected, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

We do not collect any sensitive personal information about you, such as details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, or information about your health and genetic and biometric information.

We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity. We do not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will exercise our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

**Types of Data We Collect (General)**
--------------------------------------

In order to support the operation of our websites and services, various types of personal information is provided by or requested from the users of the websites. The following table outlines the personal information we collect, and how it is used by us.

**IP Address**: This is collected automatically when you use our website, and is used when delivering relevant advertisements to you, and to determine the effectiveness of such advertisements. We also use this for analytical purposes, such as determining the geographical origin of any traffic we receive to our websites.

**Browser Type**: This is collected automatically when you use our website, and is used when delivering relevant advertisements to you, and to determine the effectiveness of such advertisements. This information is also used to ensure we deliver an experience to you that is certain to be compatible and effective, such as making special arrangements for browsers that are older or more obscure, or in circumstances such as the deactivation of site technologies such as JavaScript.

**Email Address**: This is collected during user-elected registration and is used to register your account and to receive relevant service related email correspondence. Your email address is not used for advertisement purposes (except if you elect to be added to any mailing lists we may make available), and is not shared with any other party unless we are legally bound to do so. This may also be collected if you decide to contact us for technical support or to receive/provide feedback about us or our services.

**Your name**: This is collected during user-elected registration and is used to register your account. This is also used to attribute provided content to you, when producing invoices for said content. This is not shared with any other party unless we are legally bound to do so.

**Your address and postal / ZIP code**: These are collected during user-elected opt-in to receive payments for article contributions, and are used in the generation of invoices relating to any content you provide to us. This data is only collected when a user wishes to be paid for their content, and is not requested prior to this.

**Your Country of residence**: This data is manually entered after registration, and allows us to ensure that any invoices created on your behalf are paid out correctly, allowing us to take regional tax and VAT regulations into account when issuing payments. This also allows currency conversions to be conducted properly when issuing payments.

**Profile information**: This data is manually entered after registration, and is used to allow users to tell other users about themselves in order to personalise their account and experience on the website.

**Social Media profiles (Facebook, Twitter, Skype)**: This data is manually entered after registration, and allows us to show links to your social media profiles within the content that you write, allowing other users of the site, and yourself, to share your content with others. These social media profiles are not shared with any other party except via the above mechanism, at the optional discretion of the user.

**User Role**: This data is stored against the user to help determine the set of actions that a particular user is eligible to perform when using our website.

**Permissions**: In addition to the above, these are specific permissions attached to each user outside of their general user role, and allows us to further customise the level of access a particular user has to various website functions.

**Fees Information**: This is stored against the user and allows us to determine how much to pay a particular user when invoices are generated on their behalf for content provided to us.

**Categories**: This is a set of website categories (Gaming, TV, etc.) that are stored against the user and help us determine that kinds of content each user regularly submits to us.

**Application and Employment Data**: If you apply to work for What Culture Limited or become an employee, we may collect personal information necessary to process your application and employment. This will generally include the personal information described in this policy in addition to National Insurance Number (or applicable alternative), and details of your bank account to receive any due salary and/or benefits. We may also collect information relating to your employment history and appropriate references.

**Payment Information**: In addition to the purpose provided above, we will also collect your payment details when you elect to provide them, for the satisfaction of any invoices that we create for any content or services you provide to us.

**Log Files**: These are created automatically by our web server, and contains information such as your IP address, browser types, dates/times and referring pages. This information is not linked to any other personally identifiable data, and is used to ensure the service we deliver is reliable and relevant, and to assist in the identification and remedy of site faults.

**Types of Date We Collect (YouTube APIs)**
-------------------------------------------

In addition to the user data specified above, the website collects the following information from users that have been given access to the areas of the website that directly interacts with or makes use of the various YouTube APIs. Other information is collected to form a video upload which is not specific to the YouTube API, such as the source of the video (adaptation from an existing article or original content, playlist, etc.) which is used by the website only, and is not used with calls to the YouTube APIs.

Our website interacts with YouTube via its APIs, and makes use of YouTube API services. By using these services, users are agreeing to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service, which can be found at [https://www.youtube.com/t/terms](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms).

Google’s Privacy Policy can be found at [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy).

**Video Title**: This is provided by the user when preparing an upload to YouTube, and allows the content to be uploaded to be identified.

**Video Description**: This is provided by the user when preparing an upload to YouTube, and allows the content to be properly described before upload.

**Video Privacy Status**: This is provided by the user when preparing an upload to YouTube, and allows the user to set the visibility of a YouTube upload once it has been completed. Options include public, unlisted, and private.

**Thumbnail**: This is provided by the user when preparing an upload to YouTube, and ensures that the video will have a proper thumbnail when it is uploaded to YouTube.

**Channel**: This is provided by the user when preparing an upload to YouTube, and is used to ensure that the video content is published to the correct area of YouTube when it is uploaded.

**Video File**: This is the media file uploaded to our website, which is then sent along with the other data about the video.

**Video ID**: This is used for existing videos to update information about them, such as a new title or description, and to uniquely identify a video that is requested to be deleted.

**View Count**: This is collected automatically for each video uploaded via our system, and is used as the basis for analytics in order to assess the popularity of our content and trends.

**Minutes Watched**: This is collected automatically for each video uploaded via our system, and is used as the basis for analytics in order to assess the popularity of our content and trends.

**View Duration**: This is collected automatically for each video uploaded via our system, and is used as the basis for analytics in order to assess the popularity of our content and trends.

**View Percentage**: This is collected automatically for each video uploaded via our system, and is used as the basis for analytics in order to assess the popularity of our content and trends.

**Estimated Revenue**: This is collected automatically for each video uploaded via our system, and is used as the basis for analytics in order to assess the popularity of our content and trends.

**CPM**: This is calculated automatically for each video uploaded via our system (using view counts and estimated revenue), and is used as the basis for analytics in order to assess the popularity of our content and trends.

Data in the above table is not shared externally (except between ourselves and YouTube when uploading or changing any YouTube content that originated from our website), and is shared internally amongst those employees who have been given access to see and use this information. Only the employees who have been deemed to have a legitimate business need to access the data are allowed to see and/or use it. Members of the public that sign up to use our services are not able to see this information, unless we, in our discretion, believe it presents a reasonable business need to provide that information to them. This may apply, for example, if we enlist the services of Freelance individuals who require the data to carry out their work.

In addition to our normal procedure for deleting stored data, users can revoke access to their data as it relates to the YouTube API by visiting the Google security settings page at [https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions).

Users may contact the website owner or developer with questions or complaints about our privacy practices as related to the use of YouTube APIs.

As part of its operation, our website interacts with the YouTube APIs in order to upload, update and delete YouTube videos on the channels made available from within the website. The website also interacts with the YouTube APIs in order to obtain analytical data such as view counts, watched duration, average duration percentage, and so on. Furthermore, the website periodically interacts with the YouTube APIs in order to keep any analytical data previously gathered up to date and complete.

If you withdraw your consent to the use of your personal information for purposes set out in our Privacy Notice, we may not be able to provide you with access to all or parts of our website and services.

We will retain your personal information for the duration of our business relationship and afterwards for as long as is necessary and relevant for our legitimate business purposes, in accordance with our data retention, marking and destruction policy or as otherwise permitted applicable laws and regulation. Where we no longer need your personal information, we will dispose of it in a secure manner (without further notice to you).

**Changes to our privacy notice**
---------------------------------

We may change our Privacy Notice from time to time. However we will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Notice. We will always update this Privacy Notice on our website, so please try to read it when you visit the website (the ‘last updated’ reference tells you when we last updated our Privacy Notice).

**Security and storage of information**
---------------------------------------

We will keep your information secure by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage. We will do our best to protect your personal information but we cannot guarantee the security of your information which is transmitted to our website or services or to other website, applications and services via an internet or similar connection. If we have given you (or you have chosen) a password to access certain areas of our websites or services please keep this password safe – we will not share this password with anyone.

In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any unauthorized access to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or if permitted by law, by telephone. We will also notify any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

Our websites permit you to create an account, or have the facility for an account to be created on your behalf. When this happens, you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account. If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us at privacy@whatculture.com.

We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including the fulfillment of the contract, the initiation of a contract, or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or other regulatory reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

**Transfers outside of the European Economic Area**
---------------------------------------------------

Personal information in the European Union is protected by data protection laws but other countries do not necessarily protect your personal information in the same way.

Our website and some of our applications or services or parts of them may also be hosted in the United States or otherwise outside of the EEA (which means all the EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) (“EEA”) and this means that we may transfer any information which is submitted by you through the website or the application or service outside the EEA to the United States or to other territories outside of the EEA. When you send an email to us, this will also be stored on email servers which are hosted with Google and therefore may be outside of the EEA.

We may use service providers based outside of the EEA to help us provide our website and services to you and this means that we may transfer your information to service providers outside the EEA for the purpose of providing our advertising and services to you.

We take steps to ensure that where your information is transferred outside of the EEA by our service providers and hosting providers, appropriate measures and controls are in place to protect that information in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. In each case, such transfers are made in accordance with the requirements of Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulations or “GDPR”) and may be based on the use of the European Commission’s Standard Model Clauses for transfers of personal data outside the EEA.

By using our website, products or services or by interacting with us in the ways described in this Privacy Notice, you consent to the transfer of your information outside the EEA in the circumstances set out in this Privacy Notice. If you do not want your information to be transferred outside the EEA you should not use our website, applications or services.
