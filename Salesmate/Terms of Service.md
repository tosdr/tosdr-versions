#### Establishing an Account

Certain features, functions, parts or elements of the Salesmate can be used or accessed only by holders of an Account. The person who wishes to create an Account must:

1. Complete the sign-up form on the Web Site
2. Accept these Terms by clicking ’’Sign up’’ or other similar button

Each Client may have only one Account. If several persons need to use an Account on behalf of Client, Client must designate such persons as Users. Each such User shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms.

If Client has designated Users and granted them Authorization, such Users will be deemed to be authorized to act on behalf of Client when using the Account. Salesmate is not responsible for and shall have no liability for verifying the validity of Authorization of any User. However, Salesmate may, in its discretion, request additional information or proof of the person’s credentials. If Salesmate is not certain if a User has been granted Authorization, Salesmate may, in its sole discretion, prevent such User from accessing the Salesmate Services.

A User may be associated with multiple Clients and Accounts. Deleting a User from one Account will not remove the User from the Platform if he/she is connected to multiple Accounts.

The Client and any User associated with an Account must provide Salesmate with true, accurate, current, and complete information about the Client, Users or Account and keep it up to date.

#### Logging Into an Account

Salesmate shall provide Client with a username and password (’’Login Credentials’’) to be used to log in to its Account unless the Client uses the another services to log in. These Login Credentials must not be used by multiple persons. If Client has designated several Users, each User will be provided with separate Login Credentials. Client and each User are responsible for keeping confidential all login credentials associated with an Account.

#### Termination of Account

Client may terminate these Terms at any time as provided in ’’Suspension and Termination’’ section. Salesmate shall permanently delete the Account \[ user information \] within one month of the effective date of the termination.

#### Fees

The use of an Account is subject to a Fee. Upon sign-up for an Account, the Client must select a Plan. Different rates apply to different Plans. The applicable Fee is charged in advance on monthly or annual payment intervals, unless agreed otherwise between parties. All Fees are non-refundable (user subscription, voice credits, etc.), i.e. there are no refunds or credits for periods where the Client did not use an activated Account, used it only partially, or deactivated the Account or terminated these Terms during an ongoing payment interval. If, after signing up, Client elects to upgrade to a more expensive Plan, the unused portion of any prepaid Fees shall be applied to the Fee of the more expensive Plan.

All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies or duties applicable under any applicable law, unless stated otherwise stated herein. Client is solely responsible for the payment of such taxes, levies or duties.

#### Changing Plans

Any Client has the right to upgrade or downgrade a current Plan at any time by selecting a new Plan among the collection of Plans determined by the Salesmate. In such an event, the Client’s credit card on file with the Salesmate will automatically be charged with a Fee for the next payment interval with the rate stipulated in the new Plan.

Downgrading of the current Plan may cause the loss of features or capacity of the Account, as well as the loss of Client Data.

#### Free Trial

A new Client may be entitled to a Free Trial, unless the Client has applied for the Account as a result of an ongoing marketing campaign organized by the Salesmate in co-operation with its partners. The Client is not required to provide any credit card information during the period of Free Trial. If the period of Free Trial has expired, the Account will be automatically deactivated. In order to prevent deactivation or to reactivate the Account, the Client is required to select a suitable Plan and pay the first Fee. If the Client does not pay the first Fee within 2 weeks as of the expiry of the Free Trial, Salesmate has the right to permanently delete the Account, including all Client Data therein.

Billing, Plan Modifications and Payments
----------------------------------------

#### Subscription Charges

Except during Your free trial, all charges associated with Your Account (’’Subscription Charges’’) are due in full and payable in advance when You subscribe to the Service(s). Unless specified otherwise in a Form, the Subscription Charges are based on the Service Plans You choose and are payable in full until You terminate Your Account. You will receive a receipt upon each receipt of payment by Us. You may also obtain a payment receipt from within the Service(s).

#### Payment Methods

You may pay the Subscription Charges through Your credit card, or other accepted payment methods as specified in a Form. For credit card payments, Your payment is due immediately upon Your renewal date. You hereby authorize Us or Our authorized agents, as applicable, to bill Your credit card upon Your subscription to the Service(s) (and any renewal thereof). For payments through other accepted methods, Your payment is due within seven (7) days of Our invoice date unless otherwise stated in a Form.

#### Renewal

Your subscription to the Service(s) will renew automatically for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term. Unless otherwise provided for in any Form, the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subscription to the Service(s) for any such subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the Service Plan to which You have subscribed as of the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences. You acknowledge and agree that, unless You terminate Your Account, Your credit card will be charged automatically for the applicable Subscription Charges.

We may use a third party service provider to manage credit card and other payment processing; provided, that such service provider is not permitted to store, retain or use Your payment account information except to process Your credit card and other payment information for Us. You must notify Us of any change in Your credit card or other payment account information, either by updating Your Account or by e-mailing Us at support@salesmate.io.

Refunds: Unless otherwise specified in these Terms or a Form or a Service Plan, all Subscription Charges are nonrefundable. No refunds shall be issued for partial use or non-use of the Service(s) by You.

#### Late Payments/Non-payment of Subscription Charges

We will notify You if We do not receive payment towards the Subscription Charges within the due date for Your Account. For payments made through credit cards, We must receive payments due within a maximum of five (5) days from the date of Our notice and for payments through other accepted methods, We must receive payments within a maximum of fifteen (15) days from the date of Our notice. If We do not receive payment within the foregoing time period, in addition to Our right to other remedies available under law, We may (i) charge an interest for late payment @ 1.5% per month and/or; (ii) suspend Your access to and use of the Service(s) until We receive Your payment towards the Subscription Charges as specified herein and/or; (iii) terminate Your Account as explained in "Suspension and Termination" section.

#### Upgrades and Downgrades

You may upgrade or downgrade within a Service Plan or between two Service Plans. You understand that downgrading may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service(s) as available to You before downgrading Your Account. We will not be liable for such loss. When You upgrade, the new Subscription Charges become immediately applicable. Upon upgrade, the new Subscription Charges for the subsisting month would be charged on pro-rated basis and Your credit card will be charged automatically. Subsequent months will be charged in full according to the new Subscription Charges. Upon downgrade, no refunds will be provided. Your account will be auto downgraded from next billing period.

#### Applicable Taxes

Unless otherwise stated, the Subscription Charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively "Taxes’’). You are responsible for paying the Taxes that would be levied against You by government authorities. We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced.

#### User Benefits

Apart from the credits provided to You when You downgrade, We may, at Our sole discretion, offer You certain benefits such as discounts on Subscription Charges, extension in Subscription Term for no extra payments from You, with regard to the Service(s). These benefits are specific to Your Account and the Service(s) identified while offering these benefits. They are not transferable. The benefits may have an expiry date. If they do not have an expiry date, they will expire upon completion of twelve (12) months from their date of offer.

#### Charges for Add-Ons

Some features are offered as add-ons inside Salesmate. If you add on a feature that has a charge, then you’ll be billed that additional amount with each billing cycle for as long as the add-on is active. Some add-ons are intended for particular use cases and may have additional terms or restrictions ("Additional Terms.") If you use an add-on in a way that violates these Terms or the Additional Terms, then we may terminate your account.
