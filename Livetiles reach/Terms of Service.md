General Terms and Conditions CYCL AG Issue December 2019

1 Scope and Validity

tionships between partners and customers (hereinafter

and apply to all products, services and third-party products

distributed by CYCL. The GTC form an integral part of all

contracts concluded between the business partners and

CYCL, unless expressly agreed otherwise. Provisions devi-

ating from the GTC only become legally binding if they are

expressly offered by CYCL or expressly accepted in writing

by CYCL.



2 Service Descriptions



1. CYCL manufactures IT products, provides IT services in the

areas of consulting, systems engineering, software develop-

ment and support and distributes third-party products from

software and hardware manufacturers. The content and

scope of the individual products and services are based on

the service descriptions contained in the respective con-

tracts, agreements and order confirmations (hereinafter re-

ferred to as "service descriptions"). The content agreed in

detail in these service descriptions takes precedence over

the General Terms and Conditions. The manufacturer's

specifications apply to third-party products. The services of

CYCL are rendered in return for remuneration on a time and

material basis and without responsibility for results, unless

expressly agreed otherwise.



3 Coming into Effect of Contracts



1. All information provided by CYCL in brochures, price lists

and other publications as well as information available

online is subject to change without notice and merely an in-

vitation to submit an offer, unless expressly stated other-

wise. A contract comes into effect on the date of signing by

the parties or at the latest on the beginning of the use of the

service or the delivery of the product or third-party product.

If an order for services, products or third-party products is

placed verbally, it shall be confirmed in writing in any case

and shall be deemed legally valid if it is not revoked immedi-

ately after receipt of the confirmation by the business part-

ner. Offers are binding during the period specified by CYCL.

If not specified, the offer will remain valid for 30 days from

the date of the offer. The daily price applies to offers of third-

party products.



4 Prices, Fees, Rates and Terms of Payment



4.1 General Information



1. The business partner pays a price for the individual pro-

ducts, services and third-party products, which is specified

in the respective contracts, agreements and order confirma-

tions and/or price lists. If a service lasts longer than one

month, monthly invoices are issued. All prices and charges

are without any deduction, in Swiss francs. Value added

taxes and expenses (taxes, shipping and packaging costs,

insurance, etc.) will be charged to the business partner in

addition to the respective amount.



4.2 Fixed Prices



1. If the provision of a service at a fixed price is agreed in the

service description, this shall be based on the principles

known at the time of conclusion of the agreement. Should

these principles change significantly during the provision of

the service, and if this was not foreseeable for CYCL, CYCL

can demand an adjustment of the fixed price. Unless other-

wise agreed, CYCL will charge the fixed price at one third

when the order is placed, when the system is put into opera-

tion and when the system is accepted. All additional ser-

vices are invoiced monthly on a time and material basis.

Products from third party suppliers will be invoiced immedi-

ately upon receipt by the business partner.

4.3 Hourly Rates

applicable price matrix. For work in the evening or on week-

ends surcharges of 50% (Mon - Fri, 20:00 - 08:00, Fri, 20:00

- Sat, 20:00) or 100% (Sat, 20:00 - Mon, 08:00) are calcu-

lated.

in full by the date indicated on the invoice form under "Pay-

ment Agreements". Reasoned objections may be submitted

within this period, but not later than 30 days after the invoice

date. After the deadline, the invoice shall be deemed to

have been approved. If a business partner has neither paid

the invoice nor raised justified objections to it by the date

specified on the invoice form under payment agreements,

an interest of five percent (5 %) per year shall be owed from

the due date as well as the payment of reminder fees, with-

out any further notice of default being required. CYCL is en-

titled with delay of payment of the business partner to stop

its achievements without compensation without further re-

minder, to initiate the debt collection after warning and to let

a third party. Deductions from the invoice amounts to be

paid are neither permitted by offsetting against any counter-

claims nor for other reasons.



4.6 Extended Terms of Payment



1. CYCL can demand measures to secure its claims in the

form of advance payments, bank guarantees etc..



4.7 Price Changes

more than one year. Price changes are announced to the

business partner at least one month in advance.



5 Retention of Title



1. The products delivered by CYCL and third party products re-

main the property of CYCL or the third party supplier until

the complete receipt of the payment, and the business part-

ner is not entitled to resell or pledge them. The business

partner is obliged to cooperate in measures to protect the

property of CYCL or the third party supplier. The business

partner authorizes CYCL and/or the third party supplier to

enter the property in the corresponding register of retention

of title and to inform the landlord of the business premises of

the business partner of this. If the fee agreed with the busi-

ness partner is not paid within the payment period, CYCL is

entitled to charge the costs for the entry of the retention of

title to the business partner.



6 Dates and Delivery Times



1. Dates and delivery times are not binding unless expressly

agreed otherwise in writing. CYCL always strives to meet

the agreed deadlines. However, CYCL cannot assume any

liability for their compliance and the business partner is not

entitled to assert claims of any kind due to delays. A possi-

ble exceeding of deadlines does not entitle the business

partner to withdraw from the contract or to terminate it. The

indication of binding delivery times and delivery dates by

CYCL is subject to the correct and timely delivery by suppli-

ers and manufacturers. CYCL provides its services during

normal working hours, from Monday to Friday 9.00 - 17.00

(Business Hours), with the exception of local holidays at the

respective branch of CYCL.



7 Involvement of Third Parties



1. CYCL is entitled to involve third parties in the fulfilment of

the contract. CYCL is liable for the services of third parties

as for its own services.



8 Obligations of the Business Partner



1. The business partner is obliged to carry out all technical, op-

erational and personnel preparation and support actions in-

cumbent upon him in relation to the services to be provided

by CYCL correctly, on time and free of charge. In particular,

the business partner must provide the information and mate-

rial resources required for the performance of the service in

good time and grant CYCL the necessary access with re-

gard to the performance of the contract. The business part-

ner designates a contact person for CYCL who is exclu-

sively authorised to make decisions regarding all operational

matters of the services to be rendered and who has the nec-

essary time resources.



2. The business partner is obliged to follow all instructions of

CYCL concerning the use of hardware and software as well

as the use of CYCL systems and to take all reasonable

safety precautions (also for the protection of the devices

owned by CYCL).



3. The business partner shall ensure that products, services

and third-party products for which he has concluded a



contract with CYCL are used in accordance with the law and

the contract. He is obliged to comply with all statutory regu-

lations and assumes sole responsibility for the content of the

data available on his systems and storage media. CYCL de-

clines any liability in this respect. The business partner is

obliged to indemnify CYCL against all claims of any kind

which third parties may assert against CYCL in connection

with the use of the services of CYCL by the business part-

ner.



4. If the business partner does not fulfil his obligations de-

scribed above comprehensively or not in time, CYCL is not

responsible for a possible not contractual provision of ser-

vices. If delays or additional expenses arise, CYCL can de-

mand the adjustment of the agreed dates and the increase

of the remuneration. If the business partner does not fulfil

his obligations even after setting a reasonable grace period,

CYCL is also entitled to demand full compensation for the

damage incurred. The termination of the contract without

notice also remains reserved.



5. Operational regulations of the business partner, in particular

safety regulations, working time regulations and/or house

rules can only be observed if they are communicated to

CYCL in writing before the start of work.

9 Delivery, Inspection, Acceptance and Default of Ac-

ceptance



9.1 Supply of Poducts and Third-Party Products



1. The delivery takes place in principle at the discretion of

CYCL and at the risk and expense of the business partner.

Complaints about damage, loss or destruction during

transport must be addressed by the business partner di-

rectly to the transport company concerned. The business

partner must confirm receipt of the products by signing the

delivery note enclosed with the delivery. The business part-

ner must inspect the deliveries immediately upon receipt

and submit any complaints in writing within ten (10) days. If

he fails to do so, or if he uses the delivered products pro-

ductively, the delivery shall be deemed accepted. CYCL will

forward complaints to the respective third party supplier for

treatment.



9.2 Inspection and Acceptance of Services



1. The business partner has to check the services of CYCL im-

mediately after completion of the service provision or after

receipt of the notification of operational readiness and to re-

port any complaints or defects in writing within ten (10) days

at the latest. Insofar as CYCL bears responsibility for re-

sults, defects shall be remedied by CYCL in accordance

with the provisions in Section 14, Warranty. Other com-

plaints will be handled by CYCL at its own discretion. If the

business partner fails to inspect or accept the services in

good time, or if he/she takes them into operation before-

hand, they shall be deemed to have been approved and ac-

cepted. Minor defects that do not significantly impair the

business partner's operations shall not be an obstacle to ac-

ceptance.



9.3 Default of Acceptance



1. If the business partner is in default of acceptance, CYCL is

entitled to store hardware and software ordered or provided

by CYCL in connection with services at the expense and

risk of the business partner, to discontinue the provision of

services, and to withdraw from the contract after the unused

expiry of a reasonable grace period set for acceptance. In

this case, the business partner must pay for all services ren-

dered by CYCL and compensate CYCL for any damages in-

curred.



10 Intellectual Property



1. CYCL or its licensors remain owners of all intellectual prop-

erty rights in connection with the provision of services and of

all related documents and documentation. This also applies

if CYCL makes changes or enhancements. If agreed in writ-

ing, the business partner is entitled to a non-transferable

and non-exclusive right of use after complete payment of

the agreed remuneration for the work results, documents,

evaluations or programs created by CYCL within the scope

of the service descriptions. Programs provided to the busi-

ness partner may only be used on specifically designated

equipment and systems and only for its own purposes, but

may under no circumstances be reproduced, made availa-

ble to third parties or provided to third parties. The business

partner's authority to use standard software and documents

from third-party suppliers shall be governed by the provi-

sions of the third-party suppliers. The business partner un-

dertakes to comply with these provisions at all times.



2. CYCL reserves the right to terminate the contract without

notice for important reasons in the event of violations of use

or infringement of the intellectual property of CYCL, its licen-

sors or third party suppliers by the business partner. The as-

sertion of damages as well as the claim to restoration of the

lawful condition remain reserved.



11 Third-Party Property Rights



1. CYCL defends the business partner against all claims raised

against the business partner in connection with the provision

of services by CYCL due to infringement of a Swiss indus-

trial property right, provided that the business partner imme-

diately notifies CYCL of such claims in writing, and CYCL of-

fers and supports the exclusive conduct of any litigation and

all negotiations for the judicial or extrajudicial settlement of

the legal dispute.



2. If Swiss property rights of third parties have been infringed

or if this is probable in the opinion of CYCL, CYCL has the

choice either to provide the business partner with the right to

further use the services concerned, to replace them or to

modify them in such a way that the infringement of the prop-

erty rights no longer exists, or to take back these services

and to reimburse the business partner for the remuneration

paid by the business partner less appropriate compensation

for the use made. The business partner is not entitled to

other claims against CYCL in case of infringement of indus-

trial property rights.



3. CYCL is not liable for infringements of industrial property

rights if a claim arises from the use of services according to

the service description in connection with services (hard-

ware and software) which were not provided by CYCL, or if

an infringement of industrial property rights is attributable to

changes in the services provided by CYCL by the business

partner or third parties.



4. The provisions governing infringements of industrial prop-

erty rights by these suppliers shall apply to infringements of

industrial property rights by deliveries and services from

third party suppliers. CYCL is not liable for such injuries.



12 Non Disclosure



1. Both parties are obliged, even beyond the duration of the

contractual relationship, to keep secret all manufacturing

and business secrets made accessible to them as well as all

other confidential information, data and documents received

or perceived in connection with the submission of an offer,

the preparation of the performance of services, the contract

negotiations or the performance of the contract and to use

them only within the framework of the contractual relation-

ship.



13 Data Protection



1. The business partner undertakes to comply with all applica-

ble data security and data protection regulations. The Swiss

Data Protection Act applies to business relationships with

business partners at home and/or abroad. The disclosure of

confidential information to third parties requires the prior

written consent of the other party. Insofar as CYCL pro-

cesses personal data for the business partner, the business

partner is obliged to assume and fulfil his full responsibility

as the owner of this data at all times. In particular, he shall

also determine the purpose and means of the processing of

such data. CYCL is the sole processor of such data and

does not assume any data protection responsibilities for the

business partner as the owner of this data. CYCL has the

right to inspect and document all data and information of the

business partner for the purpose of ensuring legal use. The

business partner expressly declares his consent that CYCL

may transmit all non-confidential information and data con-

cerning the business partner abroad and process it compre-

hensively as well as use it or have it used.



14 Warranty



1. CYCL is responsible to the business partner for the careful

and contractual provision of its services. CYCL is only re-

sponsible for the results if this is explicitly specified. CYCL

cannot guarantee that the products or supported systems

supplied by it can be used uninterruptedly and faultlessly in

all desired combinations.



2. In addition, the warranty does not apply to defects and mal-

functions for which CYCL is not responsible, such as natural

wear and tear, coincidence, force majeure, improper treat-

ment, interference by the business partner or third parties,

excessive strain, unsuitable operating materials or extreme

environmental influences. The warranty does not apply, in

particular, if a defect is due to the influence of a third party

or a malfunction of the infrastructure used by the business

partner or if the business partner or third party intervenes in

hardware or software or manipulates or changes these with-

out the prior written consent of CYCL.



3. In the event of a warranty claim, CYCL will remedy any de-

fects at its own discretion (e.g. rectification of defects, re-

placement delivery). If CYCL cannot remedy the defects



within a reasonable period of time, the business partner is

entitled to a reduction in the remuneration paid for the ser-

vice concerned or, if the reduced value reaches the amount

of the remuneration paid, to reimbursement of the remuner-

ation less appropriate compensation for the use made

against return of the service concerned. Warranty claims

must be asserted in writing within 10 days of the occurrence

of a warranty claim, giving precise details of the defect and

the circumstances of its occurrence. Services of CYCL,

which go beyond the scope of the warranty claims of the

business partner, are provided by CYCL as far as possible

and invoiced according to the respectively valid price lists.



4. The warranty conditions and terms and conditions of third

party manufacturers apply exclusively to services and deliv-

eries.



15 Liability



1. CYCL is liable for damage to property and personal injury

up to a maximum amount of CHF 3,000,000, provided that

the damage is covered by CYCL's liability insurance and the

business partner proves that CYCL is at fault.



2. Any liability or obligation in connection with the provision of

services by CYCL for other damages, in particular indirect

damages, consequential damages such as loss of profit, un-

realized savings, additional expenses or claims of third par-

ties or loss of data as well as for damages from delayed de-

livery is expressly excluded within the framework of what is

legally permissible. Furthermore, CYCL is not liable for dam-

ages caused by accident, force majeure, third parties or

non-contractual acts.



3. The manufacturer's instructions apply to third-party prod-

ucts. CYCL declines any liability for claims arising from the

failure or faulty functioning of third-party products (e.g. ser-

vice costs for the renewed removal and installation of soft-

ware/hardware). CYCL undertakes to provide the business

partner with regular information on the progress of orders

and project work and to notify the business partner of any

circumstances which could jeopardise the fulfilment of the

contract. CYCL is in no way liable for the provision of ser-

vices by third party suppliers. CYCL can assert contractual

claims against third party suppliers in consultation with and

on account of the business partner.



16 Force majeure



1. If a party cannot fulfil its contractual obligations despite all

due care due to force majeure such as natural events of

particular intensity, warlike events, strike, unforeseeable offi-

cial restrictions, etc., the fulfilment of the contract shall be

postponed in accordance with the event that has occurred.



17 Export



1. The export of products which are subject to an export ban

by the Import and Export Department of the Federal Depart-

ment of Economic Affairs or corresponding foreign authori-

ties is prohibited. The business partner undertakes to com-

ply with such export bans.



18 Non-Solicitation Clause



1. During their contractual relationship and within the following

year, the parties undertake not to actively entice away any

employees or other contractually obliged persons of the

other party or offer them an employment relationship or en-

ter into a similar legal relationship with them. For each

breach of this obligation by a party and without any other

mutual agreement, it shall owe the other party in particular

the recruitment and training costs thereby incurred and a

contractual penalty in the amount of a gross annual salary of

the person concerned.



19 Changes and Termination



19.1 Amendments



1. If no special change process is provided for in the service

descriptions, the parties may at any time agree in writing on

changes to the service description. In all other respects

CYCL informs the business partner about changes of the

general terms and conditions, the order modalities, the con-

tracts and agreements in time. Changes entitle the customer

to terminate the contract within the ordinary period of notice.

Without notice within this period, the changes shall be

deemed to have been approved by the business partner.



19.2 Notice



1. Unlimited contracts can be terminated by either party in writ-

ing with one month's notice. In the case of fixed-term con-

tracts, the duration of the contract shall be tacitly extended

for a further year if the contract is not terminated by giving

one month's notice before the end of the contract period.

The parties reserve the right to make deviating agreements.

CYCL can cancel contracts without notice at any time by



notifying the business partner and/or discontinue its services

and deliveries if the business partner violates an essential

provision of the contract, undertakes or tolerates illegal or

offensive activities in connection with the use of the services

of CYCL, is in default with the payment of invoice amounts,

becomes insolvent, execution measures are taken against

him or otherwise his economic situation changes in such a

way that the rights of CYCL are at risk.

20 Partial Invalidity



1. Should individual provisions of these GTC be invalid or inef-

fective, this shall not affect the effectiveness of the remain-

ing provisions and the GTC as a whole. In such a case, the

parties shall endeavour to replace the invalid or contestable

provision with another valid and enforceable provision that

comes as close as possible to the legal and economic con-

tent of the invalid or contestable provision. The same ap-

plies to the filling of gaps in the contract.



21 Applicable law and place of jurisdiction



1. All legal relations between the business partner and CYCL

are subject to Swiss law. The exclusive place of jurisdiction

is Basel, Switzerland.



21 Prevailing Language



1. This English version of the GTC has been translated from

the German original. The German language version of the

GTC shall be controlling in all respects and shall prevail in

case of any inconsistencies with translated versions, if any.
