### Pay Attention. This is important.

Cotton Bureau respects your privacy and wants to give you a powerful online experience that you can trust. This Privacy Policy explains our information practices and how we process your information to provide our services. It refers to the Cotton Bureau Website (the "Website") and governs all of our data collection and usage policies. If you use or visit the Cotton Bureau Website, you are signifying to Cotton Bureau, Inc. ("Cotton Bureau") that you agree to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Collection of your Personal Information
---------------------------------------

When you create an account as a seller or customer, we must collect some of your personal information to provide, support, improve, and market our services. Some of the ways that we may collect personal information include information that you provide us directly; information about you that we automatically collect from log data, IP addresses, and aggregated user data; cookies; information that you give us about your friends; and your chat histories.

### Types of Information We Collect

We collect personal information regarding our users (collectively "Individuals").

**Account Information You Provide.** When you create an account on our Website, we collect your e-mail address. You also have the option to provide information in your profile, such as your name, home or work address and telephone number. When you place an order on the Website, we collect your name, shipping address and billing address and phone number. Your payment information is processed by our order processing partner and not by us.

**Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests.** We may run sweepstakes and contests. We ask those who enter in the sweepstakes or contests to provide contact information (e.g., an e-mail address). If you participate in a sweepstakes or contest, your contact information may be used to reach you about the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes. All sweepstakes/contests entry forms will provide a way for participants to opt out of any communications that are not related to awarding prizes.

**Demographic Data.** Cotton Bureau also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.

**Automatically Collected Information:** For maintenance, quality of service purposes, and for general statistics, our Website collects information about computer hardware and software automatically.
