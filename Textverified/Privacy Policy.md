Terms and Conditions
====================

Modification of Terms
---------------------

Textverified LLC reserves the right to modify any or all parts of these Terms and Conditions at any time, as per our discretion. Your acceptance to new Terms will become effective upon your continued use of our services. If you wish to terminate your acceptance of these Terms, or desire to cease using our services, you may simply discontinue using the Service.

Prohibited Activities
---------------------

Use of our services to engage in or promote illegal activities is strictly prohibited. Misuse of provided services will result in immediate discontinuation of all services indefinitely, regardless of payment status. We provide services only to individuals who are at or above 13 years of age. If any user is found to be under this age, we will immediately terminate all services and accounts associated with that user.

Accounts
--------

You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information upon establishment of account. You are responsible for maintaining adequate security measures and control of any and all usernames, passwords, or other information associated with your account. Furthermore, you are responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date at all times.

Creation of multiple accounts to avoid a ban from our services is not allowed, and will result in termination of all accounts created for such purposes.

Phone Numbers
-------------

Any phone numbers (or “numbers”) provided to you via our services are not your property or reserved strictly for your private use. Sharing these numbers to third parties is prohibited, considered a breach of these Terms, and may lead to immediate termination of your account.

By utilizing our services, you accept that the availability of numbers changes at our discretion, and that numbers may not be available at all times. You accept that the numbers we provide are temporary and subject to change at our discretion. We are not responsible for any incident(s) arising from your use of a number.

In addition, the Service we provide covers verifications only. We are not responsible for any incident(s) that occur outside of the verification process, which starts when you request a number for verification and ends when you receive a code. By using our service, you indemnify, defend and hold harmless us for, from and against any liability.

Purchases, Cancellation, and Refunds
------------------------------------

We accept a variety of payment methods, which may include Credit/Debit cards and certain Cryptocurrencies. We reserve the right to modify methods of payment at our discretion and may choose to discontinue certain methods at any time. You accept that you are required to purchase Textverified Credits with the prior methods in order to utilize our service. We are not responsible for any payments to incorrect parties (including but not limited to any entities imitating us) or incorrect payment amounts. We reserve the right to discontinue or modify available payment methods or prices of our credits at any time for any reason. Prices of all services purchased with our credits are subject to change at our discretion.

Textverified Credit or monetary refunds are assessed on a case by case basis. Purchases made via cryptocurrency may not be refunded. We reserve the right to deny a refund for any reason, including but not limited to, abuse of our service or violation of these Terms.

Cancellation of services is at the discretion of users, with the exception of account termination or banning due to misuse of services. We do not provide refunds to users who desire to cancel their use of services.

Delivery
--------

Delivery of services is provided immediately upon activation of user accounts and successful payment. No physical product is provided as part of the services provided. In case of failed delivery of services, users are responsible for contacting technical support to resolve the issue.

We may restrict delivery of services due to prior ban status or termination of account. Users should verify that their accounts are in good standing and that their accounts have not been terminated before attempting to access our services.

Warranties Disclaimer
---------------------

We make no warranties that the Service (1) will be continuously available or uninterrupted or (2) will be error free. We reserve the right to discontinue or modify any part of the Service at any time for any reason.

Severability Clause
-------------------

If any provision of these Terms is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, it shall not affect the enforceability of any other provision of these Terms. Rather, the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be modified so that it is valid, legal, and enforceable and to the fullest extent possible, reflects the intention of Textverified LLC.
