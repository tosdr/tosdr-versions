Last updated on January 26, 2024.

This Privacy Statement describes how Shutterstock manages personal data and personal information, and respects your privacy. This policy may be amended from time to time. We encourage visitors to and users of our sites to regularly review our Privacy Policy.

All "**Personal Information**" (which is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time. To update your information and preferences, see the section entitled ["Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences."](#anchor_updating_personal_information)

Shutterstock is made up of different legal entities. This privacy notice is issued on behalf of the Shutterstock group of companies. When we refer to "Shutterstock", "we", "us" or "our" in this privacy notice, we mean the Shutterstock entity that acts as the controller or processor of your information, as explained in more detail in the "Entities Collecting Personal Information" section below.

Collection of Personal Information
----------------------------------

As a visitor to the Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information.

However, when you register to use a Shutterstock site and license content, order products or services as a Shutterstock subscriber in order to provide the services to you, we may collect the following Personal Information from you:

* Contact information such as your name, phone number, address and email address; and
* Billing information such as the number, expiration date, card type and billing address of your credit card;
* Demographic information such as your job title, job description and company name and company type; and
* Profile data, including your username and password, details about your activity on the Site, including search terms, plan purchases and the Content that you license.

If you submit content to Shutterstock for licensing, you may be asked to provide the following information:

* Contact information such as your name, phone number, primary address, and email address.
* Payment and contributor information including, but not limited to, payout method, payout email, desired display name, profile information, social media accounts, and information about your skill level and creative process.

Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

As is true of most websites, when you use the Site, Shutterstock or third party subprocessors contracted by Shutterstock may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. Shutterstock also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. To better understand the needs of our visitors to the Site we may occasionally match such information with your Personal Information.

In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, and prevent abuse of our system, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submit to us with information from third-party sources. For example, we may supplement your contact information with address information provided by the Google Maps API or the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in our database. Where we use the Google Maps API, the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy) is incorporated by reference solely with regards to the personal information processed by Google. We may supplement the information that we collect directly from you with information stored in third-party databases, such as demographic information or company information in order to make it more likely that any marketing communications we send will be relevant and of interest to you. You may find a list of any third-party subprocessors that we use to process information [here](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hrltx12pl8hq/1RIgjm3KZN3NfMkw8ikeV9/d5115103acda89521ac11dadf3564b34/Shutterstock_List_of_Subprocessors_en_01_24.pdf).

When you download and use our Mobile Apps or Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, and operating system version. We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or Services.

Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies and trackers to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union click [here](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/)) Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.

Protection of Your Personal Information
---------------------------------------

The Personal Information that you provide in connection with the use of the Site is protected in several ways.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we take into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology to use these measures protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
