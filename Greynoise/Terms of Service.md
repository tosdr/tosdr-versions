### 2.1 Account registration

In order to establish an account and access the Platform, you will be asked to provide certain registration details, such as name, email address, phone number, and potentially other information. You agree that all information you provide to register an account with GreyNoise will be correct, current, and complete. Our collection and use of this information is governed by our Privacy Policy at https://greynoise.io/privacy. Upon your acceptance of this EULA and completion of the registration process, GreyNoise will provide you with an API key to access the Platform. You are responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Platform through your account (whether Authorized Users or not) or API key are aware of this EULA and comply with them.

### 2.2 Trial and other non-paid offerings

* Customer’s use of the Platform exceeds the scope of access set forth in Customer’s Quotation or constitutes abusive usage;
* there is a threat or attack on the Platform necessitating suspension, in which case GreyNoise will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice of any Platform suspension to Customer and to provide updates regarding resumption of access to the Platform following any suspension.

Either party may terminate your subscription, effective on written notice to the other party, if the other party materially breaches this EULA, and such breach: (A) is incapable of cure; or (B) being capable of cure, remains uncured ten (10) days after the non-breaching party provides the breaching party with written notice of such breach.

### 4.4 Effect of cancellation

No expiration or termination will affect your obligation to pay all Subscription Fees that may have become due before such expiration or termination, or entitle you to any refund.

5\. Confidentiality

During the term of your subscription, either party may disclose or make available to the other party information about its business affairs, products, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information, and other sensitive or proprietary information, whether orally or in written, electronic, or other form or media, and whether or not marked, designated or otherwise identified as “confidential” (collectively, “Confidential Information”). Customer Data is considered the Confidential Information of Customer. Confidential Information does not include information that, at the time of disclosure is: (a) in the public domain; (b) known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure; (c) rightfully obtained by the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a third party; or (d) independently developed by the receiving parties.

On the expiration or termination of your subscription, the receiving party shall promptly return to the disclosing party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the disclosing party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Each party’s obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire five years from the date first disclosed to the receiving party; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this EULA for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.
