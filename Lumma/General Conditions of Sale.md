Refund policy
=============

**ALL SALES ARE FINAL**  
  
Lumma Cups Menstrual Disc is a personal hygiene device so, unfortunately, **we can’t offer any kind of returns, or exchanges**. We currently have the Buy One Get One Free promo, so you can try ordering different sizes of the product and making sure which one is the best fit for you.

Remember it can take a little while to get the hang of using a menstrual disc, so please read our instruction in the ["How to Use"](https://www.lummacups.com/pages/how-to-use-menstrual-disc "How to Use") section of our website. Also visit our [blog](https://www.lummacups.com/blogs/news "Lumma Blog") to read a few tips from Lumma Cups about the products.

Our Facebook and Instagram accounts are also where you’ll find a huge Lumma Cups community. They’re always eager to offer tips and tricks and to welcome you to the new world of menstrual discs.

If you have any additional questions, please feel always free to reach us out at contact@lummacups.com

  
**ORDER CANCELLATIONS**  
  
Orders that haven’t processed can be cancelled. Please email contact@lummacups.com to find out if your order has processed, and if it has not, our team can make the cancellation for you. Our team is available during business  hours (EST) from Monday to Friday.

Please beware that orders are processed in the same business day or in the next business day if you ordered during weekends.
