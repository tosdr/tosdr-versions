2\. Security
------------

Company represents and covenants that it maintains appropriate administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect Customer data and personal information, including User Data (as defined in Section 4 below), to the extent reasonably necessary for the performance of the Services consistent with the Data Protection Addendum and all applicable laws and regulations.

3\. Support Services
--------------------

Company shall provide Customer with support services as specified in the Order (the “Support Services”).

4\. Ownership
-------------

(a) Ownership of the Service; Intellectual Property. Company shall retain all title to and ownership of and all proprietary rights with respect to the Services (including all software used to provide the Services and all portions thereof (including all derivatives or improvements thereof)), whether or not incorporated into or used with other software as a service, software or hardware. Customer’s use of the Services does not constitute a sale of any of such software or any portion thereof. Company’s name, logo, and the product names associated with the Services are trademarks of Company or third parties, and no right or licence is granted herein to use them. Company hereby grants Customer, solely during the term of this Agreement, a limited, royalty-free, revocable licence to use and install the Company provided software (which may include certificates and pack files) solely on Customer’s machines and devices and only as necessary or appropriate to receive the Services (the “Client Software”).

(b) Ownership of User Data. The Services may allow Customer to track and gather a range of data and information regarding its Users (“User Data”). Customer shall retain all title to and ownership of and all proprietary rights with respect to User Data and shall be solely responsible for its use thereof. Customer is also responsible for securing and backing up its User Data and Company shall only restore lost User Data to its last-backup point if the loss was due to a fault in Company’s Services or Support Services. Customer hereby grants Company a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive licence to access and use User Data for the sole purpose of enabling Company to provide the Services, and for the limited purposes set forth in the Data Protection section and Data Protection Addendum set out below.

(c) Ownership of Reports and Analyses. Company may provide Customer with certain reports and analyses as part of the Services (“Reports”). Company shall retain all title to and ownership of and all proprietary rights with respect to such Reports.

(d) Mobile App and Parent/Guardian Usage. Customer acknowledges that Users may need to download the Company’s mobile application from the relevant major mobile device provider app stores (iTunes or Google Play) and that use of the Company’s mobile application or website by parents/guardians is subject to Company’s terms of service and privacy policy.

(e) Feedback. If Customer provides any ideas, suggestions or recommendations to Company regarding Company’s software, products, services or technology (“Feedback”), such Feedback is provided on a non-confidential basis to Company and Company is free to retain, disclose, use and incorporate such Feedback in Company’s and/or its affiliates’ products and services, without payment of royalties or other consideration to Customer. Customer understands and agrees that Company is not obligated to use, display, reproduce, or distribute any such Feedback, and that it has no right to compel such use, display, reproduction, or distribution. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation on Customer to provide Feedback to Company.

5\. Data Protection
-------------------

Customer Personal Data (as defined within the Data Protection Addendum) shall be processed in accordance with the terms set forth in the Data Protection Addendum attached hereto as Exhibit A. For the purposes of Annex 2 (Standard Contractual Clauses) to Exhibit A (Data Protection Addendum), Customer is the “data exporter” and Securly is the “data importer” and by executing these terms and conditions, both parties shall be deemed to have signed and executed Annex 2 (Standard Contractual Clauses) to Exhibit A (Data Protection Addendum) in all relevant places. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of inconsistencies between the provisions of the Data Protection Addendum and any other agreements between the parties, including this Agreement, the provisions of the Data Protection Addendum shall prevail.

(a) The parties agree that Customer is an educational institution, that Company is a service provider to Customer, and that Company’s collection and use of the personally identifiable User Data of children under the legal age of adulthood (“Minor User Data”) is conducted on behalf of and with the authorization of Customer, in order to provide the Services requested by Customer.

(b) Customer expressly agrees that data relating to the Services that does not identify and cannot be used to identify any minor customer or any individual (“Aggregate Data”) is not Data or minor User Data and Securly may maintain and use such data for its own purposes as set forth in the Privacy Policy, provided it has implemented reasonable safeguards to prevent the re-identification of Aggregate Data.

6\. Customer Responsibilities, Warranties and Restrictions
----------------------------------------------------------

(a) Customer agrees that it shall not do any of the following: (i) modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services (including any Client Software), or in any way attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of any part of the Services (including any Client Software); (ii) access or use the Services (including any Client Software) in order to build a similar or competitive product or service or for the purposes of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Company; (iii) except as expressly stated herein, copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, download, display, post or transmit in any form or by any means any of the Services (including any Client Software); (iv) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services (and Customer shall make commercially reasonable endeavours to prevent unauthorized third parties from accessing the Services (including any Client Software)); or (v) exceed the permitted number of devices, active users or students, teachers, faculty and staff in a school or district, in each case as specified in an Order.

(b) Customer shall not (i) access or attempt to access the administrative interface of the Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Company in connection with the Services, unless otherwise agreed in writing or (ii) intentionally engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or any servers or networks that are connected to the Services).

(c) Customer is responsible for all activity occurring under Customers’ accounts for the Services by its authorized users. Customer shall notify Company within a commercially reasonable time of any unauthorized use of any user account or any unauthorized use of the Services. Customer may not access the Company Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees or provide incorrect information for an Order for purposes of reducing amounts payable to Company.

(d) Customer represents, covenants, and warrants that Customer will use the Services only in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations. Although Company has no obligation to monitor Customer’s use of the Services, Company may do so and may prohibit any use of the Services it reasonably believes may be (or is alleged to be) in violation of this Agreement or applicable laws and regulations.

(e) Customer represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) Customer has taken all actions, complied with all requirements, obtained all prior consents and reviews, and otherwise satisfied all prerequisites that may be necessary or appropriate to enable Customer to enter into and perform this Agreement in accordance with its terms and conditions; and (ii) the software for the Services provided under this Agreement will be treated as “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” under any applicable laws, regulations or rules.

(f) If Customer is a government entity, unit, agency, organization, entity or party (including a school or school district), then Customer further represents, warrants and covenants that there is no applicable law, regulation, rule, or other governmental requirement (A) which in any way restricts or limits the duty of Customer to fully perform and comply with all obligations of Customer as set forth in this Agreement, or (B) which impairs the rights of Company as set forth in this Agreement.

(g) If any software or documentation is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the United States Government, Customer agrees that such software or documentation is “commercial computer software” or “commercial computer software documentation” and that, absent a written agreement with Company to the contrary, Customer’s rights with respect to such software and documentation are, in the case of civilian agency use, Restricted Rights (as defined in FAR §52.227.19), and, if for DoD use, limited by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to DFARS §227.7202.

7\. Confidential Information
----------------------------

(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the course of performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices, processes, documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other material or information that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary or which otherwise would reasonably be expected to be kept confidential. Confidential Information shall also include: (i) the Discloser’s planned or existing computer systems and systems architecture, including computer hardware, computer software, source code, object code, documentation, methods of processing and operational methods; (ii) the Discloser’s customer lists, sales, profits, organizational structure and restructuring, new business initiatives and finances; (iii) the Discloser’s services and products, product designs, and how such products are administered and managed; and (iv) the Discloser’s User Data. Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information that: (1) is or becomes public through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2) is or becomes known to Recipient (either directly or rightfully through a third party) without an obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.

(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient shall hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose the Confidential Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless required by applicable law to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and obligations under this Agreement and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to its employees, contractors and other personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a bona fide need to know and who are under binding written obligations of confidentiality with Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information.

(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient shall not acquire any rights or licences therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Recipient shall return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential Information and any other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information (including all copies in any form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the termination of this Agreement. Within ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient will provide Discloser with a written certification, as signed by an officer or executive level employee of Recipient, certifying compliance with this Section 7.

(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms and conditions of this Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information by Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being required to post bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application by the Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object to the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an adequate remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason. Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to the Discloser, whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.

8\. Billing and Payment
-----------------------

The amount of the recurring fees associated with the use of the Services and the Support Services by Customer shall be as set forth in the Order (the “Fees”). Fees for Services may be charged based on the number of (i) devices or active Users, (ii) the number of students in a school or district, or (iii) students, teachers, faculty and staff in a school or district, as specified in an Order. Additionally, there may be other basis for calculating the Fees, as specified in the Order. The Fees exclude all applicable sales, use, and other taxes, fees, duties and similar charges (“Taxes”), and Customer will be responsible for payment of all such Taxes (other than taxes based on Company’s income) and any penalties or charges that accrue with respect to the non-payment of any Taxes as well as government charges, and all reasonable expenses and legal fees Company incurs collecting late amounts. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be payable in U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice, unless specified otherwise in the Order or Customer is purchasing the Services and Support Services through an authorized reseller and the parties have agreed that Customer is to pay the authorized reseller directly. Payment of fees shall be made by the Customer prior to receiving the Services. The payment may be made by cheque or wire transfer. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% per year) (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less).To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all (i) claims relating to charges unless claimed within sixty (60) days after invoicing, and (ii) refunds under any situations aside from those contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any fees for services posted on Company’s website or otherwise published by Company, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Fees may only be modified as set forth below in the “Modification; Waiver” section of this Agreement. If Customer is purchasing the Services or Support Services (or both) through an authorized reseller, Customer shall pay the fees for the Services and Support Services, as applicable, on a timely basis directly to the authorized reseller. Without limiting Company’s remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity, Company reserves the right to suspend provision of the Services or Support Services (or both) and to terminate this Agreement should Customer fail to pay the authorized reseller on time, regardless of the reason.

9\. Assignment
--------------

Company may assign to a third party (an “Assignee”) all of its right, title and interest in all or any of the Fees at any time. Upon any such assignment, Company will give Customer written notice thereof (a “Notice of Assignment”). The Notice of Assignment shall provide the name and contact information for the Assignee and shall instruct Customer to make payment of the assigned Fees to the Assignee. Upon receipt of a Notice of Assignment, (i) Customer shall sign the acknowledgement provision in such Notice of Assignment and return it to Company as provided in such Notice of Assignment and (ii) Customer shall be obligated to make all payments of the assigned Fees to the Assignee, notwithstanding the Order’s payment instructions for such Fees.

10\. Term and Termination
-------------------------

(a) This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms and conditions, shall remain in effect for the initial period specified in the Order (or, if no period is specified in the Order, then for an initial period of twelve (12) months) (the “Initial Term”). This Agreement will thereafter continue for successive twelve (12) month periods (each, a “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives the other party written notice of non-renewal at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term. The Initial Term, together with all Renewal Terms, are collectively referred to as the “Term”.

(b) Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party upon the occurrence of an Event of Default by the other party. For purposes of this Agreement, “Event of Default” means a breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement, if such breach remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice from the other party.

(c) Any and all provisions in this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to be performed after the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive and be enforceable after such termination or expiration, including without limitation provisions relating to confidentiality, ownership of materials, payment, taxes, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations of liability, effects of termination, and governing law.

11\. Company Warranties, Company Disclaimers, and Exclusive Remedies
--------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Company warrants to Customer that it will provide the Services in all material respects as described in the applicable end user documentation, if any, and will provide such Services in a professional manner and in accordance with generally accepted industry practices.

(b) Company does not guarantee that (a) the Services will be performed error-free or uninterrupted, or that company will correct all errors, (b) the Services will operate in combination with customer’s content or applications, or with any other hardware, software, systems, Services or data not provided by company, and (c) the Services will meet customer’s or its users’ needs, requirements, specifications, or expectations. Customer acknowledges that company does not control the transfer of data over communications facilities, including the internet, and that the Services may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of such communications facilities.

(d) For any breach of the Services warranty, Customer’s exclusive remedy and Company’s entire liability shall be the correction of the deficient Services that caused the breach of warranty, or, if Company cannot substantially correct the deficiency in a commercially reasonable manner (as determined solely by company in its reasonable discretion), then Customer may terminate the Services and Company will refund to Customer the fees for the terminated Services that Customer pre-paid to company for the period following the effective date of termination. In such an event, company shall also exercise commercially reasonable endeavours to provide Customer with reasonable opportunity to access the Services for the purposes of securing and backing up Customer’s User Data.

(e) To the extent not prohibited by law, these warranties, terms and conditions are exclusive and there are no other warranties, terms and conditions, and Company hereby disclaims and excludes all other warranties, terms and conditions whether statutory, express or implied, including any implied warranties, terms or conditions of satisfactory quality, non-infringement and fitness for a particular purpose.

Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and obligations under this Agreement and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to its employees, contractors and other personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a bona fide need to know and who are under binding written obligations of confidentiality with Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information.

(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient shall not acquire any rights or licences therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Recipient shall return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential Information and any other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information (including all copies in any form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the termination of this Agreement. Within ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient will provide Discloser with a written certification, as signed by an officer or executive level employee of Recipient, certifying compliance with this Section 7.

(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms and conditions of this Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information by Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being required to post bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application by the Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object to the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an adequate remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason. Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to the Discloser, whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.

7\. Confidential Information
----------------------------

(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the course of performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices, processes, documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other material or information that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary or which otherwise would reasonably be expected to be kept confidential. Confidential Information shall also include: (i) the Discloser’s planned or existing computer systems and systems architecture, including computer hardware, computer software, source code, object code, documentation, methods of processing and operational methods; (ii) the Discloser’s customer lists, sales, profits, organizational structure and restructuring, new business initiatives and finances; (iii) the Discloser’s services and products, product designs, and how such products are administered and managed; and (iv) the Discloser’s User Data. Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information that: (1) is or becomes public through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2) is or becomes known to Recipient (either directly or rightfully through a third party) without an obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.

(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient shall hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose the Confidential Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless required by applicable law to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and obligations under this Agreement and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to its employees, contractors and other personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a bona fide need to know and who are under binding written obligations of confidentiality with Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information.

(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient shall not acquire any rights or licences therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Recipient shall return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential Information and any other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information (including all copies in any form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the termination of this Agreement. Within ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient will provide Discloser with a written certification, as signed by an officer or executive level employee of Recipient, certifying compliance with this Section 7.

(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms and conditions of this Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information by Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being required to post bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application by the Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object to the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an adequate remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason. Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to the Discloser, whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.

8\. Billing and Payment
-----------------------

The amount of the recurring fees associated with the use of the Services and the Support Services by Customer shall be as set forth in the Order (the “Fees”).

If Customer is required by a governmental taxing authority to withhold an amount from any payment due hereunder and pay such amount to the governmental authority, the prices will be grossed-up so that the net payment equals the original price. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be payable in U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice, unless specified otherwise in the Order, or Customer is purchasing the Services and Support Services through an authorized reseller and the parties have agreed that Customer is to pay the authorized reseller directly. Payment of fees shall be made by the Customer prior to receiving the Services. The payment may be made by cheque or wire transfer. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% per year) (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less).To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all (i) claims relating to charges unless claimed within sixty (60) days after invoicing, and (ii) refunds under any situations aside from those contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any fees for services posted on Company’s website or otherwise published by Company, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Fees may only be modified as set forth below in the “Modification; Waiver” section of this Agreement. If Customer is purchasing the Services or Support Services (or both) through an authorized reseller, Customer shall pay the fees for the Services and Support Services, as applicable, on a timely basis directly to the authorized reseller. Without limiting Company’s remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity, Company reserves the right to suspend provision of the Services or Support Services (or both) and to terminate this Agreement should Customer fail to pay the authorized reseller on time, regardless of the reason.
