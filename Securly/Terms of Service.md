7\. Confidential Information
----------------------------

(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the course of performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices, processes, documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other material or information that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary or which otherwise would reasonably be expected to be kept confidential. Confidential Information shall also include: (i) the Discloser’s planned or existing computer systems and systems architecture, including computer hardware, computer software, source code, object code, documentation, methods of processing and operational methods; (ii) the Discloser’s customer lists, sales, profits, organizational structure and restructuring, new business initiatives and finances; (iii) the Discloser’s services and products, product designs, and how such products are administered and managed; and (iv) the Discloser’s User Data. Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information that: (1) is or becomes public through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2) is or becomes known to Recipient (either directly or rightfully through a third party) without an obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.

(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient shall hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose the Confidential Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless required by applicable law to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and obligations under this Agreement and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to its employees, contractors and other personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a bona fide need to know and who are under binding written obligations of confidentiality with Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information.

(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient shall not acquire any rights or licenses therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Recipient shall return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential Information and any other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information (including all copies in any form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the termination of this Agreement. Within ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient will provide Discloser with a written certification, as signed by an officer or executive level employee of Recipient, certifying compliance with this Section 7.

(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms of this Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information by Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being required to post bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application by the Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object to the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an adequate remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason. Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement. This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to the Discloser, whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.

7\. Confidential Information
----------------------------

(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the course of performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices, processes, documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other material or information that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary or which otherwise would reasonably be expected to be kept confidential.

Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information that: (1) is or becomes public through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2) is or becomes known to Recipient (either directly or rightfully through a third party) without an obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.

(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient shall hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose the Confidential Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless required by applicable law to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and obligations under this Agreement and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to its employees, contractors and other personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a bona fide need to know and who are under binding written obligations of confidentiality with Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information.

(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient shall not acquire any rights or licences therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Recipient shall return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential Information and any other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information (including all copies in any form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the termination of this Agreement. Within ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient will provide Discloser with a written certification, as signed by an officer or executive level employee of Recipient, certifying compliance with this Section 7.

(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms and conditions of this Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information by Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being required to post bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application by the Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object to the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an adequate remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason. Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to the Discloser, whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.

In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

7\. Confidential Information
----------------------------

(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the course of performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices, processes, documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other material or information that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary or which otherwise would reasonably be expected to be kept confidential. Confidential Information shall also include: (i) the Discloser’s planned or existing computer systems and systems architecture, including computer hardware, computer software, source code, object code, documentation, methods of processing and operational methods; (ii) the Discloser’s customer lists, sales, profits, organizational structure and restructuring, new business initiatives and finances; (iii) the Discloser’s services and products, product designs, and how such products are administered and managed; and (iv) the Discloser’s User Data. Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information that: (1) is or becomes public through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2) is or becomes known to Recipient (either directly or rightfully through a third party) without an obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.

(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient shall hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose the Confidential Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless required by applicable law to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event will Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary to exercise its rights and obligations under this Agreement and will ensure that Confidential Information is disclosed only to its employees, contractors and other personnel (individually and collectively, “Personnel”) with a bona fide need to know and who are under binding written obligations of confidentiality with Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information.

(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient shall not acquire any rights or licences therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Recipient shall return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential Information and any other information and materials that contain such Confidential Information (including all copies in any form) immediately upon Discloser’s written request, or upon the termination of this Agreement. Within ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request, Recipient will provide Discloser with a written certification, as signed by an officer or executive level employee of Recipient, certifying compliance with this Section 7.

(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms and conditions of this Section 7 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. Therefore, Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information by Recipient or any Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being required to post bond), including, but not limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application by the Discloser to protect and recover its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object to the entry of an injunction or other equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an adequate remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm or any other reason. Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to the Discloser, whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.

8\. Billing and Payment
-----------------------

The amount of the recurring fees associated with the use of the Services and the Support Services by Customer shall be as set forth in the Order (the “Fees”). Fees for Services may be charged based on the number of (i) devices or active Users, (ii) the number of students in a school or district, or (iii) students, teachers, faculty and staff in a school or district, as specified in an Order. Additionally, there may be other basis for calculating the Fees, as specified in the Order.

If Customer is required by a governmental taxing authority to withhold an amount from any payment due hereunder and pay such amount to the governmental authority, the prices will be grossed-up so that the net payment equals the original price. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be payable in U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice, unless specified otherwise in the Order, or Customer is purchasing the Services and Support Services through an authorized reseller and the parties have agreed that Customer is to pay the authorized reseller directly. Payment of fees shall be made by the Customer prior to receiving the Services. The payment may be made by cheque or wire transfer. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% per year) (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less).To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all (i) claims relating to charges unless claimed within sixty (60) days after invoicing, and (ii) refunds under any situations aside from those contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any fees for services posted on Company’s website or otherwise published by Company, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Fees may only be modified as set forth below in the “Modification; Waiver” section of this Agreement. If Customer is purchasing the Services or Support Services (or both) through an authorized reseller, Customer shall pay the fees for the Services and Support Services, as applicable, on a timely basis directly to the authorized reseller. Without limiting Company’s remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity, Company reserves the right to suspend provision of the Services or Support Services (or both) and to terminate this Agreement should Customer fail to pay the authorized reseller on time, regardless of the reason.

Company may assign to a third party (an “Assignee”) all of its right, title and interest in all or any of the Fees at any time. Upon any such assignment, Company will give Customer written notice thereof (a “Notice of Assignment”).

Upon receipt of a Notice of Assignment, (i) Customer shall sign the acknowledgement provision in such Notice of Assignment and return it to Company as provided in such Notice of Assignment and (ii) Customer shall be obligated to make all payments of the assigned Fees to the Assignee, notwithstanding the Order’s payment instructions for such Fees.

Customer shall defend Company against any claim, cause of action, suit or proceeding (each a “Claim”) made or brought against Company by a third party arising out of or attributable to Customer’s use of the Service (other than as expressly set forth in Section 12(b) below), and shall indemnify Company for any settlements or damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable legal fees incurred by, Company in connection with the Claim, on condition that Company (a) promptly gives Customer written notice of the Claim; (b) gives Customer sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (provided that Customer may not settle any Claim unless the settlement unconditionally release Company of all liability); and (c) provides reasonable assistance in connection with the defense (at Customer’s reasonable expense).

(b) Company Obligations. Company shall defend Customer against any Claim made or brought against Customer by a third party alleging that Customer’s use of the Service infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party, and shall indemnify Customer for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable legal fees incurred by, Customer in connection with the Claim, on condition that Customer (a) promptly gives Company written notice of the Claim; (b) gives Company sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (provided that Company may not settle any Claim unless the settlement unconditionally release Customer of all liability); and (c) provides reasonable assistance in connection with the defense (at Company’s reasonable expense).
