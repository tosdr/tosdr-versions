**1\. Terms**
-------------

Welcome to Niantic. We publish real-world augmented reality mobile experiences, including mobile game applications (“**Apps**“). Please read these Niantic Terms of Service and any applicable App guidelines (the “[**Guidelines**](https://nianticlabs.com/gameresources)” and, collectively, “the **Terms**”), because the Terms govern your use of such Apps. The Terms also govern your interaction with any websites we own or operate (“**Sites**”), purchase of any Niantic merchandise, participation in Niantic live events or promotions (“**Events**”), and more generally your use of any Niantic products or services (together with Apps, the “**Services**”).

Some exceptions to the Terms may apply based on your country of residence - please see the country-specific sections below. Niantic may also provide products and services which are governed by separate terms.

If you live in the United States, these Terms are entered into between you and Niantic, Inc., 1 Ferry Building Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94111. If you live in any other country, these Terms are entered into between you and Niantic International Limited, a company registered to do business under the laws of the United Kingdom. Niantic, Inc. and Niantic International Limited are collectively referred to as “Niantic” or “we” in these Terms.

By using the Services, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services. Niantic may modify these Terms at any time, and if we do, we will notify you by posting the modified Terms on the Site or in the App. It’s important that you review any modified Terms before you continue using the Services. If you continue to use the Services, you are bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services.

PLEASE BE AWARE THAT SECTION 13 CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND NIANTIC. AMONG OTHER THINGS, SECTION 13 INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WHICH REQUIRES, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. SECTION 13 ALSO CONTAINS A CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. PLEASE READ SECTION 13 CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WITHIN 30 DAYS: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION; AND (2) YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

If you are a user in the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), the United Kingdom, or any other country that does not allow such arbitration agreement, the above notice does not apply to you.

If you breach these Terms we may take action against you, including but not limited to terminating your account. You acknowledge that Niantic has no obligation to, and will not, reimburse or refund you for Services lost due to involuntary suspension or termination of your account.

**2\. Privacy**
---------------

Our Services are designed to enable you to interact in shared game worlds blended with information from the real world. To provide the Services, we need information about you, and we only use your information where we have a legal basis to do so. Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.nianticlabs.com/privacy/) to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have when you use our Services.

**3\. Use of the Services**
---------------------------

### _3.1 Cheating_

Niantic prohibits cheating, and we constantly take steps to improve our anti-cheat measures. Cheating includes any action that attempts to or actually alters or interferes with the normal behavior or rules of a Service. Cheating includes, but is not limited to, any of the following behavior, on your own behalf or on behalf of others:

* Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software);
* Playing with multiple accounts for the same Service;
* Sharing accounts;
* Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device’s location (for example through GPS spoofing); and/or
* Selling or trading accounts.

Apps may not work on devices that Niantic detects or reasonably suspects to be cheating, and Niantic will not provide support to players who attempt to cheat. You agree that Niantic may employ any lawful mechanisms to detect and respond to cheating, fraud, and other behavior prohibited under these Terms, including checking your device for the existence of exploits or hacking and/or unauthorized software. Please see the [Guidelines](https://nianticlabs.com/gameresources) and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.nianticlabs.com/privacy/) for more information.

### _3.2 Safe and Appropriate Use_

While you are using our Services, please be aware of your surroundings, and play and communicate safely. You agree that your use of the Services is at your own risk, and that you will not use the Services to violate any applicable law, regulation, Event policies, or instructions as outlined in these Terms and you will not encourage or enable any other individual to do so.

Further, you agree that in conjunction with your use of the Services you will not make available any unlawful, inappropriate, or commercial Content (defined below). You agree that you will not submit inaccurate, misleading, or inappropriate Content, including data submissions, edits, or removal requests.

Niantic does not intend Apps to be medical or health devices, or provide medical or health advice.

### _3.3 Your Interactions with Other People_

You agree that in conjunction with your use of the Services, you will maintain safe and appropriate contact with other players and other people both on our Services and in the real world. You will not harass, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights of others. You will not trespass, or in any manner attempt to gain or gain access to any property or location where you do not have a right or permission to be, and will not otherwise engage in any activity that may result in injury, death, property damage, nuisance, or liability of any kind. If you have a dispute with any third party relating to your use of Services, you release Niantic (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and employees) from all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

### _3.4 Eligibility and Account Registration_

If you want to use certain Services, you will have to create an account with us (an “**Account**“), and you will also need access to a supported mobile phone and an Internet connection. The help centers at [Niantic Game and App Resources](https://nianticlabs.com/gameresources) contain a list of supported devices. We do not support rooted or jailbroken devices.

You can create an Account using (a) your pre-existing Google account; (b) your pre-existing Facebook account, (c) a [Niantic Kids](https://parents.nianticlabs.com/) account, or (d) such other third-party accounts that we support, as selected by you on the App account creation screen.

You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and you will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. Niantic takes its account security obligations seriously; however, you are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them. Niantic is not responsible for any losses or harm you may suffer as a result of an unauthorized person accessing your Account and/or using your login in connection with our Services.

### _3.5 Account Suspension or Termination_

We may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you, including if (a) you fail to comply with these Terms; (b) we suspect fraud, cheating, or misuse by you of Content or Services; or (c) we suspect any other unlawful activity associated with your Account. If your Account is inactive (i.e., not used or logged-into) for a period of time, we will notify you via the Services or in the App prior to termination of your Account.

You may terminate your Account at any time by visiting the App [help centers](https://nianticlabs.com/gameresources). Upon termination of any Services or your Account, the following provisions of these Terms will survive: Content Ownership, Rights Granted by You, Disclaimer of Warranties, Indemnity, Limitation of Liability, Dispute Resolution, General Terms and this sentence on Termination.

### _3.6 Who May Use Our Services_

Unless stated otherwise for a particular Service, children are not allowed to use the Services. A “Child” is defined as follows: (a) residents of the EEA: anyone under 16 years old, or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data in your country of residence, (b) residents of the Republic of Korea, anyone under 14 years old, (c) residents of other regions: anyone under 13 years old or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data in that region [Niantic Game and App Resources](https://nianticlabs.com/gameresources) contains information on the age requirement for each of our Apps.

For Services that permit Child participation, parents or legal guardians (“**Parents**“) must provide verified consent. Parents can provide and verify their consent through the [Niantic Kids Parent Portal](https://parents.nianticlabs.com/), or through another authorized third-party provider made available through the Service. Where Parental consent is required, Niantic recommends that Parents monitor the Child’s online activity and use of the Service.

The verification and consent process for Children is performed by one of several third-party providers (“**Verification Provider**“). The Parent must register with the Verification Provider before a Child may use the Services. The Verification Provider will ask the Parent to verify their identity and to consent to the creation of an Account for the Child. Upon receipt of Parent verification and consent, the Verification Provider will enable the Parent to create an Account for the Child. Parental consent applies exclusively to the Service for which it has been granted.

A Parent who wishes to rescind their previously-provided consent to a Child’s access to and use of the Services should follow the instructions for Account deletion, which can be found in the respective help centers [here](https://nianticlabs.com/gameresources).

Purchases made through the Services are limited to Account holders who either (a) are the age needed to consent to a contract in their country of residence; or (b) if younger, have the consent of a Parent to use the Service. Parents can consult their device settings for the App to restrict in-App purchases by a Child, and should also monitor activity in their Child’s Account, including the purchase of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NIANTIC DECLINES ANY RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING ANY ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY A CHILD WITH OR WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A PARENT. IF YOU ARE A PARENT AND YOU GIVE YOUR PERMISSION FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER FOR ONE OF THE SERVICES, YOU THEREBY AGREE TO THE TERMS RELATING TO USE OF THE SERVICES BY YOUR CHILD.

**4\. Limited License to Use**
------------------------------

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Niantic grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicenseable license to download and install a copy of the Apps on a mobile device and to run such copy of the Apps solely for your own personal non-commercial purposes. Except as expressly permitted in these Terms or under applicable law, you may not: (a) copy, modify, or create derivative works based on the Apps; (b) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, or rent the Apps to any third party; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Apps; or (d) make the functionality of the Apps available to multiple users through any means. Niantic reserves all rights in and to the Apps not expressly granted to you under these Terms.

**5\. Content and Content Rights**
----------------------------------

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Niantic grants you a personal, noncommercial, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, revocable, limited license to download, view, display, and use the Content solely for your permitted use within the Services. “**Content**“ means the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, communications, interactive features, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are generated, provided, or otherwise made available through the Services, including User Content. “**User Content**” means any Content a user of a Service provides to be made available through Services.

### _5.1 Content Ownership_

Niantic does not claim ownership rights in User Content and nothing in these Terms restricts any rights that you may have to use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the foregoing, Niantic and its licensors exclusively own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services and Content, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark, or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services or Content.

### _5.2 Rights Granted by You_

By making any User Content available through the Services you grant to Niantic a nonexclusive, transferable, sublicenseable, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license (or, if not permitted under applicable law, a license for the whole duration, including for any extension thereof, of all relevant rights under any applicable law), to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, publicly display, publicly perform, market, promote and distribute your User Content in connection with operating and providing the Services and Content to you and to others. By accepting these terms, you allow Niantic to benefit freely from the above rights, including but not limited to:

1. The right to reproduce User Content by any means and in any form.
2. The right to publicly or privately broadcast or make available the User Content (or any product incorporating the User Content), in return for payment or free of charge in all places by any means or process known or unknown at the present time, and in particular via Internet, pay per view, pay per play, theatrical or television broadcasting, DVD, and print.
3. The right to use the User Content for demonstration, promotion and advertising for all Niantic Services.
4. The right to produce or order the production of any new product or service from the User Content or from any product incorporating or exploiting the User Content, either reproduced as it stands or modified by Niantic or by any outside party of its choice.

You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by Niantic on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you also agree that you will not exercise your moral rights (or equivalent rights under applicable laws), such as your right to be identified as the author of any of the User Contents, against Niantic or any third party designated by Niantic.

### _5.3 Trading_

Certain Apps permit Account holders to capture and trade virtual items, including but not limited characters or other items (“**Trading Items**“), during gameplay. Unlike Virtual Money and Virtual Goods, Trading Items are obtained at no additional charge during gameplay. Trading Items are a category of Content, and you acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights in or to Trading Items and that Trading Items do not have monetary value. Trading Items may be traded with other Account holders for other Trading Items, but Trading Items can never be sold, transferred, or exchanged for Virtual Money, Virtual Goods, “real” goods, “real” money, or “real” services, or any other consideration from us or anyone else.

You agree that you will only obtain Trading Items from other Account holders and through means provided by Niantic, and not through any third-party platform, broker, or other mechanism, unless expressly authorized. Any such sale, transfer, or exchange (or attempt to do so) is prohibited and may result in the termination of your Account or cancellation of such Trading Items. All Trading Items and other Content are provided “as is,” without any warranty, except where prohibited under applicable law.

### _5.4 Virtual Money and Virtual Goods_

Certain Apps permit the purchase of virtual currency (“**Virtual Money**“), specific to each App, and use of that Virtual Money to purchase virtual items or services expressly available for use in the respective Apps (“**Virtual Goods**”). Virtual Money is a category of Content. You may access and purchase Virtual Goods for your personal, non-commercial use of the Services. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights in or to the Virtual Money or Virtual Goods. Any balance of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money does not reflect any stored value and you agree that Virtual Money and Virtual Goods have no monetary value and do not constitute currency or property of any type. Virtual Money may be redeemed only for Virtual Goods and can never be sold, transferred, or exchanged for “real” money, “real” goods, or “real” services from us or anyone else. You agree that you will only obtain Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods from us and through means provided by us, and not from any third party unless expressly authorized. When you purchase Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods from an authorized third party, Niantic is not a party to the transaction and your purchase will be governed by the third party’s payment terms and conditions. Please review the applicable third party’s terms of service for additional information. Once you acquire a license to Virtual Money or Virtual Goods, you may not transfer them to another individual or account. Any such sale, transfer, or exchange (or attempt to do so) is prohibited, is a violation of these Terms and may result in cancellation of such Virtual Money or Virtual Goods or the termination of your Account.

During the term of your license to your Virtual Money, you may redeem your Virtual Money for selected Virtual Goods. As set forth below, all Virtual Money, Virtual Goods, and other Content is provided “as is,” without any warranty. You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Money and Virtual Goods are final and that we will not permit exchanges or refunds for any unused Virtual Money or Virtual Goods once the transaction has been made.

Generally, we have the right to offer, modify, eliminate, and/or terminate Virtual Money, Virtual Goods, the Content, and/or the Services, or any portion thereof, at any time, without notice or liability to you. If we discontinue the use of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods, we will provide you with reasonable advance notice by posting a notice through the Services or through other communications.

### _5.5 Feedback_

You can submit feedback, comments, and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“**Feedback**“) by reaching out to us on social media or support channels. Feedback is a form of User Content.

### _5.6 Intellectual Property Policy_

Niantic respects intellectual property rights and expects its users to do the same. It is Niantic’s policy to remove content that infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights, and Niantic reserves the right to terminate Accounts that engage in repeat infringement. Niantic complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and will respond to a valid claim of copyright infringement in accordance with the DMCA process. Please see Niantic’s [Intellectual Property Policy](https://www.nianticlabs.com/copyright/en/) for further information.

**6\. Conduct, General Prohibitions, and Niantic’s Enforcement Rights**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and User Content while using the Services, and for any consequences thereof. In addition, you agree not to do any of the following, unless applicable law mandates that you be given the right to do so:

* collect, store or share any personally identifiable information of other users from the Services without their express permission;
* extract, scrape, or index the Services or Content (including information about users or gameplay);
* use the Services or Content, or any portion thereof, for any commercial purpose or in a manner not permitted by these Terms, including but not limited to (a) gathering in-App items or resources for sale outside the Apps, (b) performing services in the Apps in exchange for payment outside the Apps, or (c) selling, reselling, or renting the Apps or your Account;
* attempt to access or search the Services or Content or download Content from the Services through the use of any technology or means other than those provided by Niantic or other generally available third party web browsers (including without limitation automation software, bots, spiders, crawlers, data mining tools, or hacks, tools, agents, engines, or devices of any kind);
* attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any of the software used to provide the Services or Content;
* bypass, remove, deactivate, descramble, or otherwise circumvent any technological measure implemented by Niantic or any of Niantic’s providers or any other third party (including another user) to protect the Services or Content;
* use, display, mirror, or frame the Services or any individual element within the Services, Niantic’s name, any Niantic trademark, logo, or other proprietary information, or the layout and design of any page or App without Niantic’s express written consent;
* post, publish, submit, store, or transmit any Content that infringes, misappropriates, or violates a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights, or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy;
* access, tamper with, or use nonpublic areas of the Services, Niantic’s computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Niantic’s providers;
* attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any Niantic system or network or Service, or breach any security or authentication measures;
* use any meta tags or other hidden text or metadata utilizing a Niantic trademark, logo, URL, or product name without Niantic’s express written consent;
* forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or newsgroup posting, or in any way use the Services or Content to send altered, deceptive, or false source identifying information;
* interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, the access of any user, host, or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mailbombing the Services;
* delete, obscure, or in any manner alter any attribution, warning, or link that appears in the Services or the Content;
* violate any applicable law or regulation; or
* encourage or enable any other individual to do any of the foregoing.

Although Niantic is not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Services or Content or to review or edit any Content, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Services, to ensure compliance with these Terms, and to comply with applicable law or other legal requirements. We reserve the right to remove or disable access to any Content, at any time and without notice. Niantic may remove any Content we consider to be objectionable or in violation of these Terms. We have the right to investigate violations of these Terms or conduct that affects the Services. We may also consult and cooperate with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users and others who violate the law.

ANY ATTEMPT BY YOU TO DISRUPT OR INTERFERE WITH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION UNDERMINING OR MANIPULATING THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF ANY SITE OR APP, IS A BREACH OF NIANTIC’S TERMS AND MAY BE A BREACH OR VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS.

**7\. Participation in Events**
-------------------------------

### _7.1 Event Registration and Tickets_

The term “**Event(s)**“ means any in-person event, gathering, activity or the like which is directly organized, hosted, or managed by Niantic, and any Promotion (as defined below). By registering or, where required, purchasing tickets (including any optional add-on purchases of additional gameplay experiences and/or physical merchandise) for an Event, you represent and warrant that the information you provide is true and accurate. If you are registering or purchasing tickets on behalf of others, you represent and warrant you have all necessary rights and consents to register and provide this information for others.

Subject to applicable law and the exceptions set forth in these Terms, no refunds or exchanges of Event tickets (including any add-on purchases) are permitted and tickets are non-transferable. Reasonably acceptable proof of identity, for example a driver’s license or passport, showing the same first and last name as those provided at time of prior registration, may be required to access an Event. Actual or attempted resale of tickets subjects them to revocation without refund. Tickets obtained from unauthorized sources may be invalid, lost, stolen, or counterfeit and may not be honored. Tickets cannot be replaced if lost, stolen or destroyed. Commercial use of tickets is prohibited without written approval from Niantic. Tickets are not redeemable for cash or credit. You agree to abide by any published ticket limits or restrictions, and orders exceeding or violating these restrictions are subject to cancellation without notice or refund. Events may have limited space and/or availability and Niantic does not guarantee your ability to purchase a ticket or attend an Event.

Unless otherwise prohibited under applicable law, by attending an Event you acknowledge that Niantic will use your data collected pursuant to the [Privacy Policy](https://www.nianticlabs.com/privacy/) for providing Event features (both in person and online), **including contacting you and giving you updates about the Event, mailing you required materials (e.g., a QR wristband), providing emergency or severe weather notifications, or public Event leaderboards and gameplay competitions.**

### _7.2 Event Conduct and Policies_

You shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and any rules and policies provided by Niantic or any other authorized party involved in creating or delivering the Event, including all health and safety policies and procedures and all reasonable instructions of the venue staff and Niantic representatives at the Event. As a condition of participation, you agree to comply with all policies on the Sites, including, without limitation, any applicable Event website and the [Niantic Live Event Code of Conduct](https://nianticlabs.com/live-event-coc).

Illicit drugs, controlled substances, contraband, weapons and illegal items are prohibited at Events. You agree and consent to reasonable security precautions and search on entry. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you waive and release Niantic and any other party involved in creating or delivering the Event from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, losses, expenses or liability which may arise out of, result from, or relate in any way to such security precautions and/or searches. If you elect not to consent to such security precautions and searches, you may be denied entry, or removed from, an Event without refund or other compensation.

Niantic and its authorized third parties reserve the right to refuse admission to, or to remove from an Event without refund or compensation of any kind, any person that (a) does not comply with these Terms, (b) engages in disorderly conduct or willful misconduct,(c) engages in harassing, threatening, abusive or otherwise inappropriate behavior towards Niantic employees, event staff or other event attendees, or (d) Niantic or its authorized third parties believe will cause a negative effect on the Event, participants, spectators, and/or personnel.

Any minor attending an Event must be accompanied by a Parent.

### _7.3 Assumption of Risks_

Unless prohibited by applicable law, you agree that by purchasing tickets to, participating in or attending an Event, you willingly, knowingly and voluntarily assume any and all risks occurring before, during or after the Event, including injury by any cause and damage, loss, or theft of property. You acknowledge that Events, and certain activities at Events, have inherent and unforeseen risks, including but not limited to (a) contact or collision with persons or objects, (b) obstacles (e.g., natural and man-made water, road and surface hazards), (c) equipment related hazards (e.g., broken, defective or inadequate equipment, unexpected equipment failure), (d) weather related hazards, (e) inadequate first aid and/or emergency measures, (f) judgment and/or behavior related problems (e.g., erratic or inappropriate participant, co-participant, or spectator behavior or errors in judgment by personnel at the Event), and (g) natural hazards (e.g., uneven or difficult terrain, wildlife and insects, contact with plants). You agree to take reasonable precautions before attending or participating in an Event and its activities, for example consulting with a personal physician and ensuring you are in good physical health, wearing appropriate attire, and bringing necessary or recommended supplies. You further understand and acknowledge it is your responsibility to inspect the Event grounds, facilities, equipment and areas to be used, and that by participating in the Event, you acknowledge the Event grounds, facilities, equipment, and areas to be used are safe, adequate, and acceptable for participation. If you believe or become aware of any unsafe conditions or unreasonable risks, you agree to immediately notify appropriate personnel and cease participation in the Event.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, you hereby waive and release Niantic and any other party involved in creating or delivering the Event from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, losses, expenses or liability which may arise out of, result from, or relate in any way to your attendance or participation in an Event, including for negligence, inherent and unforeseen risks, injury or damage to persons or property and the actions of third parties or Event participants and spectators.

### _7.4 Event Features and Cancellation_

Subject to applicable law, all schedules and any live or in-game experiences, activities, goods, services, perks, items, rewards and/or Content (collectively “**Event Features**“) advertised in connection with an Event are not guaranteed and are subject to change and/or cancellation at any time prior to or during an Event without notice or compensation of any kind. Admittance to an Event does not guarantee any specific Event Features while at the Event.

Event date, time and/or location are subject to change at any time, and Niantic will make a commercially reasonable effort to notify you in advance of any material changes. If an Event is canceled, suspended, or rescheduled and you are not able to attend, you will not be entitled to any compensation other than a refund of the ticket price at its face value with no further liability or compensation from Niantic or any other party. Any travel or accommodation costs incurred are entirely your responsibility.

### _7.5 Recordings and Use of Likeness_

You consent to and approve of Niantic’s recording of your image, likeness, name, dialogue, biographic information, personal characteristics, and voice at Events and the royalty free use of this information subject to the same “Rights Granted by You” above. Niantic may publish the results of any competitions (including rankings and any winners), gameplay statistics, and pictures of participants in promotional and marketing materials and on social media in accordance with these Terms.

**8\. Sweepstakes, Contests, Raffles, Surveys And Similar Promotions**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Periodically, Niantic and/or its partners may organize sweepstakes, contests, raffles, surveys, games, and similar promotions on the Services (each a “**Promotion**“). In addition to these Terms, Promotions will be subject to particular terms which we shall communicate to you at the time of these Promotions (“**Promotional Terms**”). By participating in any Promotion, you will become subject to those Promotional Terms. All Promotional Terms are incorporated into, may vary from, and shall supercede these Terms. Niantic urges you to read the Promotional Terms. Our Privacy Policy, in addition to these Terms and any Promotional Terms, governs any information you submit in connection with such Promotions.

**9\. Beta Programs**
---------------------

Niantic may offer you early access to certain pre-release mobile application software (“**Beta Software**“) in order to allow you to test and provide feedback on Beta Software as part of Niantic’s beta testing program (“**Beta Program**”). **This Section only applies to closed Beta Programs, where Niantic offers private access to selected testers. This Section does not apply to open betas that Niantic makes publicly available on an app store.**

You acknowledge that any product features or content, game documentation, promotional materials and/or any other information that Niantic may provide to you in connection with the Beta Program (“**Test Materials**“), the Beta Software, as well as everything related to the Beta Program is the exclusive property of Niantic, is confidential, and should be treated as confidential until such time as Niantic releases it.

If Niantic offers you access to the Beta Software, then, subject to your compliance with these Terms, Niantic grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited license to use the Beta Software solely for the purposes of testing and providing feedback on the Beta Software as part of the Beta Program.

Without limiting the foregoing and except as prohibited under applicable law, the following are prohibited and you may not:

* copy, modify, or create derivative works based on the Beta Software;
* give or sell the Beta Software to anyone;
* reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, decrypt or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Beta Software;
* install the Beta Software on systems you don’t directly control or that you share with others;

**13\. Arbitration Agreement**
------------------------------

### _13.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement_

If you live in the US or another jurisdiction which allows you to agree to arbitration, you and Niantic agree that any disagreement, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services or of the Sites, any products sold or distributed through the Sites, the Services, or the Terms and prior versions of the Terms (each, a “**Dispute**”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (a) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (b) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (the action described in this clause (b), an “**IP Protection Action**“). Notwithstanding this Arbitration Agreement, each of us may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to stop and/or seek compensation for the intentional or willful misuse or abuse (e.g. hacking or falsifying location) of its IP addresses, products, and Services. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of these Terms as well as claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.

### _13.2 Informal Dispute Resolution_

There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Niantic. If that occurs, Niantic is committed to working with you to reach a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial resolution. You and Niantic agree to participate in good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes before starting an arbitration or initiating an action in small claims court (“**Informal Dispute Resolution**”). You and Niantic agree that as part of these efforts, either party has the option to ask the other to meet and confer telephonically (“**Informal Dispute Resolution Conference**”). To initiate Informal Dispute Resolution, a party must give notice in writing to the other party (“**Notice**”). Such Notice to Company that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to [termsofservice@nianticlabs.com](mailto:termsofservice@nianticlabs.com) or regular mail to our offices located at 1 Ferry Building, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94111. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of the Dispute. Niantic will send a Notice and a description of the Dispute to your email address or regular address associated with your Account. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information up to date. The Informal Dispute Resolution process lasts 45 days and is a mandatory precondition to commencing arbitration. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties otherwise agree. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you must also personally participate. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in Informal Dispute Resolution.

### _13.3 Waiver of Jury Trial_

**YOU AND NIANTIC HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.** You and Niantic are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in subsection 13.1 above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

### _13.4 Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief_

**EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE.** Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the subsection below entitled “Batch Arbitration.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this subsection, “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Niantic agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the courts specified in subsection 13.10 below. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Niantic from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

### _13.5 Arbitration Rules and Forum_

The Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution does not resolve the Dispute in a satisfactory manner within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a Notice, you and Niantic agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration & Mediation (“**NAM**”) in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedure (the “**NAM Rules**”) in effect at the time of arbitration, except as supplemented, where applicable, by the NAM Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings (the “**NAM Mass Filing Rules**”), and as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The NAM Rules are currently available at [https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/).

A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “**Request**”). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.

The arbitration will be conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator. The arbitration hearing (if any) will be held by videoconference, unless either party requests an in-person hearing and the arbitrator agrees. If an in-person hearing is required, it will be held in the county where you live (for US residents), San Francisco, California (for non-US residents), or as determined by the arbitrator (in the case of Batch Arbitration (defined below)). Subject to the NAM Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any NAM fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable NAM Rules.

You and Niantic agree that all materials, documents, information, and communications of any kind relating to the arbitration, as well as all other information pertaining to the existence, progress, or outcome of the arbitration, shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.

You and Niantic agree that at least 14 days before the date set for an arbitration hearing, any party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover any post-offer costs to which they otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer.

### _13.6 Arbitrator_

The single arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the NAM’s roster of arbitrators, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process as defined below is triggered, NAM will appoint the arbitrator for each batch. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the Request, then NAMwill appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the NAM Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process as defined below is triggered, NAM will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.

### _13.7 Authority of Arbitrator_

The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except that all Disputes regarding subsection 13.4 entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” including any claim that all or part of that subsection is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that that such has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 12 “Limitation of Liability” as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

### _13.8 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs_

The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

### _13.9 Batch Arbitration_

To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Niantic agree that in the event that there are ten (10) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Niantic by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a ninety (90) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), NAM shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (or, if between ten (10) and ninety-nine (99) individual Requests are filed, a single batch of all those Requests, and, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests remaining after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“**Batch Arbitration**”).

All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“**Administrative Arbitrator**”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Niantic.

You and Niantic agree to cooperate in good faith with NAM to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision.

### _13.10 Governing Law and Exclusive Venue_

To the limited extent that these Terms allow you or Niantic to initiate litigation in a court instead of arbitration, other than for small claims court actions, both you and Niantic agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California. Each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules.

If you are resident in a member state of the EEA, the United Kingdom, or a jurisdiction in which consumer arbitration is prohibited by local law, the Arbitration Agreement does not apply to you. Because your contract is between you and Niantic International Limited, a company registered to do business under the laws of the United Kingdom, we each agree that the Terms and any disputes between us will be exclusively governed by English law, and exclusively decided in the courts of London, U.K., except to the extent prohibited by law.

If you are an individual consumer, you may be entitled to invoke the mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence, and/or to bring legal proceedings in the courts of that country. If Niantic needs to enforce its rights against you as an individual consumer in the EEA, the United Kingdom, or a jurisdiction in which consumer arbitration is prohibited by local law, we will do so only in your country of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded.

### _13.11 Changes to Dispute Resolution_

if Niantic makes any material changes to this “Arbitration Agreement”, we will notify you. Any such change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us or you prior to the effective date of the change. You should also periodically review these Terms at [https://nianticlabs.com/terms](https://nianticlabs.com/terms). Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Niantic at [termsofservice@nianticlabs.com](mailto:termsofservice@nianticlabs.com), your continued use of the Sites and/or Services, including the acceptance of products and Services offered on the Sites following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement, constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of any previous Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services or of the Sites, any products sold or distributed through the Site, the Services, or these Terms, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) remain in full force and effect. Niantic will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms.

### _13.12 30-Day Right to Opt Out_

You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to [termsofservice@nianticlabs.com](mailto:termsofservice@nianticlabs.com) within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Any opt out notice will be effective only if you send it yourself, on an individual basis, and opt out notices from any third party purporting to act on your behalf will have no effect on your or Niantic’s rights. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your Niantic account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

### _13.13 Invalidity, Expiration_

Except as provided in subsection 13.4 entitled “Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief,” if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Niantic as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.
