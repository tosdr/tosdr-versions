Terms of Service
----------------

### 1\. Acceptance of Terms

The Freecycle Network™ provides online resources, including free gift-item postings, and various email and board posting services, (referred to hereafter as "the Service") subject to the following Terms of Use ("Terms"), which may be updated by The Freecycle Network from time to time. The Freecycle Network will provide notice of materially significant changes to the Term by posting notice on The Freecycle Network site. You can review the most current version of the Terms at [Terms of Service](https://freecycle.org/pages/tos). By using the Service in any way, you are agreeing to comply with these Terms. In addition, when using particular Freecycle Network services, you agree to abide by any applicable posted guidelines for all Freecycle Network services, which may change from time to time. Should you object to any term or condition of these Terms, any guidelines, or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with The Freecycle Network in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of The Freecycle Network.

### 2\. Content

You understand that all postings, messages, text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, or other materials ("Content") posted on, transmitted through, or linked from the Service are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you are entirely responsible for all Content that you post, email or otherwise make available via the Service. You understand that The Freecycle Network does not control, and is not responsible for Content made available through the Service, and that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. Furthermore, The Freecycle Network site and Content available through the Service may contain links to other websites, which are completely independent of The Freecycle Network. The Freecycle Network makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained in any such site. Your linking to any other websites is at your own risk. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, that you may not rely on said Content, and that under no circumstances will The Freecycle Network be liable in any way for any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge that not all Content is pre-screened or approved by The Freecycle Network, but that The Freecycle Network shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse, delete or move any Content that is available via the Service, for violating the letter or spirit of the Terms or for any other reason. Should you be a moderator of a local group, you agree to abide by all Terms as well as the rules noted in bold on Freecycle.org within the FAQ section. Should you not do so, you will be asked to step down and remove yourself from the role of moderator and/or owner of the local Freecycle group. The local members are Freecycle members to which you volunteer to provide moderating services as a steward.
