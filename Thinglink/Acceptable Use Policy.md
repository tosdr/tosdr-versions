ThingLink’s Acceptable Use Policy (the "AUP") sets out the acceptable and non-acceptable uses of our ThingLink service.

This AUP is structured as follows. Section I contains general rules applicable to all users. Section II contains rules applicable to users of the specific types of ThingLink service accounts. Finally, Section III contains rules for the use of third-party content from ThingLink partners.

##### Rules specific to third party content

Getty Images. The following restrictions apply to the use of content for which Getty Images International, its group companies, or its other licensors are the rightholders (referred to as "Getty Content");

* You may only use Getty Content in a non-commercial manner, and may not sell, modify, re-use, re-sell, distribute, display, reproduce, or make any other use of Getty Content without a prior written authorization from us.
* You may not take any action that would enable the file-sharing of Getty Content
* You may not use Getty Content in logos, trademarks, services marks, or any other branding or identifiers
* You may not take any measures to circumvent any features that disable your operating system’s standard right-click feature on Getty Content
* You may not download any Getty Content on a stand-alone basis

We reserve the right to remove any Getty Content from our service without notice if we, in our sole discretion, believe that the use of Getty Content breaches i) these rules, ii) the Terms of Use, or ii) otherwise infringes on third party rights.

We reserve all rights to take appropriate action in case of a breach of these rules, including, but not limited to, removing the offending content, or either suspending or terminating the account of the person in breach. We need to do that because we want to make sure that all of our users can enjoy the service, and not get harmed by the actions of the few who might not have others best interests at heart.
