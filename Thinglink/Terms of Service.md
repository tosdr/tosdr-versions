Last updated 27 May 2020

Welcome to www.ThingLink.com, the website and online service of ThingLink (as defined in Section 14 below). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, web site, APIs, and software, including any manuals, instructions or other documents or materials that we make available to you and which describe the functionality, components, features or requirements of the service, including any aspect of the installation, configuration, integration, operation, use, support or maintenance thereof provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”).

BY ACCEPTING THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”), EITHER BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, CLICKING A BOX INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR EXECUTING AN ORDERING DOCUMENT OR ONLINE ORDER SPECIFYING THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED HEREUNDER, INCLUDING ANY ADDENDA AND SUPPLEMENTS THERETO THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT (AN “ORDER”), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND TO THE COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION AS SET FORTH IN THE THINGLINK [PRIVACY POLICY](https://thinglink.com/privacy), WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE A REGISTERED USER OF THE SERVICE. It is effective between you and us as of the date you accept this Agreement or first access the Service, whichever is earlier (“Effective Date”). ThingLink reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (each a “User” and collectively, “Users”). IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE THE TERM “YOU” SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES. ADDITIONALLY, IF YOU ARE USING THIS SERVICE AS AN EDUCATOR, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE ACTING ON BEHALF OF (OR HAVE PERMISSION FROM) THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND TO USE THE SERVICE AS A PART OF YOUR CURRICULUM AND THAT, WITH RESPECT ANY STUDENT YOU AUTHORIZE TO USE THE SERVICE PURSUANT TO YOUR AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE OBTAINED APPROPRIATE PARENTAL CONSENT FOR SUCH STUDENT’S USE OF THE SERVICE, AS APPLICABLE.

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

### Use of Service

1. Eligibility.
    
    You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with ThingLink, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations, (including without limitation all applicable laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside, privacy, and data protection). In order to register for an account, we may, at our discretion, allow you to sign up through a third-party service provider, such as Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, or Google. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ([COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions&sa=D&ust=1527246641521000)) prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent (“Consent”). Accordingly, students accessing the Service subject to Consent provided via their education institution, as allowed under COPPA, will require the use of a unique invitation code supplied by their education institution in order to create an account. Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 without Consent, is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by ThingLink.
    
2. ThingLink Service.
    
    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and your payment of any applicable fees, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service as permitted by the features of the Service during the term of this Agreement. You shall employ all physical, administrative and technical controls, screening and security procedures and other safeguards necessary to: (a) securely administer the distribution and use of all access credentials and protect against any unauthorized access to or use of the Service; and (b) control the content and use of User Content (as defined below), including the uploading or other provision of User Content for processing by the Service. ThingLink reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and ThingLink Content (as defined below). ThingLink may terminate this license in accordance with this Agreement. We may from time to time in our sole discretion engage third parties to provide, maintain, and/or improve the Service (each, a “Subcontractor”).
    
3. Accounts.
    
    Your ThingLink account gives you access to the Service and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users, and these different accounts may have different functionalities available to them. If you open an account on behalf of your student, child or ward (or give your Consent for such account to be created), then (i) “you” includes both you and your student, child or ward; and (ii) you represent and warrant that you are legally authorized to grant any and all rights granted under this Agreement. By connecting to ThingLink with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service as further described in our Privacy Policy.
    
    Unless you are an educator, parent or guardian managing your student, child or ward’s account, you may never use another User’s account. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify ThingLink immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. ThingLink will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.
    
    You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your settings page. By providing ThingLink your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

### User Content License Grant.

By posting or otherwise making available any User Content on or through the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to us a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and any name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and ThingLink’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.

### Mobile Software

1. Mobile Software.
    
    We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device (“Mobile Software”). To use the Mobile Software you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Software. ThingLink does not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile Software and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges. ThingLink hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Software for one ThingLink account on any mobile device controlled, owned or leased solely by you.
    
    You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Software, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Software to any third party or use the Mobile Software to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Mobile Software, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile Software, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Software; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile Software. You acknowledge that ThingLink may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and ThingLink or its third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof).
    
    Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. ThingLink reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement. If the Mobile Software is being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision applies. The Mobile Software will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the Service and any accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms of Service and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms of Service. The Mobile Software originates in the United States, and is subject to United States export laws and regulations. The Mobile Software may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the Mobile Software may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile Software and ThingLink Service.
    
2. Mobile Application Marketplaces.
    
    The following applies to any Mobile Software you acquire from the iTunes Store, the Google Play, or any other similar marketplace for mobile applications (“Sourced Mobile Software”): You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is solely between you and ThingLink, not the proprietor of such marketplace (each a “Proprietor”), and that Proprietor has no responsibility for the Sourced Mobile Software or content thereof. Your use of the Sourced Mobile Software must comply with the applicable terms of service for the marketplace from which you downloaded the Sourced Mobile Software. You acknowledge that Proprietor has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Sourced Mobile Software. In the event of any failure of the Sourced Mobile Software to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Proprietor, and Proprietor will refund the purchase price for the Sourced Mobile Software to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Proprietor will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Sourced Mobile Software, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by this Agreement and any law applicable to ThingLink as a provider of the software. You acknowledge that Proprietor is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the Sourced Mobile Software or your possession and/or use of the Sourced Mobile Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Sourced Mobile Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and all such claims are governed solely by this Agreement and any law applicable to ThingLink as a provider of the software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Sourced Mobile Software or your possession and use of that Sourced Mobile Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, ThingLink, not Proprietor, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement. You and ThingLink acknowledge and agree that Proprietor, and Proprietor’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your license of the Sourced Mobile Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Proprietor will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as relates to your license of the Sourced Mobile Software against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

    The governing law is:

    * Manner of Giving Notices to ThingLink. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all notices to ThingLink related to this Agreement will be in writing and will be effective upon (a) personal delivery, (b) the second business day after mailing, (c) confirmed delivery by courier service, or (d), except for notices of termination or an indemnifiable claim, the day of sending by email.
    * Agreement to Governing Law and Jurisdiction. Each party agrees to the applicable governing law above without regard to choice or conflicts of law rules, and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the applicable courts above.
    * Legal Fees and Costs. The prevailing party in any action arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, including, without limitation, arbitration fees and fees of experts.
    * Arbitration for Users Domiciled in The United States. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THINGLINK. If you are domiciled in a country for which arbitration is designated in Section 13(a) above as the exclusive forum for dispute resolution, then you agree to first contact us at [info@ThingLink.com](mailto:info@ThingLink.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute you have with us after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/). The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and ThingLink agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights by arbitration.
    * Class Action / Jury Trial Waiver. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND THINGLINK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
12. General
    * Assignment. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by ThingLink without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.
    * Entire Agreement / Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with ThingLink in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and ThingLink concerning the Service. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence shall be (1) the applicable Order Form, (2) any additional terms or addenda applicable to specific versions of the Service, and (3) this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
    * No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and ThingLink’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
