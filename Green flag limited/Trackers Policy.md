### SO, WHAT ARE COOKIES?

While they are nowhere near as delicious as their crumbly real-world counterparts, website cookies are handy little things.  
  
Cookies and similar technologies let us learn more about what people are doing when they use our site, and they help us remember when you've visit our site more than once. This all makes it easier for us to get you the information you need as quickly as possible. Importantly, cookies also help us keep our website safe and secure.  
  
Don't worry, cookies can never be used to identify you. If we ever want to collect information that could personally identify you, we're totally up-front about it and make sure we get your permission first.  
  
You can find out more about our different cookies below, and choose which ones you're OK with. Please note, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of our site.
