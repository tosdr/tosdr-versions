The Genius Link Services include the information, software, products, and services contained in or available through our public website, geniuslink.com, our Dashboard, https://my.geniuslink.com, our blog, geniuslink.com/blog/, our APIs, api.geni.us, and our knowledge base, intercom.geni.us (together, our "Site"). These Terms of Service govern your use of the Genius Link Services, including when You use our tools to build or edit links, enter information into our Site such as your affiliate or reporting tokens, post or maintain specialized links, create or review reports from our Site, or browse or click on links on web pages.

Use of the Genius Link Services constitutes your agreement to all the terms, conditions, and notices contained in these Terms of Service and our [Privacy Policy](https://geniuslink.com/privacy).

To agree to these Terms of Service, check the "I agree" box when creating an account for the Genius Link Services. If You do not agree to these terms, or if You are not at least 18 years old, do not check "I agree," and do not use the Genius Link Services or the Site. GeoRiot reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service. See "Modification of these Terms of Service" below.

Genius Link Services
--------------------

The Genius Link Services are a link management service that You can use any time You place a link in Your Digital Property. "Your Digital Property" includes your website, mobile application or other online property, and it includes offline properties such as when You print a link or place QR codes. The Genius Link Services provide a specialized link(s), called a "Geni.us Link" (even when using a domain other than “geni.us”) to replace any link in Your Digital Property that You specify. Once You use a Geni.us Link in place of your original link, the Geni.us Link may route users who click on it ("Buyers") to the intended, or most relevant, item (“Product”) in a retail website (“Storefront”) that is most appropriate based on the Buyer's location, device, language or other factors. (Note: we refer to our links as "Geni.us Link" even though they may use a different domain.)

The Genius Link Services process certain information (“Buyer Information”) when a Buyer clicks a Geni.us Link in the course of viewing and interacting with content on Your Digital Property (a “Transaction”).

Buyer Information also includes any of the following:

* Information identifying and describing (“Device Data”) the personal computer, laptop, smartphone or other device providing Internet access through a browser used for the Transaction ("Device"), including the operating system and browser used by the Device for the Transaction ("User Agent Information").
    
* Information identifying the language used by the Device for the Transaction (“Language Information”). The Internet Protocol ("IP") address of the Device used for the Transaction, which allows identification of the logical and to some extent geographical location of the Device used in the Transaction ("Location Data").
    
* The URL of Your Digital Property on which the originating Geni.us Link is sited ("Client URL").
    
* Product identification information for Products via the Geni.us Link the Device was used to click.
    
* The Geni.us Link may also incorporate the appropriate affiliate information for your link if You have provided GeoRiot with the applicable affiliate parameters.
    

In addition, You may elect to collect and provide GeoRiot with the following information:

* Limited purchase information obtained by the Storefront in the event a Buyer purchases a Product in the course of a Transaction, such as the number of products purchased, a list of items (or categories of items), purchase prices, and timestamp of the Transaction.
    

The Geni.us Link may support the following uses of information for your benefit:

* _Dynamic Links._ You can use a single link to route Buyers to the appropriate Storefront based on information such as the user's location, device, and language set in the browser. This may include dynamic links on Your Digital Property which automatically populate a Storefront customized for the Buyer on Your Digital Property. For example, a client's website that reviews technology devices may display related products with links to purchase them on Amazon's Storefront. The Geni.us Link may be used to ensure the Amazon link that appears on the client's website is directed appropriately based on the Buyer's location.
    
* _Automatic Product Localization._ You can use a single link to automatically route Buyers to the appropriate Product in the Buyer's local Storefront, such as the Amazon or Apple Music online stores. Automatic affiliation may be used to earn commissions from the correct local retailer's Storefront. For example, a Buyer in Germany may be sent to the Amazon Germany Storefront by a Geni.us Link from a client website, and the client might earn a commission through the Amazon Germany affiliate program.
    
* _Choice Pages._ You may use a link to provide a mobile-optimized landing page where a Buyer can view different buying options, rather than having an automated process pick for them.
    
* _Retargeting._ You may use a Geni.us Link to fire javascript and set pixels on your behalf to enable collection of your activity data by third parties such as Facebook and Google.
    

* _Data Analytics._ The Data Analytics service provides You with marketing content based on Location Data, Device Data, User Agent Information, Language Information and Transactions data. The Data Analytics service helps You ensure that marketing efforts are relevant to the Buyer and appropriate to the country or region where the Buyer is located.
    

When You create a Genius Link account, You must provide GeoRiot with contact information for an individual user authorized to use the Genius Link Services and communicate with GeoRiot (“Your User”), either as a sole proprietor or authorized representative of a non-living business entity. At a minimum, the contact information will include Your User's name and email address. We may also collect the content of Your User's communications with us, transactional information, and usage data when Your User engages with the Genius Link Services (collectively, “Your User's Information”) or any other additional information about your business that you provide.

Fees and Payment
----------------

The Genius Link Services employ a monthly fee model with additional pay-per-click pricing for overages; You will be charged on a monthly basis. In your plan, You may be given an amount of free clicks that You can use within the calendar month timeframe. After that number of clicks, if any, is exhausted, additional "buckets" of clicks will be automatically added to your monthly invoice. You will only be charged for the clicks on your Geni.us Links during the previous month that are deemed by GeoRiot to have originated organically (non-bot, or non-junk, clicks). Other additional features (such as a custom domains or users) are provided for an additional monthly fee. You agree to pay the plan price, any additional per-click fees, and any other charges incurred in connection with your Genius Link subscription/account (“Your Account”) (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect for the plan selected. The rates in effect are found on our website at [http://geniuslink.com/pricing](http://geniuslink.com/pricing). You may also find your rate, if different than the published rates, and current account balance on the Billing page in the Dashboard ([https://my.geniuslink.com/account/billing](https://my.geniuslink.com/account/billing)). We will notify You by email at least 14 days in advance of any mandatory rate change affecting Your Account and You are permitted to change to any currently available plans at any time. When changing plans, your monthly fee will reflect the change as of the day the plan was changed, and your fees will be pro-rated. Downgrading plans may result in an irreversible loss of features of your existing Geni.us Links.

Payments can be made via credit card or debit card through our Dashboard. Unless You make other arrangements with us, we will invoice You on the first day of each month and automatically charge your payment card shortly thereafter. In the event that the payment card could not be charged initially, we will make subsequent attempts. If You cannot provide a valid payment card, contact GeoRiot, and at GeoRiot's discretion, monthly invoicing via ACH, SWIFT, or other electronic means may be made available within 14 days of creating Your Account. If no means of electronic transfer is available, GeoRiot, at its option, may create a custom agreement and payment model with You.

A free trial may be provided for new clients and may consist of a period of time, as defined on the pricing page, billing page or in a separate agreement, in which the client may have an unlimited number of free clicks and access to features. Where a free trial is offered, each plan gets a certain number of clicks included each month before being charged overages after the trial is over. The number of free clicks, if any, before your payment card will be charged is published at [http://geniuslink.com/pricing](http://geniuslink.com/pricing) and is dependent on the plan You choose. The number of free clicks depends on the free trial offered and the plan You select and is subject to change.

You agree to pay any invoice issued by GeoRiot within 30 days of the date of invoice unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by GeoRiot. GeoRiot reserves all remedies if You fail to make timely payment, including termination of Your Account. In any case, in the event of late or non-payment, the Genius Link Services may immediately limit functionality of your Geni.us Links. This may include disabling your monetization information (if any were supplied), using the Genius Link Services monetization information for any subsequent clicks on Geni.us Links, disabling advanced targets, disabling support for your specified pixels during a Geni.us Link redirect, and significantly reducing functionality of your Dashboard. This may also include converting your Geni.us Links into Choice Pages which may include additional retailers and/or relevant product ads and/or cookies or analogous technologies. You are not eligible to receive any compensation for revenue loss or any potential revenue earned from your links while payment on your account is late or you are otherwise in violation of these Terms of Service, in which case your account is not "Current".

If Your Account is past due for more than 45 days, or closed, we may reassign your Geni.us Link. We may also reassign your Geni.us Link (1) with your consent, (2) if your Geni.us Link has failed to yield at least 30 organic clicks (i.e., non-junk clicks) per month for three consecutive months, or (3) we have marked Your Account as a Terms of Service violator.

Generally, all fees and charges are non-refundable. At our discretion, we may issue refunds or credits. If we do issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. We may change the fees and charges currently in effect, or add new fees or charges, by giving You notice in advance and an opportunity to cancel. If You want to use a different payment card or You need to update your payment card details, You may do so within the Dashboard by adding a new card first, which will delete your previous card. If You believe someone has accessed the Genius Link Services using your username and password without your authorization, please immediately notify us at hi@geni.us with the subject "Suspected unauthorized access". You are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access the Genius Link Services through an Internet access provider or other third party service.

Any accrued account credits will be applied first to an invoice. If the account credit doesn't fully cover the amount then You are responsible for covering the difference via the payment method on file. If your account credit fully covers the current invoice, the remaining balance will be applied to the next invoice.

Excess account credit may be paid out via a check after accruing at least $1,000 USD or at the discretion of GeoRiot. Accrued account credits are forfeited if Your Account is terminated.

Term; Termination and Renewal
-----------------------------

Subject to amendment as provided below, these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect while You use the Genius Link Services. You may terminate Your Account at any time. Your subscription will renew automatically until it is terminated. You may terminate your subscription using the Dashboard at [https://my.geniuslink.com/account/#close-account-section](#close-account-section) or by contacting Customer Service at hi@geni.us. We may terminate Your Account at any time upon notice to You, however, if we deem Your Account to be violating our Terms of Service we may terminate your subscription/account without notice to You.

If You disagree with the amount of any invoice, You agree to inform us of the grounds for the dispute within seven days after You received the invoice.

Most client concerns can be resolved quickly and to the client's satisfaction by emailing the Genius Link team at help@geni.us or calling us and leaving a message at (206) 395-5721 during normal business hours in the UTC-8 (West Coast) time zone.

Effect of Termination
---------------------

No charges will be made to your payment card for any clicks served after termination, but any Geni.us Link may, or may not, at our discretion, only resolve to the original destination, and additional features such as advanced targets or remarketing pixels may be disabled.

Upon termination of Your Account, your right to use the Genius Link Services and our right to charge You will terminate, but obligations that arose before termination that by their nature should continue, will continue (e.g., confidentiality covenant, indemnification obligations, payment obligations, disclaimers, liability limitations) and You will be responsible for paying any charges that accrued before termination.

Failure to Provide Monetization Information
-------------------------------------------

When You sign up for the Genius Link Services You are encouraged, but not required, to provide your monetization information for the relevant affiliate programs (e.g., an affiliate token or an example link from the program), or other monetization methods, via the specialized "Affiliate" tool in the Dashboard (found at [https://my.geniuslink.com/Affiliate](https://my.geniuslink.com/Affiliate)). Until You have provided us with the means to associate your Geni.us Links with the appropriate program to monetize clicks or sales, You will not receive any commissions, payments, credit, or other benefits from these monetization programs or from clicks on your links. **The same goes for countries or monetization programs that You do not support. In such cases GeoRiot may apply their monetization information to your links. You are not eligible to receive any compensation for any perceived or real revenue loss until you add your own monetization information, at which point the Genius Link Services will use the information that you have provided. Further, during the development of new monetization features You will not be eligible to earn revenue directly or indirectly until after the completion of the feature.** Please take note that affiliate parameters, or other monetization information, already embedded in your links that are converted to Geni.us Links may not automatically transfer during the Geni.us Link redirection, regardless of the affiliate program or link. You must supply your monetization information via the "Affiliate" tool in the Dashboard to ensure that You receive the appropriate compensation for clicks on your Geni.us Links. Contact the Genius Link team if You have questions about the monetization of a link not specifically supported by the Genius Link Services.

Up Time
-------

We strive to meet industry uptime standards, and as of the published date, has had over 99.99% uptime, but we cannot guarantee that the Genius Link Services, the Site, or the Dashboard will be accessible and available at all times. For example, sometimes the Dashboard may be inaccessible due to service maintenance, user error, or failures of our upstream providers beyond our control. If having a specific uptime guarantee is important to your business, please contact us to enter into a separate agreement.

Our goal is 100% uptime; however, from time to time, we may need to suspend service for system upgrades and maintenance. Except in unusual cases, we will give 24 hours public advance notice of any planned system downtime. As the Genius Link Services run independently from the Dashboard, we will not generally give notice of Dashboard downtime.

We will not be liable for lost clicks due to Site access or the Genius Link Services being interrupted. We will work to restore services as quickly as we can, but we make no guarantees as to how quickly we will be able to restore service since it depends on many factors. Further, we may require action from You to restore service and You are requested to comply as quickly as possible. We may, but are not required, to compensate You for any downtime in Site access or the Genius Link Services in our sole discretion by giving You performance credits.

Similarly GeoRiot is not liable and cannot be held accountable for issues or errors in regards to the affiliate networks' or advertisers' handling of clicks or Geni.us Links.

Service Data
------------

We collect, use, and maintain data in connection with the Genius Link Services in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](http://geniuslink.com/privacy), the terms of which are incorporated into these Terms of Service and are part of your agreement with us. You acknowledge and agree that we will collect data from your Geni.us Links and clicks with that of other customers for use in our analytical services. Some analytical services are a premium service that You may select in your service options. Aggregated click data are our work product and property which may be sold or shared at our discretion and without any compensation to you. In our sole discretion, we may choose to make metrics available to our clients in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.

You are also permitted to override the "hover text" or the browser's status bar text of the Geni.us Link that replaces your link. When modifying either the status bar or hover property, the text shown must be the approximate final destination of the URL being modified or relevant information about the URL's final destination.

Excusable Delay
---------------

Neither You nor we will be deemed to be in default of, or to have breached, any provision of these Terms of Service as a result of any delay, failure in performance or interruption of service, resulting directly or indirectly from acts of nature, such as fires, earthquakes and other catastrophes, acts of civil or military authorities, downed nodes (outside of their control), civil disturbance, work stoppages, terrorism, wars, alien or zombie invasions, and other unforeseeable events that are not the direct or indirect fault of either party (collectively, "Force Majeure Events"). In any such case, the affected party will use commercially reasonable efforts to work around the Force Majeure Event and mitigate any impacts of any delay or failure in performance or interruption of service. The delay or failure in performance or interruption of service must be without the fault or negligence of the party claiming excusable delay, and the party claiming excusable delay must promptly notify the other party of the delay. For avoidance of doubt, a Force Majeure Event does not relieve a party of a payment obligation that accrued before the Force Majeure Event.

Below You will find a Binding Arbitration section, which deals with the availability of damages. If there is any conflict between the above "Disclaimers and Warranty" section and the “Binding Arbitration” section below, the terms of the Binding Arbitration section will govern.

For jurisdictions that restrict our ability to limit our liability: Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms of Service, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the greatest extent allowed by law.

If You are a California resident, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, which says:

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

**Explanation:** Under section 1542, a general release, like the one You are agreeing to here, does not apply to cases in which:

(1) a person does not know at the time of signing the release that he or she currently has a favorable claim they could make, and

(2) had he or she known it at the time, they might not have agreed to sign the release.

YOU ARE AGREEING THAT THIS SECTION, EVEN IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU. If You are a resident of some other state or jurisdiction, You waive any similar or comparable statute or doctrine that might be in effect there.

Language
--------

All communications and notices to be made or given pursuant to these Terms of Service will be in the English language. In the event these Terms of Service are translated, the original English version will prevail.

Governing Law
-------------

These Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the State of Washington in the United States of America, without giving effect to any conflict of law rules. You agree that venue for any dispute proceeding (litigation or arbitration) will be in King County, Washington, and hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts there.

Binding Arbitration; Waiver of Class Action
-------------------------------------------

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

Most client concerns can be resolved quickly and to the client's satisfaction by emailing us at hi@geni.us.

If You and we have not been able to resolve a dispute after attempting to do so informally, including through mediation (which GeoRiot will pay for), each party agrees to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of courts of general jurisdiction.

Arbitration Procedures
----------------------

You and we (each, a “party;” together, the “parties”) agree that all disputes and claims between us will be settled by arbitration or in small claims court. This agreement to arbitrate (the "Arbitration Agreement") is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to the following:

* Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
    
* Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
    
* Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which You are not a member of a certified class; and
    
* Claims that may arise after the termination of the Terms of Service.
    

Although You may not bring a suit in a court other than small claims court, You may bring issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission or the Attorney General of your state. If the law allows, such agencies can seek relief against us on your behalf.

By entering into this Arbitration Agreement, You and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

Because this document includes this Arbitration Agreement, making it a transaction in interstate commerce, it is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

This Arbitration Agreement will survive termination of Your Account.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to us should be addressed to General Counsel C/O Geniuslink, P.O. Box 47406, Seattle, WA 98146 (the "Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If You and we are not able to reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 calendar days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding by filing an arbitration Demand. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either party will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount You or we should receive.

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), known collectively as "the AAA Rules." These rules may be as modified by this Arbitration Agreement; and they will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available at three sources: (1) online at adr.org; (2) by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879; or (3) by writing to the Notice Address.

The arbitrator will decide all issues, including the scope and enforceability of the Terms of Service, and arbitrability under the Arbitration Agreement.

Unless we and You agree otherwise, arbitration hearings will make use of telephonic conferencing to the extent practical. Otherwise, hearings will take place in a location reasonably convenient for both parties, and with due consideration for the parties ability to travel and other similarly pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA.

If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that You may choose from the following three ways of conducting the arbitration: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

The payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

This arbitrator may make rulings or resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses. This may be done at any time during the proceeding; it also may be done upon request by either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

Either party may apply to the arbitrator seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also, without waiving any remedy under this Arbitration Agreement, may seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitration tribunal.

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of a single party and only to provide that party's relief. You and we agree that each may bring claims against the other only as individuals; neither can become a plaintiff or class member in a class or representative proceeding. Unless both You and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of multiple persons. The arbitrator is not allowed to preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Any attempt to issue a class or representative award will exceed the arbitrator's power.

Changes to the Arbitration Provision. We may, in the future, make changes to this Arbitration Agreement by providing You notice under the "Modification of these Terms of Service" provision above. We agree that should such a change be made while You are our customer, You may reject it by sending us written notice. The notice must be given within 30 calendar days of the notice of modification to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, You are agreeing, in accordance with the language of this provision, that You will settle any dispute between us by arbitration. This remains in effect even if it seems to conflict with some other provision in these Terms of Service. Note: This paragraph does not apply if the change concerns only the Notice Address.

General
-------

You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between You and us as a result of the Terms of Service or use of the Genius Link Services. Our performance under these Terms of Service is subject to existing laws and legal process. Nothing contained in these Terms of Service diminishes GeoRiot's right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating either to your use of our service or to information supplied to us. If any part of these Terms of Service is determined to be invalid or unenforceable as a result of the above warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, or as a result of any other legal requirements, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be considered to have been replaced by whatever valid, enforceable provision most closely matches what the original provision was intending to accomplish. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue in effect. We waive no right under the Terms of Service even if we fail to enforce or exercise it.

These Terms of Service, including the Data Processing Addendum, the Privacy Policy, and the service options on our Site constitute the entire agreement between You and GeoRiot with respect to the Genius Link Services. It supersedes all prior or contemporary communications and proposals between us, whether electronic, oral, or written. You may not pass on to someone else any of your rights or obligations under these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy without our written consent. We may transfer our rights under the Terms of Service to someone else without your consent.

Unless otherwise stated, we may communicate with You officially by any reasonable means now known or later developed. These currently include email, regular mail, and postings on our Dashboard.

A version of these Terms of Service or of any notice sent in electronic form will be equally as admissible in legal proceedings relating to these Terms of Service as documents generated and maintained in paper form. All parties approve of these Terms of Service and all related documents having been written in English.

-------------------------------------------------------------

This Data Processing Addendum (this "Addendum") is part of the Genius Link Terms of Service ("Agreement") between GeoRiot Networks, Inc. ("GeoRiot") and You, a GeoRiot client (each a “party;” together the “parties”). This Addendum governs GeoRiot's Processing of Personal Information that relates to natural persons in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the UK, or Switzerland in connection with GeoRiot's provision of the Genius Link Services described in the Agreement. Except as expressly stated otherwise, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the Agreement and the terms of this Addendum, the terms of this Addendum will take precedence. The Addendum will be effective as of the most recent date You accept it by clicking on the "I agree" box when accepting the Agreement (the “Effective Date”).

Unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms used but not defined in this Addendum have the meanings given to them in the GDPR or in the Agreement.

1. **Role of the Parties**. You acknowledge and agree that (i) with respect to Buyers' Personal Information, You and GeoRiot are both Controllers, as described in Section 4 of the Privacy Policy, incorporated here by reference; and (ii) with respect to your and Your User's Personal Information, GeoRiot is the sole Controller, as described in Section 4 of the Privacy Policy, incorporated here by reference.
    
2. **Options Regarding Collection of Personal Information**. GeoRiot offers You the option of suppressing re-targeting pixels where a Geni.us Link is accessed by an individual in the EU. By accepting the Agreement, and therefore this Addendum, You acknowledge that your choice to utilize re-targeting pixels may result in either consent of the customer or notice to the customer being required under Applicable Law.
    
3. **Consent**. Where Consent is required in order for either GeoRiot or You to lawfully process Personal Information in order to provide the Genius Link Services, You will be responsible for obtaining Consent from your customers who will interact with the Genius Link Services. If further consents are required under Applicable Law, then You are responsible for obtaining follow-up consent.
    
4. **Notice**. Where European Data Protection Law, including the GDPR or the UK Data Protection Laws, requires either You or GeoRiot to give notice of Processing activities, You will be responsible for providing notice that contains all disclosures required by law to your customers who will interact with the Genius Link Services.
    
5. **Confidentiality.** You are each responsible for determining the best manner for your organization to restrict access to Personal Information to those authorized persons who need such information to provide the Genius Link Services and to ensure such authorized persons are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any Personal Information. GeoRiot has the same responsibility for its organization.
    
6. **Security.** You are responsible for determining the best manner for your organization to implement, using all measures required in accordance with good industry practice, technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the Personal Information provided by You and Processed by GeoRiot. GeoRiot has the same responsibility for its organization. Such security measures must be at least as protective as the security measures required under the Agreement and Applicable Law.
    
7. **Processors.** Either party's organization may engage Processors to assist in providing the Genius Link Services consistent with the Agreement. Each party will be responsible for ensuring that any Processing undertaken by any Processor on its behalf is conducted in a manner that meets the requirements of European Data Protection Law and the UK Data Protection Laws.
    
8. **Access Requests.** Each party's organization is responsible for maintaining, with regard to the data in its possession, appropriate technical and organizational measures needed to respond to requests from Data Subjects to access, correct, transmit, limit Processing of, or delete any relevant Personal Information. If You receive a request that may implicate Personal Information held by GeoRiot, You agree to promptly forward such request.
    
9. **Recordkeeping.** Upon a request issued by a Supervisory Authority for records regarding Personal Information, each party's organization will be responsible for the provision of information in its respective possession. In the event that a request is made solely to GeoRiot, You agree to provide to GeoRiot records related to consent and notice as described in Parts 2 and 3 of this Addendum to be shared with the Supervisory Authority.
    
10. **Cooperation.** Each party's organization agrees to cooperate to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with each party's requests related to data protection impact assessments and consultation with Supervisory Authorities and for the fulfillment of obligations to respond to requests for exercising a Data Subject's rights provided under European Data Protection Law, including the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Laws.
    
11. **Transfer of Personal Information; Appointment.** With regard to Personal Information provided directly to GeoRiot from You, You authorize GeoRiot to transfer, store or Process Personal Information in the United States or any other country in which GeoRiot or its Processors maintain facilities. You appoint GeoRiot to perform any such transfer of Personal Information to any such country and to store and Process Personal Information in order to provide the Services. GeoRiot will conduct all such activity in compliance with the Agreement, including this Addendum, applicable law and your instructions.
    
12. **Transfer of Personal Information from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland**.The Standard Contractual Clauses for Controllers as approved by the European Commission pursuant to Decision C(2021)3701 (the "SCCs") will apply to Personal Information transferred from the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland to a jurisdiction that is not recognized by the European Commission or the Swiss Federal Data Protection Authority as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. For purposes of the SCCs, GeoRiot is "data importer" and You are "data exporter." The SCCs are hereby incorporated into this Addendum as Attachment 1 below, and the organizations of each party agree to accept their respective obligations under the SCCs. Nothing in this paragraph should be construed to prevent either party's organization from using a different data transfer mechanism permitted or required by the jurisdiction from which the Personal Information is exported.
    
13. **Retention.** GeoRiot will retain Personal Information received from You only as long as may be reasonably required in connection with GeoRiot's performance of the Agreement or as otherwise required under applicable law.
    
14. **Deletion or Return.** If You choose, after the end of the provision of the Genius Link Services related to Processing, GeoRiot will delete or return to You all Personal Information we have collected regarding your customers and delete existing copies unless continued storage is required to comply with any applicable law.
    
15. **Breach Notification.** After becoming aware of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, GeoRiot will notify You without undue delay, but no later than 24 hours, of: (a) the nature of the breach; (b) the number and categories of Data Subjects and records affected; and (c) the name and contact details for the relevant contact person at GeoRiot.

17. **Indemnification.** You agree to indemnify GeoRiot for all costs, including legal costs, penalties, and civil liabilities, incurred by GeoRiot stemming from your failure to secure consent for the Processing of Personal Information by either your organization or GeoRiot through your use of the Genius Link Services.
