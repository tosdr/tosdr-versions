Geniuslink Spam Policy
======================

Geniuslink does not tolerate the use of our services to spam. We strive to provide a trusted, high quality link sharing experience for our clients and their end-users, and we believe that they should not be redirected to spam, blocked, blacklisted, or malware URLs.

**What is spam?**

In the context of electronic messaging, spam refers to unsolicited, bulk or indiscriminate messages, typically sent for a commercial purpose. Typically, spam mail contains advertisements or marketing for fraudulent, mischievious or less than honorable schemes.

**What is not allowed?**

While Geniuslink is a service primarily for monitoring and optimizing your marketing and affiliate links, it is not a platform for spamming individuals with your links. We keep a record of URLs served via the Geniuslink service and continuously work to prevent spam links getting built or distributed. While it's not possible for us to catch every instance of spam, we attempt to eliminate all spam links detected or reported to us. Please note:

* You are not allowed to build links to destinations associated with blocked / blacklisted domains or IPs.
* You are not allowed to use tracking links or pixels inside unwanted communications.

If you are not sure about your links or if you think Geniuslink wrongly placed your links in the spam category, feel free to contact our support team and we'll be happy to assist you.

**What if my links are spam?**

If we find that you are spamming, action will be immediately taken against your account. Like most users of the internet, we hate spammers and we won't tolerate them in our community. Below are some of the possible actions we retain the right to take against spammers:

* We will redirect all links associated with the spamming account to Google.com
* We will terminate the account without prior notice
* We will not issue any refunds to your account
* Your information may be sent to the proper law enforcement entities.

We have a very efficient team and tools that allow us to quickly and easily investigate potential spam links. Before taking any action against your account or tracking links, we will make sure to get as much information as possible regarding the URLs to confirm/assess whether or not the links are spam. Once we reach a decision about spam links or accounts, that decision will be final and irrevocable.

**I encountered a spam link built with Geniuslink, what should I do?**

If you find anyone using our service for any kind of spam activities or if you ever encounter a tracking link that redirects to a spam site, please contact us immediately to report it at abuse@geni.us. The moment we can confirm a reported links is spam we will work to remove them as fast as possible. When reporting spam, please make sure that you include information about the URL and why you think it's spam. We take all spam reports very seriously.
