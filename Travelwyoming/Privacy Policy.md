The State of Wyoming and its agencies make no express or implied warranties as to this map and the data it displays. Users of this information should review or consult the primary data and information sources to ascertain the reliability or usability of the information. The State of Wyoming and its agencies assume no liability associated with the use or misuse of this information and specifically retain sovereign immunity and all defenses available to them by law.

**Ordering Publications** 

The State of Wyoming does not collect information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for such information.

Thus you give up the claim that any use of such material violates any of your rights including moral rights, privacy rights, proprietary or other property rights, publicity rights, rights to credit for material or ideas, or any other right, including the right to approve the way the Wyoming Office of Tourism uses such material. 

Any material submitted to this Site may be adapted, broadcast, changed, copied, disclosed, licensed, performed, posted, published, sold and transmitted by the Wyoming Office of Tourism anywhere in the world, in any medium, forever. 

The Wyoming Office of Tourism is free to use, without compensation to you, any concepts, ideas, know-how or techniques contained in any communication you send to the Site for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to developing, manufacturing and marketing products using such information. 

However, you agree and understand that the Wyoming Office of Tourism is not obligated to use any such ideas or materials and you have no right to compel such use. 

**Content Usage****Copyrights, Intellectual Property, Limited Permissions** 

The Wyoming Office of Tourism encourages the lawful use of its site content. The text, images, and data on the Site are protected by copyright and may be subject to other restrictions as well. The Wyoming Office of Tourism and relevant third-parties retain all rights, including copyright, in data, images, audio and video clips, software, documentation, text, and other information contained in these files (collectively, the “Materials”). Users may download and use Materials subject to these Terms and Conditions, and subject to any additional terms or restrictions applicable to the individual file or program, provided all copyright and other proprietary notices contained on the Materials are retained. 

The Materials are made available for use without permission only for limited non-commercial personal or educational use, for fair use as defined in the United States copyright laws, and for the specific use of the media and non- commercial/commercial providers of travel, tourism, leisure, arts, cultural and related information who, by their use of such content, promote the State of Wyoming as a travel destination and further the mission and goals of the Wyoming Office of Tourism. All users must cite the author/artist and source of this Material as they would material from any printed or other work, and the citation MUST include the URL “www.travelwyoming.com” in addition to all copyright and other proprietary notices included in the Materials. Non- commercial/commercial providers of travel, tourism, leisure, arts, culture and related information who choose to use such Materials must additionally notify the Wyoming Office of Tourism of such usage by contacting us and briefly detailing where, how, when and for what purpose the Materials are planned to be used.

The Wyoming Office of Tourism assumes no liability or responsibility for any errors or omissions in the content of the Site. 

**Trademarks** 

The trademarks, online logo marks and service marks (“the Trademarks”) displayed on the Site, including TravelWyoming.com, are registered and/or unregistered Trademarks of the Wyoming Office of Tourism and/or individual Site Partners.

**Kids Page** 

We at the State of Wyoming are especially concerned about protecting children’s privacy. We hope parents and teachers are involved in children’s Internet explorations. It is particularly important for parents to guide their children when children are asked to provide personal information online. We specifically ask children to get their parents’ permission before providing any information online, at our site or any other site, and hope parents will always be involved in those decisions. Most importantly, when children do provide information through the State of Wyoming website, it is only used to enable us to respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of children. 

**Disclaimer of Accuracy or Endorsement** 

Information on businesses and organizations within TravelWyoming.com is provided by those organizations, and is not endorsed by the Wyoming Office of Tourism. Users of this information are encouraged to call individual businesses to verify prices, amenities, features, dates, and all other important details before traveling. Additionally, these websites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

**Security** 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, the Wyoming Office of Tourism has put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Electronic communications and Internet transmissions are never completely private or secure. You understand that any message or information you send to the Site may be read or intercepted by others notwithstanding the security precautions put in place by the Wyoming Office of Tourism. Sending a message or any kind of electronic information to the Wyoming Office of Tourism does not cause the Wyoming Office of Tourism to have any special liability to you or any entity related to you. In the event the State of Wyoming and/or the Wyoming Office of Tourism should suffer a security breach we will comply with existing laws and inform the public via methods outlined in the Wyoming Office of Tourism’s crisis communication plan.
