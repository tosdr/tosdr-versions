* ● Email Address 
* ● Telephone Number 
* ● Pages that users access or visit 
* ● Or any combination of personal information that could be used to determine identity 

The information collected is used for internal review and may be used to improve the overall content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user, to notify users about updates to the Site and/or other Site related communications, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertisements.
