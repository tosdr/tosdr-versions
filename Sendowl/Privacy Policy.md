Privacy Policy
==============

**Last updated: June 17, 2024**

At SendOwl, we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share the personal information that we gather on the subdomains and websites on sendowl.com (the “Sites”) or through your use of our products and services. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy before submitting any personal data to us through our Sites. By continuing to use our Sites, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Concept Den Ltd. doing business as SendOwl will be the data controller of your personal data if you are a merchant using SendOwl to deliver products (“Merchant”) or a promoter of a Merchant’s product (“Affiliate”). Conversely, SendOwl will be the data processor if you are a customer to a SendOwl Merchant (“End Customer”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the way we process Merchants’ End Customer information in our role as a service provider to our Merchants. Our Data Processing Addendum, which describes how we process and safeguard Merchants’ End Customer information as a service provider to our Merchants, is available upon request by emailing [dpa-requests@sendowl.com](mailto:dpa-requests@sendowl.com).

If you are an End Customer to one of our Merchants, please contact your Merchant directly for information regarding how your Merchant uses and shares your personal information gathered from our services.

You can learn more about Stripe, our main payment processor, and read its privacy policy at [www.stripe.com/privacy](https://www.stripe.com/privacy).

**Information We Collect From Third Parties**. If you access our Sites through third parties (e.g., Facebook or Google), or if you share content from our Sites to a third party social media service, the third party service will send us certain information about you if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing. The information we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the third party service.

#### How We Use Information

#### How We Share Information

We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary equipment required to run the service and may share data with them accordingly in order to provide the services you have requested. Specifically: Cloudflare, Amazon Web Service, Rackspace, MailGun, Google Analytics, FreeAgent, HelpScout, Stripe and MailChimp.

#### How Do We Respond to ‘Do Not Track’ Signals?

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

#### Cookies

Cookies may use your IP address, timestamps, logins. Information collected from cookies is used by us to evaluate the effectiveness of our website, analyse trends, and administer our website.

#### Your Privacy Rights

If you would like to unsubscribe from receiving our newsletter, you can click on the “unsubscribe” link included in our email or contact us as indicated below.

**Exercising Your Privacy Rights**. We have listed the privacy rights for several jurisdictions below, but we understand you may have additional rights in your jurisdiction. You may contact us directly at any time about exercising your data protection rights. We will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.

**EEA or UK Individuals’ Rights**

If you are from the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, you have the right, under certain circumstances, to:

* Request access to your personal data.
* Request correction of your personal data.
* Request erasure of your personal data.
* Object to the processing of your personal data for reasons relating to your particular situation.
* Request restriction of processing your personal data.
* Request to export the personal data that we process based on our contract with you or your consent and transfer it to another company (if technically feasible).

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the details in the [Contact Us](https://www.sendowl.com/contact) section.

If you are not happy with our response, you can contact the ICO in the UK, or other data protection regulator in your country. Important note: if you are a customer who has been delivered a product via SendOwl you will need to contact the Merchant regarding your data rights. SendOwl acts as a data processor and it is the Merchant who must complete your data subject requests as your purchase contract is with them, not us.

**Additional Disclosures for Certain U.S. State Residents**

Certain state laws require that we detail the categories of personal information that we disclose for certain “business purposes,” such as to service providers that assist us with securing our services or marketing our products.

We disclose the following categories of personal information for our business purposes:

* Identifiers;
* Personal information under [California Civil Code section 1798.80](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1798.80.&lawCode=CIV);
* Commercial information;
* Internet activity information; and
* Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.

Several jurisdictions grant state residents certain rights, including the right to access specific types of personal information, the right to correct inaccurate personal information, the right to learn how we process personal information, the right to know whether and how we disclose or sell personal information, the right to opt out of any sale of personal information, the right to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, the right to limit our use of your sensitive personal information, and the right not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights.

To make such a request, please contact us using the contact details listed in the [Contact Us](https://www.sendowl.com/contact) section below.

**Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information**. Residents of certain U.S. states have the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information.

We do not sell your email address, shopping cart data, or other marketing information to third parties. However, under some U.S state laws, some sharing of personal information necessary to provide you with personalized ads may be considered a “sale,” even if no money is exchanged, such as our use of cookies and similar technologies. You may learn more about how to opt out of such personalized ads through our [Cookie Policy](https://www.sendowl.com/cookies).

**Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information**. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purpose other than providing our goods and services to you, or as otherwise permitted under applicable law.

**Third Party Marketing**. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

#### Legal Bases for Processing

Billing information is recorded as it is necessary to comply with our contractual obligations when providing our service to Merchants and our Merchants’ End Customers.

We process information about our visitors for the legitimate business interests of developing our site to ensure a better experience for our visitors. We also obtain registration information based on the legitimate interest of business administration. When processing your personal data for our legitimate interests, we take appropriate measures to ensure that the interests we pursue are balanced with your interests, rights and freedoms.

With your consent, we may use your personal data to send you marketing materials, except as otherwise permitted by applicable law. You may also provide consent where we do not rely on another legal basis. Consent may be withdrawn at any time.

We may process data in compliance with a mandatory legal obligation. For example, accounting and tax requirements, which are subject to mandatory retention periods. We may also collect your personal data to record your requests to exercise your rights and to verify your identity for such requests.

In some limited cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet law enforcement requirements, as described above in [How We Share Information](#3).

#### Retention and Withdrawal

We retain information from or about you for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. When the information is no longer necessary for these purposes, we delete it or keep it in a form that does not identify you, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrolment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.

#### Data Transfer

We may transfer your personal data to recipients in countries other than the country in which the personal data originally was collected. Those countries may not offer the same level of protection to your personal data. When we transfer your personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will comply with applicable legal requirements by providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal data, including by (i) entering into the European Commission’s EU Standard Contractual Clauses with the data recipients, (ii) verifying that the recipient has implemented Binding Corporate Rules, or (iii) any other appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law for any personal information transferred internationally.

To obtain a copy of our Data Protection Addendum with Standard Contractual Clauses incorporated, please email [dpa-requests@sendowl.com](mailto:dpa-requests@sendowl.com).

#### Children’s Privacy

The Sites are not directed at individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided in the [Contact Us](https://www.sendowl.com/contact) section below. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.

#### Change of Control

Personal information may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization or other change in control. If we sell, merge or transfer any part of the business, part of the sale may include your personal information.

#### Data Security

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. However, no website, application, or transmission can guarantee security. Thus, while we have established and maintain what we believe to be reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information obtained through the Sites, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.

#### Updates

This policy may be periodically updated. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to ensure you are familiar with the most current version. Please review carefully before submitting personal data to our site. The date the policy was last updated is indicated at the top of this page.

#### Contact Us

You can contact us at [support@sendowl.com](mailto:support@sendowl.com) if you have any questions regarding this privacy policy.
