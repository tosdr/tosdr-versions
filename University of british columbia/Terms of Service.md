Furthermore, some information on the Site has been provided by third parties and has not necessarily been verified by the University of British Columbia.
* **The University of British Columbia shall not be responsible for any direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damage or any other damages whatsoever and howsoever caused, arising out of or in connection with the use of the Site or in reliance on the information available on the Site, including the loss of use, lost data, lost business profits, business interruption, personal injury, or any other personal or pecuniary loss, whether the action is in contract, tort (including negligence) or other tortious action.**

**(c) No Endorsement**

* The Site may contain links to other sites. These links are provided as references to help you identify and locate other Internet resources that may be of interest. Parties other than the University of British Columbia independently develop and maintain these other sites. Therefore, the University of British Columbia does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or appropriateness of the information contained at such sites. In providing links to other sites, the University of British Columbia is not acting as a publisher or disseminator of the material contained on these other sites and does not seek to control the content of, or maintain any type of editorial control over, such sites.

In addition, the mention of another party or its product or services on the Site should not be construed as an endorsement of that party or its product or service.
