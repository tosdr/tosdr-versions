**FANJOY PRIVACY POLICY**

**_Last Updated_**_: January 26, 2018_

Fanjoy  Co.  (“**Fanjoy**,”  “**we**,”  “**us**,”  or  “**our**”)  respects  your  privacy.    This  Privacy  Policy  explains  how Fanjoy collects, uses, discloses, and secures information about you through our website at fanjoy.co (the “**Site**”),   and   our   related   web   sites,   networks,   applications,   mobile   applications,   our   electronic communications, including email and text messages, and other services provided by us (together with the Site, the “**Service**”).  By using the Service, you consent to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, now and as amended by us.

In providing  the  Service,  we  collect  and  obtain  information  about  individual  consumers  (“you”  or  “**End User**”) to, among other things, provide you with access to our e-commerce platform that allows fans to purchase merchandise relating to artists and influencers they admire. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the [Fanjoy Terms of Service. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy](https://fanjoy.co/pages/terms) Policy have the meaning given to them in the Fanjoy Terms of Service.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT** 

Fanjoy collects  information  from  and  about  users of  the  Service  in  a  variety of  ways.  This  information includes:

Information  You  Provide.   We  collect  information  you  provide  when  you  use  the  Service  or  otherwise communicate with us. If you register an account with us, we will collect the information you provide, such as your name, email address, and phone number. We will also collect any information you submit through your use of the Service. For example,  if  you are an End User, the information you provide can include your messaging  history and any information included  in your messages via the Service.   We may also collect information through your communications with our customer-support team.

Device,  Mobile  and  Usage  Information.  Like  most  online  services,  we  automatically  receive  standard technical, information when you interact with our Service including browser and device information such as  unique  device  identifiers,  mobile  phone  carrier,  internet protocol (IP) addresses (which may identify your  general geographic  location),  browser types,  and the  date and  time of  your  interactions. We also receive information about your interactions with our Service, such as which website pages you visited and how much time was spent on the page.

We may collect this information using cookies or similar technologies. Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on the hard drive or memory of your device.  Cookies enable us to personalize your experience on the Service, maintain a persistent session, passively collect demographic information, and monitor advertisements and other activities.  Our Service may use different kinds of cookies and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). We may also use software development kits (known as SDKs) or mobile advertising identifiers (for example, an “IDFA” on Apple mobile devices or an “Advertising ID” on Android mobile devices), which function similarly to cookies on mobile devices.  You may reset your IDFA or Advertising ID in the settings on your mobile device.

**Do Not Track.**  Currently, the Service is not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals sent from your browser.  For more information more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [www.allaboutdnt.org.](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/)

Information from Other Sources. We may obtain information from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners and advertisers.

 **HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

We use information (including your personal information) in a variety of ways to provide our Service and to operate our business, including the following:

Service Related Usage. We use the information we collect about and from you for a number of purposes, including:

* providing and supporting the Service,
* verifying your identity,
* analyzing how you use the Service,
* tailoring features and content to improve your experience with the Service,
* personalizing your  experience  with  the  Service  through  products,  services,  and  advertising

(including for third party products and services) that are relevant to your interests.

Communications.  We  use  your  information  to communicate with  you for  Service-related  purposes.  For example,  we  may send  email to the  email address you  provide  to  us  or  text  messages,  to  verify your account and for informational and operational purposes, such as account management, customer service, responding to questions or requests, system maintenance, and other Service-related purposes.  We may also use your information to send you newsletters and updates.

Improve our Service. We use the information that we collect (i) to understand and analyze usage trends and  preferences;  (ii)  to  monitor  and  analyze  the  effectiveness  of  our  Service;  and  (iii)  to  improve  our Service and develop new products, services, features, and functionality.

Marketing and Advertising. As permitted by applicable law, we may use information we collect about you for marketing and advertising purposes, such as providing  you with promotional materials (including for third party products and services) that may be useful, relevant,  valuable or otherwise of  interest to you which may be made available to you on or outside of the Service. Where required under applicable law, we’ll obtain your prior consent to send you electronic marketing communications.

**HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

We may share,  transfer,  or  disclose  your  information,  if  you consent  to  us  doing  so,  as well as  in the following circumstances: 

Service Providers. We share information (including your personal information) with our business partners and  service  providers  who  provide  services  to  us  or  to  you  (on  our  behalf),  such  as  web  site management, third party payment processors, information technology, and other similar service providers. We  also  may  share  your  information  (including  your  personal  information)  with  our  parent  company, subsidiaries, joint venturers, affiliates or investors.

Third Party and Affiliated Marketing Partners.   We may share, license or sell information (including your personal information) to third parties and affiliated marketing partners for their marketing or advertising purposes, including their online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., direct mail) marketing programs.

Advertising and Analytics Providers.   We also may provide personal information to advertising providers that you already may have relationships with (such as Facebook or Google) so that they can help us tailor our advertisements or reach you when you are on these third-party platforms. These advertising providers as well as our third-party analytics providers may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies  and  they  may  otherwise  collect  or  have  access  to  information  about  you,  including  your Device  and  Usage  Information.  This  Privacy  Policy  does  not  apply  to  the  activities  of  advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies outside of the Service.

Comply with Legal Requirements. We may disclose  your information as we believe  to be  necessary or appropriate to: (i) comply with applicable law and legal processes; (ii) respond to requests from public and government  authorities,  including  public  and  government  authorities outside  your  country of  residence; (iii)  enforce our  Terms of  Service; (iv) protect our rights, privacy,  safety, or property, and/or that of  our affiliates, you or others; and (v) allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

Corporate Transactions. We reserve the right to transfer your information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets.

Aggregate, De-Identified Information. We may use your data to create aggregate or statistical information that does not directly identify a specific person, and we may share that information. For example, we may share anonymous and aggregated reports and information on user demographics and traffic patterns with third parties.

Third  Party  Influencers.  We  may  share  information  collected  from  you  through  the  Service  with  the influencer  whose  merchandise  you  purchased  via  the  Service  for  their  internal  use  in compliance  with applicable  law.  As  permitted  by  applicable  law,  such  influencer  may  also  use  such  information  for marketing  purposes,  such  as  providing  you  with  promotional  materials  that  may  be  useful,  relevant, valuable  or  otherwise  of  interest  to  you.  Where  required  under  applicable  law,  we’ll  obtain  your  prior consent before permitting an influencer to send you electronic marketing communications.

**LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES**

The Service may contain links to other sites, maintained by third parties. These links are provided only as a convenience to you.  We or our subsidiaries and affiliated companies have no control over, and are not responsible for any content, products or services offered by or found on third party sites, or their privacy policies.  Links to third party sites do not constitute an assumption of liability for or sponsorship, endorsement or approval of these sites or the content contained on these sites.

**INFORMATION SECURITY**

We take steps in an effort to treat your information securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the  security  of  any  information  you  provide  to  us.    We  do  not  accept  liability  for  the  unintentional disclosure of your information and you acknowledge and agree that you use the Service and provide us with your information at your own risk.
