Privacy at Allianz

**1\. Introduction**
--------------------

Allianz cares about your personal data. Our mission is to ensure the Allianz’ privacy strategy and framework enable our businesses to maintain the trust of customers, employees and other stakeholders in our handling of personal data. We are committed to the highest standards of data protection and privacy compliance by handling personal data responsibly, transparently, with due care and in a fair and lawful manner. We use it only for specified and legitimate purposes and only keep it for as long as is needed. We never share it with anyone who is not authorized to access it.

We strive to communicate honestly and openly about actions that involve the personal data we process. We integrate data protection into the design of our products (privacy by design) and take appropriate steps to protect personal data and keep it secure

On this page, we would like to introduce you to our Privacy framework and activities.

_"Trust is an integral part of Allianz’s core values. We are committed to maintaining the trust of our employees, customers, and suppliers, and we believe that the protection and ethical use of data is important to achieve this."_

**Barbara Karuth-Zelle**  
Member of the Board  
Allianz SE

**2\. Privacy Principles at Allianz**
-------------------------------------

**Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**; We collect data only for a good reason, for example, if the individual has given their consent or to fulfil a contractual obligation. Individuals are informed in a clear manner how their data will be used.

**Purpose Limitation**; We limit the processing of personal data to only the purposes we’ve communicated to the individual.

**Data Minimisation**; We collect the smallest amount of data that is required to achieve the purposes stated.

**Accuracy**; Correct data is important to us, we have set up verification methods and provided channels for individuals to update their data with us.

**Storage Limitation**; Allianz has a standard for document management with retention schedules. We aim to only keep data for as long as necessary.

**Integrity and Confidentiality**; We take the security of data seriously, implementing technical and organizational security measures to mitigate risks.

**Accountability**; Allianz maintains documentation on how, where, why, personal data is processed to ensure that it can be presented as evidence of our responsibilities to supervisory authorities.

**3\. Privacy Governance at Allianz**
-------------------------------------

The Group Chief Privacy Officer reports directly to a Board Member and is supported by a team of 42 privacy professionals.

128 Privacy FTEs

To ensure compliance throughout the organization, Allianz has 128 Privacy FTEs all over the world.

2,500 Privacy champions

To further embed Privacy principles in the organization, the Privacy function is supported by 2,500 Privacy Champions

**4\. Allianz Sharing of Personal Data**
----------------------------------------

* **Internal:** Allianz has established security rules and controls surrounding the processing of personal data. Only those authorized will be able to process such data.
* **Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)**: As Allianz is a large multinational company, there needs to be a mechanism to transfer personal data across borders while staying in compliance with EEA data privacy and protection laws and regulations. The Allianz Binding Corporate Rules ("BCRs") provides this mechanism and were approved by the national data protection authorities in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). These authorities include the lead data protection authority for the Allianz Group, the Bavarian Data Protection Authority ("BayLDA"). 
* **External**: For transfers of data outside the Allianz Group, Data Processing Agreements are required to ensure that the recipient has adequate data protection levels and measures in place.

**5\. Data Ethics** 
--------------------

* Allianz strives to conduct data-driven business as a trustworthy and ethical partner to our customers. We have put a range of initiatives in place, such as the 2021 establishment of our Data Advisory Board. With top management represented among its membership, the DAB aims to elevate data ethics and selected data and analytics-related topics in the governance and decision-making processes of Allianz Group.
* Our approach includes implementing a responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our business activities, going beyond compliance with all applicable laws and regulations such as the GDPR. We embed best practices by ensuring that our usage of AI systems is human centric.
* Our Allianz Practical Guidance for AI serves as a guide to our core principles for the responsible usage of AI: Transparency, Privacy and Data Governance, Human Agency and Control, Fairness and Non-Discrimination, and Accountability. We take a risk-based approach to implementing the appropriate level of human involvement in each AI use case which processes personal data via the Privacy and Ethics Impact Assessment. All relevant employees who develop or use AI solutions are trained on the Responsible AI approach taken in the Practical Guidance for AI.

**6\. How we ensure Privacy compliance**

* Privacy by Design and Default
* Records of Processing Activities and Privacy Impact Assessments
* Self-assessments and independent on-site reviews

**Some tips to give you even more protection**
----------------------------------------------

**Minimize** the personal data you provide.

**Carefully read privacy notices** and clarify points that are unclear.

**Make your data privacy choices** (opt-in/opt-out) regarding the use of your personal data.

**Use pseudonyms** whenever this is possible.

**Watch out for phishing attempts** (a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker). How you can identify this:

**4\. Are cookies used on the Allianz website?**
------------------------------------------------

Tracking technology helps us manage and improve the usability of the Allianz Website, for example by detecting whether there has been any contact between your computer and us in the past and to identify the most popular sections of the Allianz Website.

Based on a more detailed description on the usage of cookies our Cookies Management Tool helps you to manage your cookies preferences including providing consent. The link to the respective Cookies Management Tool you find below. You can withdraw   your consent to the usage of certain cookies any time using the before mentioned tool.

When you save your cookie settings, they should also apply to your future visits to the Allianz Website. However, for technical reasons beyond the control of Allianz, this cannot be guaranteed.

**5\. How are social media plug-ins used on the Allianz Website?**
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Allianz Website uses the following social media plug-ins ("plug-ins"):

* Share button and learn more button on Facebook and Instagram, powered by Meta Inc., 1601 S. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA
* Tweet button, powered by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA
* Button Xing, operated by XING AG, Gänsemarkt 43, 20354 Hamburg, Germany
* Share Button on LinkedIn, operated by LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States
* YouTube Plugin, powered by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland
* Learn more on TikTok, by TikTok, 5800 Bristol Pkwy, Culver City, United States

All social media links and plug-ins (YouTube plugin) are indicated with the brand names of the respective providers Facebook, Twitter, Xing, LinkedIn and Google ("Provider"). To increase the level of data protection and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations for plugins, we have implemented additional programs by means of a so-called consent solution. This procedure ensures that when you visit the Allianz Website, no direct connection of your browser to the servers of the Provider is established.

Only if you grant your consent to the data transfer in the cookie consent preferences for the YouTube plugin or by clicking  the direct links for social media, your browser establishes a direct connection to the server of the respective Provider. The Provider receives the information that your browser has accessed the Allianz Website. The content of the plug-in or social media providers is then transmitted by the Providers directly to your browser.

If you interact with the plug-in, e.g. by playing an imbedded YouTube video, the data will be transferred directly from your browser to the Provider and saved by the Provider.

Your personal data may be processed both inside and outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) by the parties specified above, subject always to contractual restrictions regarding confidentiality and security in line with applicable data protection laws and regulations. We will not disclose your personal data to parties who are not authorized to process them.

Whenever we transfer your personal data for processing outside of the EEA by another Allianz company, we will do so on the basis of the binding corporate rules (BCRs) of Allianz which establish adequate protection for personal data and are legally binding on Allianz Group companies. The public version of the BCRs and the list of Allianz Group companies that comply with them can be accessed [here](https://www.allianz.com/en/privacy-statement.html#bcrcompanies).

### **10\. How do we treat electronic messages sent to and from Allianz?**

All electronic messages sent to and from Allianz are protected by reasonable technical and organizational measures and may only be accessed in justified cases in line with applicable laws and regulations (e.g. court order, suspicion of criminal conduct, violation of regulatory obligations) to specific persons in defined functions (e.g. Legal, Compliance, Risk). Every step of the process, as well as the search criteria used, are logged in an audit trail. All emails are disposed of after the applicable retention period has expired.

### **11\. What should you consider when sending data over the Internet?**

The Internet is generally not regarded as a secure environment, and information sent via the Internet (such as to or from the Allianz Website or via electronic message) may be accessed by unauthorized third parties, potentially leading to disclosures, changes in content or technical failures. Even if both sender and receiver are located in the same country, information sent via the Internet may be transmitted across international borders and be forwarded to a country with a lower data protection level than in your country of residence.

Allianz does not accept responsibility or liability for the security of your information whilst in transit over the Internet to Allianz. In order to protect your privacy you may choose another means of communication with Allianz, where you deem it appropriate.
