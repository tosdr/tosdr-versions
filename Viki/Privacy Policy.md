            For cookies and similar technologies, you may withdraw your consent at any time by adjusting your preferences as further explained in Section 5 or by contacting us via the means provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

        3. Legitimate Interests
            
            We use your Personal Information for our legitimate interests to:
            
            1. Understand how you use the Rakuten Viki Service;
            2. Personalise the Rakuten Viki Service for you;
            3. Improve the Rakuten Viki Service for all users;

            5. Share information with Rakuten Affiliates for internal administration.
            
            Service improvements are dependent on our analyzing, for example, how you use the Rakuten Viki Service (such as pages you view, the rate at which you consume content (how often, and for how long), content you prefer and searches you make or share, the content you liked, comments you leave, third-party websites you visit through links, the success rate of any promotion, marketing campaign, or event, certain technical information about your device, or when you access the Rakuten Viki Service through a certain device, and purchase path or transaction data) and any issues or problems reported to customer service. In circumstances where we process personal data to serve our legitimate interests, we put in place robust safeguards to ensure that your privacy is protected and ensure that our legitimate interests do not override your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. You have a right to object to any of these uses except where our compelling interest outweighs your concerns, such as our interest in ensuring the security of the Rakuten Viki Service for all users. You may exercise your right to Object as described in Section 5.
            
        
    2. Additional Legal Basis for EU and UK
        1. Legal obligation and public interest
            
            In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect or disclose your Personal Information, or may otherwise need to use or disclose your Personal Information, to protect your vital interests or those of another person, or to assert, protect or defend our or a third party’s legal rights.
            
    3. Additional Legal Bases for Brazil
        1. Legal obligations, legal proceedings and performance of public statutory duties
            
            We may use your Personal Information to comply with our legal obligations, in connection with legal proceedings, to assert, protect or defend our or a third party’s legal rights, or to perform public statutory duties we are subject to.
            
4. **HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION**
    1. We may disclose your Personal Information for business purposes to the following parties:
        1. Service providers
            
            We share your Personal Information with our service providers that perform business services and/or operations on our behalf according to our instruction. For example, we may engage other companies to process secure payments, provide authentication services, detect and prevent fraud, abuse and other malicious online activities on the Rakuten Viki Service, provide streaming and content delivery services, fulfil orders, perform analytics, facilitate direct marketing communications, administer our promotions and surveys, and support service email and messaging services.
            
        2. Business partners
            
            We share your Personal Information with Our Partners to carry out marketing activities and perform business services depending upon your selected subscription plan and/or your request to use certain features. For example, we partner with other companies to provide content, and targeted advertising services on third-party platforms, subject to your consent or opt-out, as applicable in your jurisdiction.
            
        3. Third-Party Advertisers
            
            We permit advertisements to be delivered to you on the Rakuten Viki Service by third-party advertisers (also called ad networks or network advertisers). Subject to your consent or opt-out, depending on your jurisdiction (see Section 5), advertisements may be tailored to your interests by the third-party advertisers based on preferences inferred from information they collect about your behavior on other sites and services, as well as Personal Information we may share with them about your interactions with the Rakuten Viki Services. In California in particular, the law identifies Personal Information disclosure for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising as a “sale” or “sharing” regardless of whether money is exchanged for it. In other jurisdictions, this is identified as processing for the purposes of targeted advertising. Subject to your opt-out or consent as may be applicable in your jurisdiction, we share the following types of Personal Information, where available, with these third-party advertisers for the purposes of their ad delivery, ad measurement, and cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising on the Rakuten Viki Services: identifiers (e.g., IP address, device ID, ad ID, user agent), location data inferred from IP address, the genres of content you engage with, and cookie data.
            
            Other than the Personal Information we may share with them according to our contractual terms, we have no control over any other Personal Information these third-party advertisers collect elsewhere or may use to target advertisements to you, and we assume no responsibility for their privacy practices.
            
        4. Rakuten Group companies
            
            Rakuten Group, Inc. is Rakuten Viki’s parent company. We work closely with our affiliated businesses and companies that fall under the Rakuten Group family (together, “Rakuten Affiliates”). We may share your data with Rakuten Affiliates for internal business administration purposes within the Rakuten Group.
            
            In addition, the Rakuten Group aims to provide you with a common service experience through the “Rakuten ID”, a program that enables you to use the same log-in credentials with any participating Rakuten Group services you use. Viki will securely share your account credentials with the Rakuten ID program for future account authentication purposes, according to the terms explained in the Rakuten ID Privacy Policy here: [https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/rakuten-id.html](https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/rakuten-id.html), for use if you choose to connect to another Rakuten ID participating service in addition to the Rakuten Viki Service.
            
        5. Law enforcement agencies, courts, regulators and government authorities
            
            We may share your Personal Information with these parties where we assess and reasonably believe this is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise assert, protect or defend our or a third party’s legal rights; and
            
        6. Asset purchasers
            
            We may share your Personal Information with any third-party that purchases, or to which we transfer, all or a relevant portion of our assets and business. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which we transfer your Personal Information uses it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
            
    2. The following categories of Personal Information may be shared with the parties listed above for the purposes described, except where otherwise specified above:
        1. Identifiers;
        2. Commercial information;
        3. General location data inferred from IP address;
        4. Other device information;
        5. Internet or other electronic network activity information;
        6. Cookies; and
        7. Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.
    3. Note about third-party websites
        
        The Rakuten Viki Service may contain links to other third-party websites that we neither control nor own. We encourage you to be aware of when you are visiting these other third-party websites and to understand their privacy statements, as we have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the data collection, privacy practices or the content of any of these third-party sites you may choose to visit.

    2. Your Privacy rights
        
        You may have certain rights regarding Personal Information based on where you reside (“Privacy Rights”), in accordance with applicable law and limitations, as described below. If you would like to exercise such rights, send us an email at [privacy@viki.com](mailto:privacy@viki.com), or if you are a resident of certain U.S. states, by using the web form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc7DvNdohyifLieWNF7V2ZqNIAJXHGkDD-lIrDT8vubBhKoA/viewform?usp=sf_link), and ensure to include the statement “Your U.S. State Privacy Rights” in the body of your request.

An agent may submit requests on your behalf, provided you or your agent provide proof that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf. Please note that we may require additional information from you in order to verify your identity and honor your requests.
        
        1. General Privacy Rights, including the right to request to:
            1. **Know or confirm** that we are processing personal data concerning you, including the categories of personal data, the purposes of processing, and the categories of recipients to whom we disclose it or in some cases the list of specific third parties to whom we disclosed personal data;
            2. **Access** your Personal Information that we process or receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you;

            5. **Object** to our use of your Personal Information under certain circumstances, such as when our use is based on our non-compelling legitimate interests or is used for direct marketing purposes. You can unsubscribe or opt out of receiving direct marketing communications from us by using the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of an email, by modifying your notification preferences in your “Subscription & Settings”, or by contacting us. Please note that even if you opt-out of receiving marketing communications, we may continue to send you non-marketing emails and other types of communications, as permitted by law, such as responses to your support requests, updates to our policies, or emails relating to your Rakuten Viki Service account;
            6. **Restrict** our use and limit our processing of your Personal Information to particular purposes. You can request to restrict our use of Personal Information during the pendency of your objection to our use for legitimate interests, or when alleging that our use of Personal Information is unlawful or no longer necessary for the purpose;
            7. **Withdraw your consent** for any processing that is based on your consent;
            8. **Port your data** - Receive a copy of Personal Information you provided us in an electronic format and/or have us transmit it to an external party – (right to data portability);
            9. Exercise privacy rights without fear of being denied goods or services or discrimination. We may, however, provide a different level of service where such Personal Information is necessary to provide the additional features or functionality; and
            10. **Lodge a complaint** – if contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you have the right to make a complaint to your data protection authority.
        2. Additional Privacy Rights applicable to users in California:
            
            If you are a California resident, you also have the right to:
            
            1. **Know** the categories of sources from which we collected the information, the categories of your Personal Information that we disclosed, sold or shared, and our business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing the information.
            2. **Opt-out of the sale or “sharing”** of your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising – we disclose certain Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising which California law defines as a “sale” or “share”. You may exercise your right to opt-out by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” button at the bottom of our Site. For California and Colorado residents, we recognize valid opt-out preference signals sent from browsers or devices, including the Global Privacy Control. When we receive such signals that do not conflict with your existing privacy preferences, we will automatically exercise opt-out rights that may be available to you under California laws, such as the rights to opt out of sale, sharing, and processing your Personal Information for targeted advertising. One way that you can use such opt-out signals is by following the instructions for your device or browser located [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).
            3. **“Shine the Light”**: residents of California may request information once per calendar year about our disclosures, if any, of certain categories of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes under California’s “Shine the Light” law.
            4. **Understand our use of financial incentives** provided in exchange for Personal Information. California Notice of Financial Incentives: California law requires certain disclosures related to financial incentive offerings, including in relation to the value of your consumer data to our business. We may offer an opportunity to sign up to receive interest-based content via email by providing us your name, email address, or other personal contact information. There is no obligation to opt-in, and you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions in the mailing. From time to time, we may offer a financial incentive to those who sign up for or remain on our mailing list, complete a market research survey, make a purchase, or do not complete a purchase, such as a discount coupon or an opportunity to win a prize or giveaway in a random drawing. The details of each incentive program will be contained in the program terms. We offer these programs, among other things, to enhance our relationship with you, to provide you with content that may be of interest to you, and/or so you can enjoy more of our products/services at a lower price. Although we do not calculate the value of consumer data to our business in our accounting statements, we make the following good faith estimate for California residents to use in making an informed decision whether or not to take advantage of any financial incentive or price or service difference we may offer that relates to the collection, retention or sale of your personal information: To the extent we create overall value for our business from our financial incentive marketing programs that could be directly or reasonably related to the value of customer data, that value would vary from program to program and among individuals, but our method for calculating this value to our business would include, for each program, and in the aggregate, whether and by what amount the sales generated by the program(s) exceed the cost to us of offering them, which would include costs associated with (1) any financial incentives that are paid to consumers; (2) the cost of the marketing and distribution of the offer; (3) our marketing team’s efforts to enhance the resulting consumer data through campaign optimization and consumer engagement at sufficient scale; (4) leveraging our past investments in understanding consumers as our existing and future customers; (5) collecting and maintaining data as intellectual property; and (6) all other costs reasonably related to the programs.
        3. Additional rights applicable to residents of certain U.S. states other than California:
            
            If you are a resident of certain U.S. states other than California, you also have the right to:
            
            1. **Opt-out of Processing for Targeted Advertising Purposes** – we make certain disclosures of Personal Information that are used for targeted advertising. You may opt out of your Personal Information being processed for targeted advertising purposes by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” button at the bottom of our Site.
            2. **Appeal** our decision regarding your privacy rights request, by submitting an e-mail to [privacy@viki.com](mailto:privacy@viki.com) with a subject heading “PRIVACY APPEAL” and setting out the details of your appeal and the reasons you think it should be granted.
6. **AUTOMATED DECISIONS ABOUT YOU**
    
    We may use software programs, algorithms, machine learning or artificial intelligence to make automated decisions about you based on your Personal Information to, for example, show you personalised content and select personalised offers, discounts, marketing communications or recommendations to send you based on your order history, browsing history, preferences, location, device type and means of payment. These types of automated decisions will not have legal or similarly significant effects for you, but you can still contact us for further information on these decisions.
    
7. **INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**
    
    Please note that your Personal Information may need to be transferred to, stored and/or processed in countries where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in your home country. We may transfer to, store and/or otherwise process your Personal Information in the United States, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Brazil, Netherlands and India. In such cases, we will require the recipient to provide appropriate protection for the Personal Information disclosed to it in compliance with applicable data protection laws. As part of the Rakuten Group, we rely on Rakuten’s EU Binding Corporate Rules and UK Binding Corporate Rules to safeguard international data transfers of EU and UK Personal Information within the group. Rakuten’s EU Binding Corporate Rules have been approved by the CNPD, the Data Protection Authority of Luxembourg and the UK Binding Corporate Rules have been approved by the ICO, the Data Protection Authority of the UK. The aforementioned Binding Corporate Rules can be found at [https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/bcr.html](https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/bcr.html).
    
8. **SECURITY**
    
    We care about the security of your Personal Information. We implement technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing for the Personal Information we process. These measures are aimed at ensuring the on-going integrity and confidentiality of your Personal Information. However, no company can guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. You are also responsible to make sure that your Personal Information is accurate and that your password is unique, secure and not shared with any third-party.
    
9. **RETENTION**
    
    Unless otherwise specified, we will keep your account Personal Information for as long as we have a relationship with you, i.e., while you have an active account with us.
    
    In addition, we will retain your Personal Information outside the normal retention times to the extent there is a need to retain the data to pursue, defend, or exercise a legal right or claim, or if we are required to do so to comply with applicable legal obligations or regulatory requirements.
    
10. **CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**
    
    The Rakuten Viki Service is not intended for children (a) under the age of 18, (b) under the age of majority in any state, territory or country of residence from which the Rakuten Viki Service is accessed, or (c) under any other prescribed minimum age for providing consent to data collection under local law. Our registration requires the user to certify that they are above the age of 18 and above the age of majority in their home territory. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information via the Rakuten Viki Service from anyone under the age of 18 or under the age of majority in the relevant state, territory or country of residence. If you are a parent or a guardian who believes that your child/ward who is under the age of 18 or under the age of majority in your state, territory or country of residence, has improperly provided us with their Personal Information, please contact us at [privacy@viki.com](mailto:privacy@viki.com) to remedy this situation.
    
11. **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**
    
    We may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version will govern our use of your Personal Information and is available at [viki.com/privacy](https://www.viki.com/legal/privacy), with the latest update date at the top of this Privacy Policy. Older versions are available upon request. Any revised Privacy Policy is effective upon posting. If we make changes, we will provide you notice of such changes, such as by sending an email, posting to the Site, providing a notice through the Rakuten Viki Services or other reasonable means. In addition, if we make changes that we believe materially impact your rights, if applicable, we will ask you to consent to the changes.
