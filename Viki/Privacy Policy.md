4. HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION
    1. We may disclose your Personal Information for business purposes to the following parties:
        1. Service providers
            
            We share your Personal Information with Our service providers that perform business services and/or operations on Our behalf. For example, We may engage other companies to process secure payments, provide authentication services, detect and prevent fraud, abuse and other malicious online activities on the Rakuten Viki Service, provide streaming and content delivery services, fulfil orders, perform analytics, send direct marketing communications, administer Our promotions and surveys, and support service email and messaging services;
            
        2. Business partners
            
            We may share your Personal Information with Our Partners to carry out marketing activities and perform business services depending upon your selected subscription plan and/or your request. For example, We may partner with other companies to provide content, and targeted advertising services;
            
        3. Third-Party Advertisers
            
            We permit advertisements to be delivered to you on the Rakuten Viki Service by third-party advertisers (also called ad networks or network advertisers). Subject to your right to consent or opt-out, depending on your jurisdiction, these advertisements may be tailored to your interests by the third-party advertisers based on preferences inferred from information they collect about your behavior on other sites and services, as well as Personal Information we may share with them about your interactions with the Rakuten Viki Services and Our Site. In California in particular, the law identifies Personal Information disclosure for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising as a “sale” or “sharing” regardless of whether money is exchanged for it. In other jurisdictions, this is identified as processing for the purposes of targeted advertising. To the extent required by your jurisdiction’s law, we offer you an option to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information or the processing of your Personal Information for the purposes of targeted advertising or we do not enable a marketing cookie to be placed or read without your prior consent (see Section 5: Opt-outs). Subject to your opt-out or consent, as may be applicable in your jurisdiction, we share the following types of Personal Information, where available, with these third-party advertisers for the purposes of their ad delivery, ad measurement, and cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising: identifiers (e.g., IP address, device ID, ad ID, user agent), location data, and cookie data.
            
            Other than the Personal Information we may share with them according to our contractual terms, we have no control over any other Personal Information these third-party advertisers collect elsewhere or may use to target advertisements to you and we assume no responsibility for their privacy practices. For more information about how the online advertising industry uses information it collects to provide you with tailored advertisement, and to control broadly whether you want to receive relevant advertisements from third-party advertisers, please review the information at the following links: [The Network Advertising Initiative](https://thenai.org/opt-out/); and [Your Ad Choices](https://youradchoices.com/);
            
        4. Rakuten Group companies
            
            Rakuten Group, Inc. is Rakuten Viki’s parent company. We work closely with Our affiliated businesses and companies that fall under the Rakuten Group family (together, “Rakuten Affiliates”). We may share your data with Rakuten Affiliates for internal business administration purposes within the Rakuten Group.
            
            In addition, the Rakuten Group aims to provide you with a common service experience through the “Rakuten ID”, a program that enables you to use the same username and password to log in to participating Rakuten Group services to which you choose to connect. If you choose to connect to another Rakuten ID participating service in addition to the Rakuten Viki Service, you authorize certain of your Personal Information (specifically, your email address) to be shared from Rakuten Viki to the Rakuten ID program and the other Rakuten service according to the terms of and for the purposes explained in Our joint Rakuten ID Privacy Policy here: [https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/rakuten-id.html](https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/rakuten-id.html);
            
        5. Law enforcement agencies, courts, regulators and government authorities
            
            We may share your Personal Information with these parties where We believe this is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect or assert Our rights or the rights of any third party; and
            
        6. Asset purchasers
            
            We may share your Personal Information with any third-party that purchases, or to which We transfer, all or a relevant portion of Our assets and business. Should such a sale or transfer occur, We will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which We transfer your Personal Information uses it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
            
    2. The following categories of Personal Information may be shared with the parties listed above for the purposes described, except where otherwise specified above:
