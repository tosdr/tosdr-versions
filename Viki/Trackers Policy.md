4. **DOES RAKUTEN VIKI RESPOND TO 'DO NOT TRACK' SIGNALS?**
    
    Rakuten Viki does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.
    
5. **WHAT TO DO IF YOU DO NOT WANT COOKIES TO BE SET OR WANT THEM TO BE REMOVED?**
    
    If you do not want the Site to collect information through the use of cookies, you can set your web browser to reject cookies from the Site. Each browser is different, so you should check your browser or device's “Help” menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
    
    You may also disable analytics for mobile applications from the settings screen on your mobile device. In addition, you can manage and delete cookies placed by internet based advertising companies through [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/) in the US, or [All About Cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) or [Your Online Choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) in the EU. In addition, you can change your device settings, on your iPhone, iPad or Android, to control whether you see online internet based ads.
    
    You should note that if you reject or block cookies from the Site, the Site may not function as intended. For example, We may not be able to store your preferences or login information or customize the content to your viewing habits.
    
6. **CHANGES TO THIS COOKIE POLICY**
    
    From time to time, We may update this Cookie Policy in order to reflect changes, such as changes to the cookies We use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about Our use of cookies and related technologies.
