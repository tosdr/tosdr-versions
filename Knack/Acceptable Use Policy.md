By Knack: Knack will indemnify, defend and hold Customer harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements (collectively, “Losses”) incurred by Customer arising out of any third-party claim that the Services delivered under this Agreement infringe any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of a third party. If the Services or any part thereof becomes the subject of a valid claim of infringement under any patent, copyright or trade secret law, Knack will either procure the right, at Knack’s sole expense, to permit Customer continued use of the Services, or replace or modify the Services so as to avoid infringement without materially altering the functionality and performance thereof. If Knack reasonably and in good faith determines that neither of the foregoing are commercially practicable, Knack may terminate this Agreement and the licenses granted herein effective immediately upon written notice to Customer and will refund the unearned pro-rata portion of any prepaid amounts.

    3. Process: The indemnification obligations set forth herein are contingent upon the following conditions:
        1. Knack or Customer, as the case may be (the **“Indemnified Party”**) must promptly notify the other party (the **“Indemnifying Party”**) in writing of the third party claim or action (however, failure of the Indemnified Party to so promptly notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent it has been damaged thereby)
        2. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of the matter
        3. The Indemnifying Party will have sole control of the defense of the action and negotiations for its settlement and compromise; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost, obtain separate counsel to represent its interests.

THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.
12. **FORCE MAJEURE**

Neither party shall be under any liability to the other for any delay in performing any obligation under this Agreement to the extent caused by reason of circumstances beyond the reasonable control of that party and without such party’s fault or negligence, which shall include but not be limited to acts of God, war, strikes, lack or failure of transportation facilities, acts of terrorism, fire, acts of government authority. In the event of a force majeure event, the affected party shall give prompt written notice to the other party, stating the period of time the same is expected to continue. If any such failure or delay in performance continues for more than sixty (60) days, either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other.

Alternatively, either party may give notice by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the address provided to the other party during the registration and provisioning process. In such case, notice shall be deemed given three (3) days after the date of mailing.

15. **GOVERNING LAW; EXPORT COMPLIANCE**

    2. The Services may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Customer may not permit users to access or use the Services in a U.S.- embargoed country or in violation of any U.S. export law or regulation, or in a manner that causes Knack to be in violation of U.S. export laws, even if the use is permitted the laws applicable to you or your user or customer. Each party represents that it is not on any restricted persons list maintained by the U.S., Canada, or any member of the European Union.
16. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY**
    1. This Agreement, together with the applicable Order(s) comprises the entire agreement between Customer and Knack with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.

Any pre-printed terms and conditions on or attached to Customer purchase orders will be of no force or effect. 
    2. If one or more of the paragraphs in this Agreement are found to be unenforceable or invalid, the remaining paragraphs shall remain in effect.
17. **ASSIGNMENT**

This Agreement may not be assigned by a party without the prior written consent of the other party unless such assignment is to (i) its parent or subsidiary; (ii) an acquirer of substantially all of its stock or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger.  Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void. Any actual or proposed change in control of Customer that results or would result in a direct competitor of Knack directly or indirectly owning or controlling 50% or more of Customer shall entitle Knack to terminate this Agreement for cause immediately upon written notice.

18. **AUTHORITY**

If this Agreement is being accepted by any individual for Customer, then Customer represents, warrants and attests that such individual has the authority to execute this Agreement on behalf of Customer.

19. **UPDATES**

Knack may amend this Agreement from time to time, and the revised terms shall be effective upon the commencement of the next Renewal Term (as defined in the applicable Order). Any such revisions will apply to Knack’s customers generally, will not impose additional fees during the applicable Term, or alter the allocation of risk between you and Knack.

20. **PUBLICITY**
