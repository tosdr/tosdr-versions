Think of a record like a row in a spreadsheet or database table. Your record storage is the combined number of records that are stored in all of your databases.

The total amount of files and images you can upload to your online database.

The number of apps you can build.

We can review your idea in detail and consult on the best way to translate your requirements into a functional app.

The number of builders (including you) who can access your Knack account to edit and build applications.

Users can log in to access your app. There is no user limit or per-user license — each user simply counts as a database record.

Add a checkout to any form to capture E-Commerce charges. Integrates seamlessly with your database.

Use reports to analyze your data with Pivot Tables and Line or Pie charts.

Developers can use the Knack RESTful API to securely access your data and extend your app functionality.

Removal of “Powered by Knack” link at the bottom of the live app.

Emails sent from apps can be configured to originate from your domain.

Add specific IP addresses that can access the app. All others are blocked.

Schedule tasks to update your records and send emails.

Use Geo-Location to search for records by zip code and location.

SSO – Single Sign-On. Allow your users to log in with 3rd-party accounts. Basic includes Google, Facebook, Twitter, and OpenID. Advanced includes custom SSO providers and domain limiting.

View a history of each change to your records, including the change author, IP address, and highlights of changes. Retention period for this data varies by plan.

We know some of the terms may be unfamiliar. We have some more info [here](https://www.knack.com/blog/online-database-definitions/) on some of the common database terms.
