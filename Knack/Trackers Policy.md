Cookies
=======

Cookies and how they benefit you
--------------------------------

Our website uses cookies, as almost all websites do, to help provide you with the best experience we can. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile phone when you browse websites.

**Our cookies help us:**

* Make our website work as you’d expect
* Save you from having to login every time you visit the site
* Allow you to share pages with social networks like Facebook
* Continuously improve our website for you
* Make our marketing more efficient (ultimately helping us to offer the service we do at the price we do)

**We do not use cookies to:**

* Collect any personally identifiable information (without your express permission)
* Collect any sensitive information (without your express permission)
* Pass personally identifiable data to third parties

You can learn more about all the cookies we use below.

Granting us permission to use cookies
-------------------------------------

If the settings on the software that you are using to view this website (your browser) are adjusted to accept cookies, we take this, and your continued use of our website, to mean that you are fine with this and granting us permission to use cookies. Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site you can learn how to do this below, however doing so will likely mean that our site will not work as you would expect.

More about our cookies
----------------------

**We use cookies to make our website work including:**

* Determining if you are logged in or not
* Allowing you to add comments or posts in our forums
* Allowing you to submit support communications to our team
* Remembering if we have already asked you certain questions (e.g. you declined to accept our Cookie Policy)

Social Website Cookies
----------------------

So you can easily “Like” or share our content on the likes of Facebook and Twitter we have included sharing buttons on our Blog.

**We Use:**

ShareThis – This provides us with lots of sharing buttons all in one neat package.

The privacy implications on this will vary from social network to social network and will be dependent on the privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.

Site Improvement Cookies
------------------------

We regularly test new designs or site features on our site. We do this by showing slightly different versions of our website to different people and anonymously monitoring how our site visitors respond to these different versions. Ultimately this helps us to offer you a better website.

**We Use:**

Anonymous Visitor Statistics Cookies – We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn’t working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These so called “analytics” programs also tell us if how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing spend.

DoubleClick – Privacy Policy owned by Google

Remarketing Cookies – You may notice that sometimes after visiting a site you see increased numbers of advertisements from the site you visited. This is because advertisers, including ourselves pay for these adverts. The technology to do this is made possible by cookies and as such we may place a so called “remarketing cookie” during your visit. We use these adverts to offer special offers etc to encourage you to come back to our site. Don’t worry we are unable to proactively reach out to you as the whole process is entirely anonymised. You can opt out of these cookies at anytime as explained above. For more information on this, take a look [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.google.com/dcm/partner/answer/2839090?hl%3Den&sa=D&ust=1526959845904000&usg=AFQjCNH3KReydQS5FlbeuhvPDCx45PtaRQ).

Affiliate Cookies – We have a number of partners who promote our service on a success-only basis (i.e. instead of paying for advertising, we pay them commissions on sales). Cookies are required to allow us to reward these partners and these cookies are usually provided by specialist companies (known as affiliate networks). Neither us, the networks, or the partner advertising or recommending our services are able to identify you personally. We ask you to support us by allowing these cookies which ultimately help us to offer you the service we do at the price we do. Our affiliate cookies are stored in your browser from us under the knack.com domain.

Turning Cookies Off
-------------------

You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies. Doing so however will likely limit the functionality of our’s and a large proportion of the world’s websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites

It may be that you are concerned about cookies so called “spyware”. Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.
