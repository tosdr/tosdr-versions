9. TRADING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES



Placing of instructions



You may give us instructions in electronic form through the Company Online Trading System. If any

instructions are received by us by computer or other medium we may ask you to confirm such instructions

in writing. We shall be authorised to follow instructions notwithstanding your failure to confirm them in

writing. In this Agreement “instructions” and “orders” have the same meaning.



Types of Orders Accepted



Some of the types of orders The Company accepts include, but are not limited to:



a. Good till Cancelled (“GTC”)- An order (other than a market order), that by its terms is effective

until filled or cancelled by Customer. GTC Orders do not automatically cancel at the end of the

Business Day on which they are placed.

b. Limit- An order (other than a market order) to buy or sell the identified market at a specified price.

A limit order to buy generally will be executed when the ask price equals or falls below the bid price

that you specify in the limit order. A limit order to sell generally will be executed when the bid price

equals or exceeds the ask price that you specify in the limit order.

c. Market- An order to buy or sell the identified market at the current market price that The Company

provides via the Online Trading System. An order to buy is executed at the current market ask price

and an order to sell is executed at the current market bid price.

d. One Cancels the Other (“OCO”)- An order that is linked to another order. If one of the orders is

executed, the other will be automatically cancelled.

e. Stop Loss- A stop loss order is an instruction to buy or sell a market at a price which is lower than

the opening price of an open position (or lower than the prevailing price when applying the stop

loss order to an already open position). It can be used to help protect against losses. Please note

that because of market gapping, the best available price that may be achieved could be materially

different to the price set on the stop loss order and as such, stop loss orders are not guaranteed to

take effect at the price for which they are set.

19



f. Trailing Stop- A trailing stop is the same as a stop loss order with the only difference being that,

instead of setting a price at which the order is activated, the trailing stop order is activated at a

fixed distance from the market price. For example, if Customer has purchased a long open position

and the market ask price increases, the trailing stop price will also increase and will trail behind

the market ask price at the fixed distance set by Customer. If the market ask price then decreases,

the trailing stop price will remain fixed at its last position and if the market ask price reaches the

trailing stop price, the order will be executed. Please note that because of market gapping, the best

available price that may be achieved could be materially different to the price set on the trailing

stop order and as such, trailing stop orders are not guaranteed to take effect at the fixed distance

for which they are set.



Following submission of an order, it is your sole responsibility to remain available for order and fill

confirmations, and other communications regarding your Account until all open orders are completed.

Thereafter, you must monitor your Account frequently when you have open positions in the Account.



Your order shall be valid in accordance with the type and time of the given order, as specified. If the time

of validity or expiration date/time of the order is not specified, it shall be valid for an indefinite period.



Orders can be placed, and (if allowed) changed or removed within or outside the Trading Hours for each

type of CFD appearing on the Company’s Website and/or the Platform, as amended from the Company

from time to time.



Terms of Acceptance for Orders



It is your sole responsibility to clearly indicate the terms of an order when entered, whether it is a market

order, limit order, stop loss order or any other type of order, including the relevant price and lot size. You

acknowledge and agree that, despite our best efforts, the price at which execution occurs may be

materially different to the price specified in your order. This may result from sudden price movements in

the underlying assets that are beyond our control. The Company shall have no liability for failure to execute

orders. The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to reject any order in whole or in part

prior to execution, or to cancel any order, where your Account contains margin that is insufficient to

support the entire order or where such order is illegal or otherwise improper.

20



Execution Policy



We are required to have an execution policy and to provide our clients with appropriate information in

relation to our execution policy. Where you place orders with us, the execution factors that we consider

and their relative importance is as set out below:

a. Price. The relative importance we attach is “high”.

b. Speed. The relative importance we attach is “high”.

c. Likelihood of execution and settlement. The relative importance we attach is “high”.

d. Size. The relative importance we attach is “high”.

We are the principal to every order you place with us and therefore we are the only execution venue.



Authority



We shall be entitled to act for you upon instructions given or purporting to be given by you or any person

authorized on your behalf without further enquiry as to the genuineness, authority or identity of the person

giving or purporting to give such instructions provided such instruction is accompanied by your correct

Account number and password. If your Account is a joint account, you agree that we are authorized to act

on the instructions of any one person in whose name the Account is held, without further inquiry. We shall

have no responsibility for further inquiry into such apparent authority and no liability for the consequences

of any actions taken or failed to be taken by us in reliance on any such instructions or on the apparent

authority of any such persons.



Schedule

Right not to accept orders

We may, but shall not be obliged to, accept instructions to enter into a Transaction. If we decline to enter

into a proposed Transaction, we shall not be obliged to give a reason but we shall promptly notify you

accordingly.



Control of orders prior to execution



We have the right (but not the obligation) to set limits and/or parameters to control your ability to place

orders at our absolute discretion. Such limits and/or parameters may be amended, increased,

decreased, removed or added to by us at our absolute discretion and may include (without limitation):



a. controls over maximum order amounts and maximum order sizes;

b. controls over our total exposure to you;

21



c. controls over prices at which orders may be submitted (to include (without

limitation) controls over orders which are at a price which differs greatly from the market price at

the time the order is submitted to the order book);

d. controls over the Electronic Services (to include (without limitation)

any verification procedures to ensure that any particular order or orders has come from

you); and/or

e. any other limits, parameters or controls which we may be required to implement in accordance

with Applicable Regulations.



Trade Adjustments



Customers must be aware that Foreign exchange transactions carry a high degree of risk. The amount of

initial margin may be small relative to the value of the foreign currency so that transactions are ‘leveraged’

or ‘geared’ A relatively small market movement may have a proportionately larger impact on the funds

that the Customer has deposited or will have to deposit. This may work against as well as for the customer.



The Company exclusively reserves the right to widen its variable spreads, adjust leverage, change its

rollover rates and/or increase the margin requirements without notice under certain market conditions

Improper or Abusive Trading



The Company’s objective is to provide the most efficient trading liquidity available in the form of

streaming, tradable prices for most of the financial instruments we offer on the trading platform.

As a result of the highly automated nature of the delivery of these streaming, tradable prices, you

acknowledge and accept that price misquotations are likely to occur from time to time.

Should you execute trading strategies with the objective of exploiting such misquotation(s) or act in bad

faith (commonly known as ‘sniping’), the Company shall consider this as unacceptable behaviour. Should

the Company determine, at its sole discretion and in good faith, that you or any representative of yours

trading on your behalf is taking advantage, benefitting, attempting to take advantage or to benefit of such

misquotation(s) or that you are committing any other improper or abusive trading act such as for example:



a. fraud/illegal actions that led to the transaction;

b. orders placed based on manipulated prices as a result of system errors or system malfunctions;

c. arbitrage trading on prices offered by our platforms as a result of systems errors, manipulations or

exploitation of any temporal and/or minor inaccuracy in any rate or price offered on the Platform,

a combination of faster/slower feeds, abuse of the cancellation of trades feature available on the

Platform or use (without the prior and written consent of the Company) of any robots, spiders or

other automated data entry system with the Platform, the use of any software which applies

artificial intelligence analysis to the Company’s systems and/or Platform(s) and/or Client

Account;

d. coordinated transactions by related parties in order to take advantage of systems errors and

delays on systems updates;

e. trading actions and/or tactics that may lead to the exploitation of the Negative Balance

Protection measure

f. trading strategies aimed at exploiting errors in prices and/or concluding trades at off-market

prices and/or by taking advantage of internet delays

g. trading strategies that specializes in profiting of small price changes (commonly known as sniping

and/or scalping trading strategy)

h. trading actions and/or tactics that may lead to the exploitation of the Swap Free Account



Then the Company will have the right to:



a. adjust the price spreads available to you; and/or

23



b. restrict your access to streaming, instantly tradable quotes, including providing manual quotation

only; and/or

c. obtain from your account any historic trading profits that you have gained through such abuse of

e. immediately terminate our trading relationship

client of any brand of the Company (either directly or indirectly, alone or with partners, associates,

affiliates or any other third party) without the Company’s prior written approval. Should the Company

consider that the employee and/or former employee is trading with any brand of the Company without the

Company’s prior written approval personally and/or via a third party we shall consider all the trading to

via a third party we shall consider all the trading to be abusive and/or improper trading. In such

circumstances the relevant associate/former business associate’s trading account(s) and all open

positions shall be closed immediately and any funds held within the account shall be confiscated.

We have the right not to accept funds deposited by you and/or to cancel your deposits in the following

circumstances:

identification purposes or for any other reason;

b. if the Company suspects or has concerns that the submitted documents may be false or fake;

25



Performance and settlement



You will promptly deliver any instructions, money, or documents deliverable by you under a Transaction

in accordance with that Transaction as modified by any instructions given by us.



Position limits



We may require you to limit the number of open positions which you may have with us at any time and we

may in our sole discretion close out any one or more Transactions in order to ensure that such position

limits are maintained.



Withdrawals



Without prejudice and subject to the terms of this Agreement, all Applicable Regulations and all conditions

attaching to any relevant payments made to you under a bonus or rebate scheme operated by us, money

may be withdrawn by you from your Account provided that such money are not being utilized for margin

purposes or have otherwise become owing to us, once your withdrawal request is approved your

withdrawal request will be processed by us and sent to the same bank, credit card or other source for

execution as soon as possible. (Note: Some banks and credit card companies may take time to process

payments especially in currencies where a correspondent bank is involved in the transaction). The funds

will be returned to the bank account/credit card/other source from which the funds were debited.



If you have a Joint Account, payments from your Joint Account will require a withdrawal request form

which must be completed by all required Account holders and which must be submitted to us.



In case of a withdrawal request from your Account, where its execution is not possible without the closure

of certain open positions, the Company will be unable to execute such request. In this case, the Company

will require the closure of a number of positions by the Client, which will provide for sufficient ground for

the execution of the withdrawal request. The Company will not accept any withdrawal request where the

Client has open positions, and this execution will cause the Margin Level to drop below 200%.



If you have not met the necessary bonus trading requirements at the time you make a withdrawal request

the bonus will be debited from your trading account.



Withdrawals will only be made on request by you, by bank transfer to an account in your name or such

other method as we, in our absolute discretion, may determine.

26



If you have not met the necessary bonus trading requirements at the time you make a withdrawal request

the bonus will be debited from your trading account. Withdrawals will only be made on request by you, by

bank transfer to an account in your name or such other method as we, in our absolute discretion, may

determine.



Where the Company requires additional verification document(s) from the Client necessary to fulfil the

completion of the withdrawal, the Company reserves the right to reasonably decline the withdrawal

request of the Client upon a failure of the provision of the said documents within 5 (five) Business Days

from the day the document(s) was/were requested.



The Client agrees that any bank charges that might occur in case of a withdrawal request equal or less than

100 USD/EUR/GBP (or any other currency equivalent), derived from the Client’s trading account to the

client’s designated bank account, will be borne by the Client.



Corporate Actions

CFDs are subject to corporate actions including dividend adjustments. The Company may make dividend

adjustments in the Client Trading Account if a dividend is scheduled to be paid to the holders of the

underlying Assets of the CFDs. These adjustments are normally made on the ex-dividend date. Long

positions receive adjustments, whereas Short Positions are charged where applicable.

A mandatory corporate event is an event initiated by a public company which affects its share/equity.

Mandatory corporate events among others can be:

• Dividends: Part of corporate profits are allocated to shareholders. Dividends related to

stock positions are booked on pay date based on the eligible holding on the previous date,

the ex-date. Dividend payments will be credited with any applicable withholding taxes

deducted (applicable only for Long/Buy positions).

• Stock split / Reverse stock split: Increase / decrease in a corporation’s number of

outstanding equities and the subsequent equity price and nominal value are adjusted

accordingly. Such event will be affected on the ex-date.

• Bonus Shares: Additional stocks are allocated on ex-date based on the eligible holding on

the date prior the ex-date and will be available for trading, post value date upon receipt

from agent. Such events may be dealt with either by providing the additional stock(s) to

the client's account or by crediting the value of the said share to the client's account.

• Liquidation: Financial instruments of the company that is under the liquidation process,

held by the clients will be removed from client’s accounts. Liquidation proceeds, if any,

will be credited to client’s accounts upon receipt.

27



• Spin-off: The parent company’s shares lose value following a spinoff, due to the creation

of a new and independent company, through the distribution of new shares of the parent

company. Holders of the said financial instrument, receive equivalent shares of the new

company as compensation.

• Mergers: A merger happens when two companies combine to form a single entity. Public

companies often merge with the declared goal of increasing shareholder value, by gaining

market share or from entering new business segments. Relevant adjustments will be

reflected to the client’s accounts.



Special corporate events which are not included under this section which might be special and/or

infrequent will be handled by the Company in the best interest of clients to the extent that time and

operational process permits and at the Company’s discretion do not affect the Company’s financial

position and put it in danger.



In the case where an instrument offered by the company becomes subject to a corporate event, it may be

dealt with either by providing the additional financial instruments to the client's account or may result in

a cash adjustment, by crediting the value of the said financial instrument to the client's account. In any

case, the client’s account will reflect the adjusted value and/or the number of shares following the changes

that occurred.

For the cases where the relevant adjustments shall take place, but the pay date of the event is not

confirmed or beyond the tradeable cycle, or due to technical limitations, the Company will process these

adjustments manually and each client will be informed accordingly. Resultant adjustments will be

booked to clients’ account as soon as available/possible.

of any margin payment required under this clause.

15. NETTING



Rights on Default



On the occurrence of an Event of Default, we may exercise our rights under this clause, except that in the

case of the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in Clause 14.2 or Clause 14.3 of the definition of

Events of Default (each a “Bankruptcy Default”), the automatic termination provision of this clause shall

apply.



Liquidation Date



Subject to the following sub-clause, at any time following the occurrence of an Event of Default, we may,

by notice to you, specify a date (the “Liquidation Date”) for the termination and liquidation of Transactions

in accordance with this clause.



Automatic termination



The date of the occurrence of any Bankruptcy Default shall automatically constitute a Liquidation Date,

without the need for any notice by us and the provisions of the following sub-clause shall then apply.



Calculation of Liquidation Amount



Upon the occurrence of a Liquidation Date:



i. neither of us shall be obliged to make any further payments or deliveries under any

Transactions which would, but for this clause, have fallen due for performance on or after the

Liquidation Date and such obligations shall be satisfied by settlement (whether by payment,

set-off or otherwise) of the Liquidation Amount (as defined below);

ii. we shall (on, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the Liquidation Date) determine

(discounting if appropriate), in respect of each Transaction the total cost, loss or, as the case

may be, gain, in each case expressed in the Base Currency specified by us in writing or, failing

any such specification, the lawful currency of the United States (and, if appropriate, including

any loss of bargain, cost of funding or, without duplication, cost, loss or, as the case may be,

gain as a result of the termination, liquidation, obtaining, performing or re-establishing of any

hedge or related trading position) as a result of the termination, pursuant to this Agreement,

41



of each payment or delivery which would otherwise have been required to be made under such

Transaction (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent and having due

regard, if appropriate, to such market quotations published on, or official settlement prices set

by the relevant exchange as may be available on, or immediately preceding, the date of

calculation); and

iii. we shall treat each cost or loss to us, determined as above, as a positive amount and each gain

by us, so determined, as a negative amount and aggregate all such

amounts to produce a single, net positive or negative amount, denominated in the Base

Currency (the “Liquidation Amount”).



Payer



If the Liquidation Amount determined pursuant to this clause is a positive amount, you shall pay it to us

and if it is a negative amount, we shall pay it to you. We shall notify you of the Liquidation Amount, and by

whom it is payable, immediately after the calculation of such amount.



Other transactions



Where termination and liquidation occur in accordance with this clause, we shall also be entitled, at our

discretion, to terminate and liquidate, in accordance with the provisions of this clause, any other

transactions entered into between us which are then outstanding.



Payment



The Liquidation Amount shall be paid in the Base Currency by the close of business on the Business Day

following the completion of the termination and liquidation under this clause (converted as required by

applicable law into any other currency, any costs of such conversion to be borne by you, and (if applicable)

deducted from any payment to you). Any Liquidation Amount not paid on the due date shall be treated as

an unpaid such amount and bear interest, at the average rate at which overnight deposits in the currency

of such payment are offered by major banks in the London interbank market as of 11.00 am (London time)

(or, if no such rate is available, at such reasonable rate as we may select) plus one (1%) per annum for each

day for which such amount remains unpaid.



Base Currency

For the purposes of any calculation hereunder, we may convert amounts denominated in any other

currency into the Base Currency at such rate prevailing at the time of the calculation as we shall reasonably

select.

42



Payments



Unless a Liquidation Date has occurred or has been effectively set, we shall not be obliged to make any

payment or delivery scheduled to be made by us under a Transaction for as long as an Event of Default or

any event which may become (with the passage of time, the giving of notice, the making of any

determination hereunder, or any combination thereof) an Event of Default with respect to you has

occurred and is continuing.



Additional rights



Our rights under this clause shall be in addition to, and not in limitation or exclusion of, any other rights

which we may have (whether by agreement, operation of law or otherwise).



Application of netting to Transactions



This clause applies to each Transaction entered into or outstanding between us on or after the date this

Agreement takes effect.



Single agreement



This Agreement, the particular terms applicable to each Transaction entered into under this Agreement,

and all amendments to any of them shall together constitute a single agreement between us. We both

acknowledge that all Transactions entered into on or after the date this Agreement takes effect are entered

into in reliance upon the fact that the Agreement and all such terms constitute a single agreement between

us.



16. RIGHTS ON DEFAULT



Default



On an Event of Default or at any time after we have determined, in our absolute discretion, that you have

not performed (or we reasonably believe that you will not be able or willing in the future to perform) any

of your obligations to us, in addition to any rights under the Clause 15 (Netting) we shall be entitled,

without prior notice to you:

43



i. instead of returning investments to you equivalent to those credited to your account, to pay to

you the fair market value of such investments at the time we exercise such right;

ii. to sell such of your investments as are in our possession or in the possession of any nominee or

third party appointed under or pursuant to this Agreement, in each case as we may in our

absolute discretion select or and upon such terms as we may in our absolute discretion think fit

(without being responsible for any loss or diminution in price) in order to obtain funds sufficient

to cover any amount due by you hereunder;

iii. to close out, replace or reverse any Transaction, buy, sell, borrow or lend or enter into any other

Transaction or take, or refrain from taking, such other action at such time or times and in such

manner as, at our sole discretion, we consider necessary or appropriate to cover, reduce or

eliminate our loss or liability under or in respect of any of your contracts, positions or

commitments; and/or

iv. to cancel and/or consider void any Transactions and profits or losses achieved or unachieved

and/or to close out the account(s) you maintain with us pursuant to this Agreement, immediately

and without prior notice.



17. TERMINATION WITHOUT DEFAULT



Termination



Unless required by Applicable Regulations, either party may terminate this Agreement (and the

relationship between us) by giving Fifteen (15) days written notice of termination to the other. We may

terminate this Agreement immediately if you fail to observe or perform any provision of this Agreement or

in the event of your insolvency.



Upon terminating this Agreement:



i. all amounts payable by you to us will become immediately due and payable including (but

without limitation):



a. all outstanding fees, charges and commissions;

b. any dealing expenses incurred by terminating this Agreement; and

c. any losses and expenses realised in closing out any Transactions or settling or concluding

outstanding obligations incurred by us on your behalf.

44



ii. The Company shall apply best execution rules in cases where you have not provided The Company

with specific instructions regarding the closing of your positions.



The Company shall return any funds remaining in your trading account to your bank account, specifically

the account from which the funds were debited. Your funds may be returned to another bank account to

which you are the beneficiary as long as you provide us with the required documents to verify that the

account belongs to you.



Existing rights



Termination shall not affect then outstanding rights and obligations and Transactions which shall

continue to be governed by this Agreement and the particular clauses agreed between us in relation to

such Transactions until all obligations have been fully performed.



18. EXCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS AND INDEMNITY



General Exclusion



Neither we nor our directors, officers, employees, or agents shall be liable for any losses, damages, costs

or expenses, whether arising out of negligence, breach of contract, misrepresentation or otherwise,

incurred or suffered by you under this Agreement (including any Transaction or where we have declined

to enter into a proposed Transaction) unless such loss is a reasonably foreseeable consequence or arises

directly from our or their respective gross negligence, wilful default or fraud. In no circumstance, shall we

have liability for losses suffered by you or any third party for any special or consequential damage, loss of

profits, loss of goodwill or loss of business opportunity arising under or in connection with this Agreement,

whether arising out of negligence, breach of contract, misrepresentation or otherwise. Nothing in this

Agreement will limit our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence.



Tax implications

Without limitation, we do not accept liability for any adverse tax implications of any Transaction

whatsoever.

45



Changes in the market



In regards to Foreign exchange trading, market orders are executed at the bid/ask prices offered through

us. Pending orders (stop loss, limit (take profit), entry limit (to buy or to sell), entry stop (to buy or to sell)

are executed at the then market price requested by you and offered through us.

We reserve the right, at our full discretion, not to execute the order, or to change the quoted price of the

Transaction, or to offer you a new quote, in case of technical failure of the trading platform or in case of

extraordinary or abnormal fluctuations of the price of the financial instrument as offered in the market. In

the event we offer you a new quote you have the right to either accept it or refuse it and thus cancel the

execution of the Transaction.



Without limitation, we do not accept any liability by reason of any delay or change in market conditions

before any particular Transaction is in effect.



Limitation of Liability



We shall not be liable to you for any partial or non-performance of our obligations hereunder by reason of

any cause beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation any breakdown, delay, malfunction

or failure of transmission, communication or computer facilities, industrial action, act of terrorism, act of

God, acts and regulations of any governmental or supra national bodies or authorities or the failure by the

relevant intermediate broker or agent, agent or principal of our custodian, sub-custodian, dealer,

exchange, clearing house or regulatory or self-regulatory organisation, for any reason, to perform its

obligations. Nothing in this Agreement will exclude or restrict any duty or liability we may have to you

under Applicable Regulations, which may not be excluded or restricted thereunder.



Responsibility for orders



You will be responsible for all orders entered on your behalf via an Electronic Service and you will be fully

liable to us for the settlement of any Transaction arising from it.



Entire Agreement



You acknowledge that you have not relied on or been induced to enter into this Agreement by a

representation other than those expressly set out in this Agreement. We will not be liable to you (in equity,

contract or tort) for a representation that is not set out in this Agreement and that is not fraudulent.

46



Indemnity



You shall pay to us such sums as we may from time to time require in or towards satisfaction of any debit

balance on any of your accounts with us and, on a full indemnity basis, any losses, liabilities, costs or

expenses (including legal fees), taxes, imposts and levies which we may incur or be subjected to with

respect to any of your accounts or any Transaction or as a result of any misrepresentation by you or any

violation by you of your obligations under this Agreement (including any Transaction) or by the

enforcement of our rights.



19. MISCELLANEOUS

Agreement, we will give at least ten business days’ written notice to you.

this Agreement (including any Transaction) or otherwise shall operate as a waiver of those or any other

rights or remedies. No single or partial exercise of a right or remedy shall prevent further exercise of that

right or remedy or the exercise of another right or remedy.



Set-off



Without prejudice to any other rights to which we may be entitled, we may at any time and without notice

to you set off any amount (whether actual or contingent, present or future) owed by you to us against any

ascribe a commercially reasonable value to any amount which is contingent or which for any other reason

is unascertained.

49

Risk Disclosure



1. The risk of loss arising from Foreign Exchange Contracts and over-the-counter Contracts for

Differences can be substantial. You should carefully consider whether such investments are

suitable for you in the light of your circumstances and financial resources.

2. If the market moves against your position, you may, in a relatively short time, sustain a total loss

of the funds placed by way of margin or deposit. You may be required to deposit a substantial

additional sum, at short notice, to maintain your margin balances. If you do not maintain your

margin balances your position may be closed out at a loss and you will be liable for any resulting

deficit. All positions carry margin requirements between 2% and 5.

3. Under certain market conditions it may be difficult or impossible to close out a position. This may

occur, for example, where trading is suspended or restricted at times of rapid price movement.

4. Where permitted, placing a stop-loss order will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended

amounts, for market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders at the stipulated

price.

5. Foreign Exchange Contracts and over-the-counter Contracts for Differences can be highly volatile

and investments in them carry a substantial risk of loss. The high degree of “gearing” or “leverage”

which is often obtainable in trading these contracts stems from the payment of what is a

comparatively modest deposit or margin when compared with the overall contract value. As a

result, a relatively small market movement can, in addition to achieving substantial gains, where

the market moves in your favour, result in substantial losses which may exceed your original

investment where there is an equally small movement against you.

6. This brief statement cannot disclose all risks of investments in Foreign Exchange Contracts and

Contracts for Differences. They are not suitable for many members of the public and you should

carefully study such investments before you commit funds to them.

7. Investing in FX Contracts and CFDs with an underlying asset listed in a currency other than your

base currency entails a currency risk, due to the fact that when the CFD or FX Contract is settled in

53



a currency other than your base currency, the value of your return may be affected by its

conversion into the base currency.

8. You should also be aware that they are using the website and its services at your own risk. Without

limiting the foregoing, the Services are suitable only for customers who are able to bear the loss of

all the money they invest, and who understand the risks and have experience in taking risks

involved in financial markets. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of

your investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You

should be aware of all the risks associated with digital options trading (including, but not limited

to, risks stemming from market conditions, the rules of certain markets), and seek advice from an

independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. You hereby acknowledge that you will bear

sole responsibility for any losses caused through the use of the Site and\or the Services.



Insurance



Before you enter into a contract of general insurance with an insurer, you have a duty at law, Insurance

Law to disclose to the insurer every matter that you know, or could reasonably expect to know is relevant

to the insurer's decision whether to accept the risk of the insurance and, if so, on what terms. You have the

same duty to disclose those matters to the insurer before you renew, extend, vary or reinstate a contract

of General Insurance.
