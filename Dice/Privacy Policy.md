A. The information we gather
----------------------------

Personal Information You Provide Us

In certain areas of the Sites, such as those in which you complete a profile, submit your resume, create a new account, or enter Dice-sponsored contests or promotions, we may request that you provide us with certain personal information, such as your e-mail address, first and last name, postal zip code, phone number, profession, work experience, social media information, photographs, ethnicity, gender, veteran status, citizenship and/or work eligibility. We may, in such situations, seek to identify which informational items are required and which are optional. We may also collect any other information you submit when you contact us, including other information you submit when you contact us; this includes any information you provide in a submission through our Contact Support form, chat functions, or other contact methods.

Personal Information We Passively Collect

When visitors use the Services, we passively collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which links were "clicked". Collecting such information involves the collection and logging of IP addresses, MAC address, operating system, device type, mobile ad identifiers, browsing history, search history and information regarding an individual’s interaction with an internet website, application or advertisement, Internet Service Provider (ISP) and browser software used by each user of the Services. In some instances, we may collect geo-location based information for the purpose of helping identify jobs in your area.

The information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of the Sites and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have viewed and/or clicked their advertisements.

Mobile Applications

On mobile applications, we use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Services on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregate usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.

On mobile applications, we may send push notifications to your device. You may opt-out of these at the device level.

You may opt out of location-based services by editing the setting at the device level.

Searchable Profiles

In the past, job seekers may have elected to make their profile searchable by our customers on a confidential basis only. Dice no longer offers this feature for job seekers, but for those job seekers who had previously registered on this basis, the user's name and contact information will not be displayed to customers performing searches on the Sites. If the customer desires to contact the confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, they will send an email to the job seeker through our system. We will forward the email to the seeker's email address. The seeker's email address will not be provided directly to the customer. When posting a resume confidentially, it is the job seeker's responsibility to ensure that their contact information is not included within their resume attachment.

Children and Minors

Dice Services are not available to children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age.

California Residents: Personal Information Categories Collected and Sources of that Information

The information we collect, and may have collected in the last twelve (12) months, would include the following categories of personal information under the CCPA:

1. Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)), such as name, address, telephone number, education, employment, and employment history (some personal information included in this category may overlap with other categories)
2. Identifiers such as your real name, alias, postal address, zip code, telephone number, email address, account name, or other similar identifiers
3. Education information
4. Unique and online identifiers such as device identifiers, internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers, beacon identifiers, pixel tags or mobile ad identifiers or similar technology, or other forms of persistent or probabilistic identifiers that can be used to identify a particular consumer or device
5. Commercial information that identifies or could reasonably be linked to you, such as products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies
6. Internet or other electronic network activity information that identifies or could reasonably be linked to you, such as browsing history, search history and information regarding an individual’s interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement
7. Professional or employment-related information, such as current or past job history or performance evaluations
8. Location information, such as your precise geolocation while you access our sites or apps if you have enabled location services on your device
9. Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law, which may include age if 40 years or older, race, color, citizenship, religion or creed, marital status, medical condition, physical or mental disability, sex (including gender, pregnancy or childbirth and related medical conditions), veteran or military status, genetic information (including familial genetic information)
10. Inferences drawn from personal information, such as person's preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, or aptitudes.

Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia: Collection of Personal Information Defined as Sensitive Under Applicable Law Collection

Some of the information we collect may be defined as sensitive under Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia privacy laws. Such information includes precise geolocation information and racial or ethnic origin.

Profile Supplementation

To provide services to our customers, Dice may collect indexed content, including information about you, from a variety of publicly available websites. Indexed content may include personal information such as posts on blogs. In general, such indexed content is available through standard search engines or by visiting the public websites themselves. We combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. Dice may append this information to your profile or use this content to create a profile, whether or not an individual has an account with us. If you would like to remove the information we collect, contact us at [support@dice.com](mailto:support@dice.com?subject=Support). Dice has no ownership rights to the indexed content sourced from third-party sites and cannot guarantee that we will not collect information from a publicly available source later.

Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include job and industry information, such as skills, title, experience, qualifications, etc. and any other publicly available information such as social profiles.

Other Users

Please note that we cannot control the acts of users of the Services. All members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personal information in a resume or profile or other medium, the information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited email from other parties outside Dice. In the event that you encounter any Dice user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact [privacy@dice.com](mailto:privacy@dice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy).

B. How we use the information we gather
---------------------------------------

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the information we gather. Dice encourages all third parties involved, including its advertisers, to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and users and to handle personal information responsibly. Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association with, Dice who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please contact [privacy@dice.com](mailto:privacy@dice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy).

How we use passively collected information

We use information collected passively, as identified above, in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and users, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Services. We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, users, and other current and potential business partners. We may also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked through links to their sites.

How we use personal information

We may use the personal information a user submits for the following purposes:

1. To understand a user's needs and create content that is relevant to the user;
2. To generate statistical studies;
3. To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys;
4. To notify user referrals of Dice services, information, or products when a user requests that Dice send such information to referrals;
5. To improve services, information, and products;
6. To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support to users and to recipients of Dice products;
7. To communicate with the user, including responding to requests and other communications such as those you submit through our Contact Us form or chat functions, and with recipients of Dice products and services;
8. To email users about services, information, products and offers from our business partners (and as set forth in section C, How we share information we gather);
9. To personalize the Sites for the user;
10. To notify the user of any changes with the Sites which may affect the user;
11. To enforce terms of use on the Sites;
12. To allow the user to purchase products, access services, or otherwise engage in activities the user selects;
13. To allow us to contact you by phone, email and/or social media. In some cases, this includes text messaging or alerts and carrier charges may apply;
14. To provide, support, personalize, and develop our Site, applications, and product or service offerings;
15. To create, maintain, customize, service, and secure your account with us;
16. To audit our interactions with you, such as counting impressions or verifying the quality and effectiveness of content including ads;
17. To prevent malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and participating in any prosecution or enforcement of laws or agreements meant to prevent or punish such activity;
18. To maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our Site, applications, products and services, databases and other technology assets, and our business, including the detection of security incidents;
19. To debug, identify, or repair errors or effectuate similar functional enhancements;
20. To develop, improve, and deliver marketing and advertising;
21. For internal uses such as research, business analytics, development, audits, account management and security;
22. For legal and operational compliance purposes, such as monitoring whether our operations are effectively implementing this policy;
23. To engage in or enable internal uses consisted with our relationship with you, or compatible with the context in which you provided the information, such as internal research for technology development; and
24.  For any other purpose described to you when collecting your personal information before or at the time of collection.

Blogs, Forums, and Survey Results

Usernames, identifications ("IDs"), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on the Sites when a user voluntarily and publicly discloses personal information, such as when a user uses features to send a message to another user, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly-released software application. Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from these pages, contact us at [privacy@dice.com](mailto:privacy@dice.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey. Circumstances under which Dice would publicly disclose information collected from surveys include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the Sites' users, providing data to Dice advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications. Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where Dice advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Dice reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no personal information identifying a specific user is disclosed. Participation in surveys is at a user's option; Dice does not conduct mandatory surveys.

We process personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

C. How we share information we gather
-------------------------------------

Sharing with Service Providers

Subject to the foregoing, Dice uses your personal information in several ways. Dice may share your personal information with service providers to help us with our business activities such as processing credit cards, email and social network marketing, offering customer service, or operating a community forum. If you communicate with us through a chat function on the Site, we may disclose the information submitted through or otherwise collected by the chat function to third party service providers that provide or support our chat function tools and services. These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

Sharing with Our Customers

Regarding job applications, Dice will not disclose your profile or resume on our Sites to prospective employers without your consent unless you instruct us otherwise.

Job seekers should post profiles and resumes on our Sites only if they wish such information to be viewed by our customers. At any time, job seekers may elect that their profile and resume not be searchable by our customers by logging into their account and changing the status of their profile or, if that is not possible, they may contact us at [support@dice.com](mailto:support@dice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy) and we will make the change for them.

Sharing with Third Parties and Marketing Preferences

If you "opt in" to receive promotional materials from third parties, information you have made available to us may be made available to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you. You may "opt out" of receiving such materials at any time in a variety of ways: by using the "opt-out" link included in each email, by changing your subscriptions preferences on the "user settings" page in your Dice account or by contacting us at [privacy@dice.com](mailto:privacy@dice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy). If you have provided more than one email address to our service, you may continue to be contacted, unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided. If you opted in to receive information directly from third parties, then you must contact those third parties directly to opt-out.

In order to effectively tailor our services, these Sites may share your personal information to third party consultants and business partners, including, but not limited to other lead generation companies (collectively "Third Party Contractors") to collect, compile, organize, and market to you related services. By submitting any personal information on this Site you consent and Authorize Dice to share with Third Party Contractors the personal information  necessary to enable additional service offerings. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at [privacy@dice.com](mailto:privacy@dice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy).

Sharing for Other Purposes

Dice reserves the right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any Site visitor or user as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, court order, government agency or law enforcement requestor other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, investigate fraud, protect your safety or the safety of others, or other like circumstance. We also may disclose such information to third parties: (i) in connection with prevention of fraud, deception, or other malicious activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that may involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or Services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your use of the Services in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity or if you are in violation of our Terms of Use Agreement or other published guidelines.

If Dice is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. Dice reserves the right to assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party your personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of any portion or all of Dice's or its affiliated entities' assets or stock.

We may disclose personal information to third parties to whom you or your authorized representatives direct us to disclose your personal information.  We may disclose personal information to other parties identified by you when collecting your personal information before or at the time of collection, or to which you separately consented.

Framing and Co-Branding

The Sites may utilize framing and masking techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the Site when the user is actually on a third-party website. We also have co-branding relationships with certain partners. In these relationships, you will notice our service platform on our partner's page. In this situation, both parties are collecting your data and both privacy policies govern the data collected. We will not share your data with third parties without your consent in these and other relationships. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Sites and to read the privacy policies of every website that collects personal information.

D. Tracking Technologies
------------------------

Technologies such as cookies, beacons (including pixels), and javascripts are used by Dice and our partners, analytics, and service providers. These technologies are used generally for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and gathering demographic information about our user base.  

Some Internet browsers have a “do-not-track” feature that let you tell the Site that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, the Site does not respond to browser “do-not-track” signals. We allow third parties to use the Site to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites, applications, and other online products or services.

Cookies

We use cookies on the Sites. A "browser" or "HTTP" cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user's browsing program. Dice may use browser cookies to personalize a user's pages at our Sites, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for fraud prevention, or to track visits to our Sites. If a user does not want Dice or its partners to deploy browser cookies in the user's browser when the user visits the Sites, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program. Rejecting cookies may affect a user's ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on our Sites.  To adjust your cookies preferences, please click [here](https://www.dice.com/about/privacy-policy/#cmpscreencustom).

Pixels

We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These pixels are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Sites. The information that we collect and share does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/](https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/) or you may also opt out by clicking [here](https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/).

Web Beacons

From time to time we use web beacons. A web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed. Web beacons enable Dice to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits a Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to each Site. For example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image. Web beacons are not placed on a user's computer.

Log files

Dice web servers may automatically log aggregate information, such as a user's IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data.

Advertisements

The ads appearing on the Sites may be delivered to visitors by third parties, such as Google. The third-party advertising technology that Dice uses on the Sites uses information derived from a user's visits to the Sites to target advertising within the Sites. In addition, Dice's advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target advertising on the Sites. In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, our partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user's browser. Information about users' visits to the Sites, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad (but not users' names, addresses, or other personal information), are used to serve ads to visitors. The use of cookies enables our partners to serve ads to users based on such user's visit to the Sites and other sites on the Internet. As with other cookies, and consistent with Dice's policy on cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the user's drive or memory. For more information about Google, Google's use of cookies, and how to "opt out" of Google's email/information lists, please click here: [http://www.google.com/privacy\_ads.html](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

Advertising Choices

We partner with a third-party to display advertising on our Sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you would prefer to not receive personalized ads based on your browser or device usage, you may generally express your opt-out preference to no longer receive tailored advertisements. Please note that you will continue to see advertisements, but they will no longer be tailored to your interests.

To opt-out of interest-based advertising by participating companies in the following consumer choice mechanisms, please visit:

1. Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)'s self-regulatory opt-out page ([optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/)) and mobile application-based "AppChoices" download page ([https://youradchoices.com/appchoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices))
2. Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)'s self-regulatory opt-out page ([optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/)).

Links to third party web sites

Links to third party web sites or widgets to enable sharing of information through social networks on the Sites are provided solely as a convenience to the user. When a user uses these links, the user leaves the Sites. Dice has not reviewed these third-party sites, does not control, and is not responsible for, any of them, their content or privacy practices. Dice does not endorse or make any representations about the third-party sites, or any information, services, or products found on the sites. If a user decides to access any of the linked sites, Dice encourages the user to read their privacy statements. The user accesses such sites at user's own risk.

E. Security
-----------

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please help keep your account safe by using a strong password.

If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can contact us at [security@dice.com](mailto:security@dice.com?subject=Security).

F. Surveys and Sweepstakes
--------------------------

Occasionally, Dice may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content and to better understand your needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey information with any third-party, except in aggregate form.

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). The sweepstakes rules, to the extent it conflicts with this policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes - please remember to read it carefully. We may use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor the use of the Sites, to personalize the Sites, to send participants an email, and to measure participants' demographics, interests and opinions. We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users' personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

Referrals

If you choose to use our referral service to tell another person about a job, we will ask you for that person's email address. We will automatically send that person a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and do not store these email addresses.

G. Social Media Features

Colorado Residents: Additional Privacy Rights Information

If you are a Colorado resident, you may authorize another person, acting on your behalf, to opt out of exchanges of your personal information for money or other valuable consideration, including through opt-out preference signals.
