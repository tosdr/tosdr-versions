A. The information we gather
----------------------------

Personal Information You Provide Us

_Contact Information and Demographics_

In certain areas of the Sites, such as those in which you complete a profile, submit your resume, create a new account, or enter Dice-sponsored contests or promotions, we may request that you provide us with certain personal information, such as your e-mail address, first and last name, postal zip code, phone number, profession, work experience, social media information, photographs, race and ethnicity, gender, veteran status, citizenship, citizenship status, and/or work eligibility. We may, in such situations, seek to identify which informational items are required and which are optional.

_Education, Professional, and Employment-Related Information_

If you choose to register for job opportunities or apply for a job posted by our customers, we ask for information about your education, employment information and history, job skills, qualifications, titles, and other work-related information that may be relevant to the profile you are creating or the job applications you submit. You also may have the opportunity to submit a resume, curriculum vitae, or other documents you select as relevant to your profile or application.

_Other Information You Submit_

We may also collect any other information you submit when you contact us: this includes any information you provide in a submission through our surveys, Contact Support form, chat functions, or other contact methods.

Personal Information We Passively Collect: Device and System Information

When visitors use the Services, we passively collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which links were "clicked". Collecting such information involves the collection and logging of IP addresses, MAC address, operating system, device type, mobile ad identifiers, browsing history, search history and information regarding an individual’s interaction with an internet website, application or advertisement, Internet Service Provider (ISP) and browser software used by each user of the Services. In some instances, we may collect geo-location based information for the purpose of helping identify jobs in your area.

The information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of the Sites and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have viewed and/or clicked their advertisements.

On mobile applications, we use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Services on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregate usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.

On mobile applications, we may send push notifications to your device. You may opt-out of these at the device level.

You may opt out of location-based services by editing the setting at the device level.

Searchable Profiles

In the past, job seekers may have elected to make their profile searchable by our customers on a confidential basis only. Dice no longer offers this feature for job seekers, but for those job seekers who had previously registered on this basis, the user's name and contact information will not be displayed to customers performing searches on the Sites. If the customer desires to contact the confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, they will send an email to the job seeker through our system. We will forward the email to the seeker's email address. The seeker's email address will not be provided directly to the customer. When posting a resume confidentially, it is the job seeker's responsibility to ensure that their contact information is not included within their resume attachment.

Children and Minors

Dice Services are not available to children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age.

California Residents: Personal Information Categories Collected and Sources of that Information

The information we collect, and may have collected in the last twelve (12) months, would include the following categories of personal information under the CCPA:

2. Identifiers such as your real name, alias, postal address, zip code, telephone number, email address, account name, or other similar identifiers
3. Education information
4. Unique and online identifiers such as device identifiers, internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers, beacon identifiers, pixel tags or mobile ad identifiers or similar technology, or other forms of persistent or probabilistic identifiers that can be used to identify a particular consumer or device
5. For representatives or employees of our customers, commercial information that identifies or could reasonably be linked to your organization or you acting on behalf of your organization, such as products or services purchased, obtained, or considered by your organization or you acting on behalf of your organization, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies by your organization or you acting on behalf of your organization
6. Internet or other electronic network activity information that identifies or could reasonably be linked to you, such as browsing history, search history and information regarding an individual’s interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement

8. Location information, such as your precise geolocation while you access our sites or apps if you have enabled location services on your device

Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Texas, Oregon and Virginia: Collection of Personal Information Defined as Sensitive Under Applicable Law Collection

Some of the information we collect may be defined as sensitive under Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Texas, Oregon and Virginia privacy laws. Such information may include, depending on the state in which you reside, precise geolocation information, racial or ethnic origin, and/or citizenship, citizenship status, or immigration status.

Information That Is Publicly Available, Indexed by Search Engines, or Purchased from Third Parties

To provide services to our customers, Dice may collect indexed content, including information about you, from a variety of publicly available websites or search engines. Indexed content may include personal information from sources such as posts on blogs, posts on social media sites, information within social media profiles, and online community platforms. The personal information included in indexed content may consist of contact information and demographics, education, professional, and employment-related information, and other personal information about you on publicly available websites. In general, such indexed content is available through standard search engines or by visiting the public websites themselves. We combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. Dice may append this information to your profile or use this content to create a profile, whether or not an individual has an account with us. If you would like to remove the information we collect, contact us at [support@dice.com](mailto:support@dice.com?subject=Support). Dice has no ownership rights to the indexed content sourced from third-party sites and cannot guarantee that we will not collect information from a publicly available source later.

Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include job and industry information, such as skills, title, experience, qualifications, etc. and any other publicly available information such as social profiles.

Other Users

Please note that we cannot control the acts of users of the Services. All members and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personal information in a resume or profile or other medium, the information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited email from other parties outside Dice. In the event that you encounter any Dice user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact [privacy@dice.com](mailto:privacy@dice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy).

B. How we use the information we gather

Blogs, Forums, and Survey Results

Usernames, identifications ("IDs"), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on the Sites when a user voluntarily and publicly discloses personal information, such as when a user uses features to send a message to another user, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly-released software application. Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from these pages, contact us at [privacy@dice.com](mailto:privacy@dice.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

Circumstances under which Dice would publicly disclose information collected from surveys include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the Sites' users, providing data to Dice advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications. Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where Dice advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Dice reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no personal information identifying a specific user is disclosed. Participation in surveys is at a user's option; Dice does not conduct mandatory surveys.

Regarding job applications, Dice will not disclose your profile or resume on our Sites to prospective employers without your consent unless you instruct us otherwise.

Job seekers should post profiles and resumes on our Sites only if they wish such information to be viewed by our customers. At any time, job seekers may elect that their profile and resume not be searchable by our customers by logging into their account and changing the status of their profile or, if that is not possible, they may contact us at [support@dice.com](mailto:support@dice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy) and we will make the change for them.

Sharing for Compliance and Legal Purposes

Dice reserves the right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any Site visitor or user as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, court order, government agency or law enforcement requestor other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, investigate fraud, protect your safety or the safety of others, or other like circumstance. We also may disclose such information to third parties: (i) in connection with prevention of fraud, deception, or other malicious activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that may involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law.

The categories of personal information we might share in these circumstances includes contact information, demographics, education information, professional information, employment-related information, device or system information, and information that is publicly available, indexed by search engines, or purchased from third parties. We would limit the disclosure to the type of data reasonably necessary to address the request or legal purpose of the disclosure.

We would disclose any type of personal information you directed us to share at that time.

Framing and Co-Branding

The Sites may utilize framing and masking techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the Site when the user is actually on a third-party website. We also have co-branding relationships with certain partners. In these relationships, you will notice our service platform on our partner's page. In this situation, both parties are collecting your data and both privacy policies govern the data collected. We will not share your data with third parties without your consent in these relationships. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Sites and to read the privacy policies of every website that collects personal information.

D. Tracking Technologies
------------------------

Technologies such as cookies, beacons (including pixels), and javascripts are used by Dice and our partners, analytics, and service providers. These technologies are used generally for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and gathering demographic information about our user base.  

Some Internet browsers have a “do-not-track” feature that let you tell the Site that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, the Site does not respond to browser “do-not-track” signals. We allow third parties to use the Site to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites, applications, and other online products or services.

Cookies

We and our partners use cookies on the Sites. A "browser" or "HTTP" cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user's browsing program. Dice may use browser cookies to personalize a user's pages at our Sites, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for fraud prevention, advertising, or to track visits to our Sites. If a user does not want Dice or its partners to deploy browser cookies in the user's browser when the user visits the Sites, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program. Rejecting cookies may affect a user's ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on our Sites.  To adjust your cookies preferences, please click [here](https://www.dice.com/about/privacy-policy/#cmpscreencustom).

Pixels

We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These pixels are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Sites. The information that we collect and share does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/](https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/) or you may also opt out by clicking [here](https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/).

Web Beacons

From time to time we use web beacons. A web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed. Web beacons enable Dice to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits a Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to each Site. For example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image. Web beacons are not placed on a user's computer.

Log files

Dice web servers may automatically log aggregate information, such as a user's IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data.

Advertisements

Any ads appearing on the Sites may be delivered to visitors by third parties, such as Google. For more information about Google’s advertising delivery, please click here: [http://www.google.com/privacy\_ads.html](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

You can communicate to advertising delivery providers that participate in the following consumer choice mechanisms by visiting:

1. Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)'s self-regulatory opt-out page ([optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/)) and mobile application-based "AppChoices" download page (https://youradchoices.com/appchoices)
2. Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)'s self-regulatory opt-out page ([optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/)).

Links to third party web sites

Links to third party web sites or widgets to enable sharing of information through social networks on the Sites are provided solely as a convenience to the user. When a user uses these links, the user leaves the Sites. Dice has not reviewed these third-party sites, does not control, and is not responsible for, any of them, their content or privacy practices. Dice does not endorse or make any representations about the third-party sites, or any information, services, or products found on the sites. If a user decides to access any of the linked sites, Dice encourages the user to read their privacy statements. The user accesses such sites at user's own risk.

E. Security
-----------

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

F. Surveys and Sweepstakes
--------------------------

Occasionally, Dice may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content and to better understand your needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey information with any third-party, except in aggregate form.

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). The sweepstakes rules, to the extent it conflicts with this policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes - please remember to read it carefully. We may use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor the use of the Sites, to personalize the Sites, to send participants an email, and to measure participants' demographics, interests and opinions. We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users' personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

Referrals

If you choose to use our referral service to tell another person about a job, we will ask you for that person's email address. We will automatically send that person a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and do not store these email addresses.

G. Social Media Features
------------------------

The Sites include social media features, such as social media link outs and widgets that run on our Sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

H. Data Subject Rights and Correction of Personal Information
-------------------------------------------------------------

At any time, you can request from Dice information about which personal data Dice processes about you and the correction or deletion of such personal data. If your information changes, or if you no longer desire our services, you may correct, update, amend, and delete/remove your personal information or deactivate your account by making the change on your account page, by emailing our Customer Support at [support@dice.com](mailto:support@dice.com?subject=Support) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

Depending on which laws apply to your personal information, we may only be able to do some of these actions for you.

Please note that if you request that Dice delete your personal data, you will no longer be able to use any Dice service that requires the use of your personal data. If you have provided more than one email address to our service, you may continue to be contacted, unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.

If Dice uses your personal data based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you may further request from Dice a copy of the personal data that you have provided to Dice. For all individuals located outside of California, please contact [privacy@dice.com](mailto:privacy@dice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy) and specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates, the format in which you would like this information, and whether the personal data is to be sent to you or another recipient.

Please direct any such request to [privacy@dice.com](mailto:privacy@dice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy).
