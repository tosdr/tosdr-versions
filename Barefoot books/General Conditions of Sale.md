Shipping & Returns

**Shipping** (US and Canada)
============================

When you order through [www.barefootbooks.com](https://www.barefootbooks.com/), shipping rates are based on the service level you select and net cart total after discounts and credits. We accept one order per address. If you need to deliver to multiple addresses, you will need to place a separate order for each address.

Barefoot Books ships to addresses in most parts of North America. This includes all Canadian provinces and all contiguous US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii, Puerto Rico and APO/FPO addresses). 

Due to weight restrictions, some orders may be shipped in multiple parcels. We highly recommend checking each shipment as it arrives to ensure that all items ordered are included.

For US shipments: Packages under 15 lbs may be delivered through [UPS Mail Innovations](http://www.upsmailinnovations.com/support/frequentlyaskedquestions.html), a partnership between UPS and the US Postal Service. We are unable to ship to PO Boxes/APO/FPO via Standard or Expedited shipping methods.
