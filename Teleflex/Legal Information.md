### 2\. Purpose and Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Data

Certain laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), require that we inform you of the legal bases for our processing of your personal information. Pursuant to the GDPR (and other similar laws), we process personal information for the following legal bases:

| PURPOSE FOR PROCESSING | LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING |
| --- | --- |
| * Improving the content, functionality and operation of our Sites and the goods and services we offer.<br>* Ensuring the Sites are presented in the most effective manner for you and your device.<br>* Compiling statistical data on the use of our Sites.<br>* Allowing you to participate in interactive features of our Sites, when you choose to do so. | This use of your Personal Data is necessary for our legitimate business interest in monitoring the utilization of our Sites and to improve its quality.

| * To send you information about our latest products, promotions and events.<br>* To provide educational events and learning materials | This use of your Personal Data is necessary for the legitimate business interest we have in promoting our business, services and products.

| * To comply with requirements of regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (**FDA**), the European Medicines Agency (**EMA**) and Medical Technology Associations, if necessary. | The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Teleflex is subject, or necessary for our legitimate business interest in complying with regulatory requirements which are not relevant legal obligations for the purposes of data protection laws. |

### 3\. Cookies and Other Technologies

When browsing the Sites, our servers collect certain information, such as your IP address, domain name, browser type, pages viewed and the time you visited our Sites, the number of times you return to our Sites and other click-stream data. This information may be compiled and/or analyzed by us on an aggregated basis to measure our users’ habits. This helps us to measure the use of our Sites, improve the content, functionality and operation of our Sites and to better understand and serve our users.

Cookies are small data files that are created by your computer’s browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a particular website. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to otherwise specifically tailor your experience on our Sites.

Depending on your location, we may ask for your consent to our use of any non-necessary cookies (see descriptions of cookie types below) by way of a pop-up banner when you first land on our website. You can choose to either accept or reject non-necessary cookies as you prefer.

Otherwise, you can also set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and decide if you want to accept it or not. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but they can be set up to ask for your prior consent before an individual cookie is set on your device. This will give you control over your cookies; however, it may interfere with your browsing experience as some websites may not function properly and you may not be able to take advantage of all the features offered by our Sites. If cookies are blocked, certain tasks or features of our Sites may not be functional.

For instructions on blocking and deleting cookies, see the privacy and help documentation of your specific browser’s website. If you use multiple devices and/or browsers, you will need to disable cookies on each device and on each browser separately.

If you limit the ability of our Sites to set cookies, this may prevent you from using certain features of our Sites properly and your user experience – which will no longer be personalized for you – may deteriorate. You may also be able to opt-out from certain cookies through third party cookie management sites. Disabling cookies may prevent you from using certain parts of our Site.

Session cookies are used to store temporary data in memory which exists only for the duration of the user’s session. All information from them is removed completely whenever the session is finished. They are generally used to pass information from one Site to another. Teleflex uses session cookies to maintain an internal session identifier required by the underlying web technology, and to provide Site usage statistics.

Please note that we use the following types of cookies:

| **TYPE (WHAT APPLICATION USES THE COOKIE)** |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Necessary cookies** | These are essential in order to enable you to move around the Sites and use features, such as accessing secure areas of the Sites. Without these cookies, our Sites would not work properly and services cannot be provided. Therefore, you cannot reject these cookies. |
| **Performance cookies** | These collect information about how visitors use the Sites, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our Sites and we also use them to help us monitor how our visitors reach our Sites. |
| **Functional cookies** | These allow the Sites to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. |
| **Advertising Cookies** | These allow information gathered about your visits over time and across different websites or applications in order to help predict your preferences and show you ads that are more likely to be of interest to you. |

Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions below.

We may use third party services such as Google Analytics to evaluate usage of our Site and our services. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Site and services. We use these tools to help us improve our Site’s and services’ performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services in accordance with their own privacy policies. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy. You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

Cross Device and Browser Use. We and our third party service providers may use the information that we collect about you (whether directly from you from our website, through your device(s), or from a third party) to help us and our third party service providers identify other devices that you use (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer). We, and our third party service providers, also may use the cross-device and browser tracking and other information we learn about you to serve targeted advertising on your devices and to send you emails. To opt-out of cross-device and browser advertising, you may follow the instructions set forth below. Please note: if you opt out of these targeted advertising cookies, your opt-out will be specific to the web browser or mobile device from which you accessed the opt-out. If you use multiple devices or browsers, you will need to opt out of each browser or device that you use.

We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site and on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.

Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) [Consumer Choice Page](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by DAA companies, or if you are in the EU you can visit [http://youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu/).

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA, your opt out may not be effective.

You can find more information about cookies by visiting the following information websites:

* www.aboutcookies.org
* www.allaboutcookies.org

### 4\. Special Categories of Personal Data

Unless we specifically request or invite it, we ask that you not send us or disclose to us any Personal Data considered to be “special” under certain countries’ laws. Special data includes information relating to an individual's physical or mental health, as well as biometric or genetic data.

Where, in relation to certain specific products and services, we do process any special categories of your Personal Data, we will do so on the basis of your explicit consent, which we will obtain from you via a separate consent form.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction, to the extent legally authorized.

We take all reasonable steps, as required by law, to ensure the safety, privacy and integrity of such data and information and, where appropriate, enter into contracts with such third parties to protect the privacy and integrity of such data and any information supplied.

### 6\. Objection to Processing

In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require Teleflex not to process your Personal Data for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on an appropriate legal basis. If you object to such processing, Teleflex will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

Where we transfer store, and process your personal information outside of the EEA or the UK, we have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection, such as putting in place standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or another relevant body, or another measure that has been approved as adducing adequate safeguards for the protection of personal information when transferred to a third country. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal information is transferred outside of the EEA or the UK; you may request such details by contacting us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.
