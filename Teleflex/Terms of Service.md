TERMS OF USE
------------

* * *

Welcome to www.teleflex.com. Teleflex Incorporated and its affiliates (collectively, “Teleflex”) provide information, material and features to you (“you” or “your”) on www.teleflex.com as well as other websites, portals and social media sites that Teleflex operates (collectively, the “Sites”). Your use of each such Site is subject to these terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”). By using any such Site, you agree to all of the Terms of Use. Please read them carefully. If you do not wish to agree to the Terms of Use, please refrain from using the Site.

Your use of some Sites may be subject to additional terms and conditions. Teleflex will make you aware of those additional terms and conditions when you use any such Site, and you must agree to such additional terms and conditions before you can use that Site. If there are additional terms applicable to a Site, then those additional terms will not be applicable to any other Site. If you breach any such additional terms, your access and use of the applicable Site will be terminated, but not your access or use of any other Site for which you continue to comply with the applicable terms.

Additionally, a Site may allow you to purchase products from Teleflex; in those cases, your use of that Site and the transactions conducted through that Site may be further governed by a customer agreement that you have with Teleflex (a “Master Customer Agreement”) as well as terms and conditions of sale and refund policies that will be provided to you by Teleflex. The Master Customer Agreement and such other terms and conditions and policies will govern solely with respect to the purchase of the products; these Terms of Use and any additional terms applicable to a given Site will govern your use of that Site.

You should not construe anything on a Site as medical advice. Information provided through the Site is not intended to replace consultation with a qualified medical professional. Teleflex cannot answer specific medical questions in your e-mail requests or social media posts. You should consult a medical professional for diagnosis and treatment. **Teleflex does not practice medicine or provide medical services or advice and the information on any Site should not be considered medical advice. Do not consult a Site in a medical emergency.**

### PRIVACY

### COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

You agree to comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations regarding your use of a Site. You must be at least 18 years old to use any Site.

Some Sites may require you to establish an account with a user ID or password (collectively, “User Credentials”). You may only use the User Credentials for the Site for which they were issued. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your User Credentials, and you are responsible for all activities that occur using your User Credentials. You agree not to share your User Credentials with unauthorized users, let unauthorized users access or use your User Credentials or take any other action that might jeopardize the security of your User Credentials. You agree to notify Teleflex if any of your User Credentials is lost, stolen, if you are aware of any unauthorized use of your User Credentials or if you know of any other breach of security in relation to any Site. All the information that you provide when registering for an account and otherwise through any Site must be accurate, complete and up to date.

Even if you withdraw or request a return of any submitted content, such a request shall not terminate or impact the use rights granted by Teleflex to third parties regarding such submitted content prior to such removal. By submitting content, you also warrant and represent that the content of the submission is accurate, not misleading, and will not violate the rights of any individual. If you do not wish to grant such rights to Teleflex, do not submit content to a Site.
