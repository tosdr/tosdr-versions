Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the Website, which will enable them to collect data on our behalf about how you interact with our Website over time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, pages or features, and better understand online activity. Unless described in this notice, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes. We have contracts in place with our data processors, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us.

**_In Short:_** _We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information._

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.

**6\. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?**

**_In Short:_** _We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own._

Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?" above), in the United States, and other countries.

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.

European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:

We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Data Processing Agreements that include Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request/are available here: https://www.seedsgives.com/terms-and- conditions. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**8\. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**

**_In Short:_** _We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures._

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.

**9\. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?**

**_In Short:_** _In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time._

In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index\_en.htm.

If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: [https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at team@seedsgives.com.

**Opting out of email marketing:** You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send. You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

**10\. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

**11\. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?**

**_In Short:_** _Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information._

**Terms of Use**

The seedsgives.com website is comprised of various web pages, online courses, and mobile in-app products operated by Seeds Inc. ("Seeds"). The site is offered to you (the “User”) conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the "Terms"). Your use of seedsgives.com constitutes your agreement to all such terms. Please read these terms carefully, and keep a copy of them for your reference. 

Seeds allows people to ask for monetary help, and receive it as a gift from others. In using all Seeds platforms, you confirm that you understand that there is no guarantee that any Request for Help will be granted within a certain timeframe, or at all.

**Refund Policy**

In registering for any online course, you confirm that you understand that because SEEDS are included with tuition and you can sell them on the decentralized market, making the instruction effectively either low cost or free, course refunds are not available.

After providing the necessary recipient wallet information, those who pay for the course in full up front will receive $1999 worth of SEEDS, at market price at the time of their payment. After providing the necessary recipient wallet information, those who choose the monthly recurring option will receive a fraction of $1999 with each successful monthly payment, i.e. if the option of 10 monthly payments of $239 has been selected, with each successful payment, 1/10th of $1999 in SEEDS will be made available to the course student, in a timeframe no less frequent than quarterly.

When registering for a course payment plan, you confirm that you understand that you are entering into an agreement in which full payment for the course is required, and a cancellation of your payment plan before completion is a breach of these Terms which may result in collection.

You also confirm that you understand that any insight shared by Seeds and its representatives on any platform is an opinion, and is for information purposes only. It is not intended to be investment or financial advice.

**Anonymous Gifts and SEEDS Awards, and Nurturance of the SEEDS-ETH Pool**

When gifts are made anonymously in cryptocurrency, in order to comply with AML/KYC legislation in the United States, SEEDS awards may not be sent. Anonymous gifts will be designated to the general pool, as are recurring gifts, and will be allotted to needs through internal decision-making processes (about which more details are provided in our [FAQ](https://www.seedsgives.com/faq)). As with all gifts, 100% of the value given will go to those in need, and will be sent in SEEDS.

If a gift is of suspicious origin and/or there is any indication that awarding SEEDS, or sending a gift in SEEDS, may jeopardize the well-being of the Seeds community or the SEEDS-ETH pool, Seeds Inc. will take any necessary steps to set boundaries to prevent this, which may include delaying a SEEDS transfer, creating a vesting schedule for its disbursal, or, when no other option is available, preventing its transfer. This may include instances in which there has been a change to a Request for Help such that it impacts the decision to allot funds from our general pool toward that Request for Help, e.g. the removal of the original requester from a project, etc.

You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available or provided for through the Site. 

All content included as part of the Service, such as text, graphics, logos, images, as well as the compilation thereof, and any software used on the Site, is the property of Seeds or its suppliers and protected by copyright and other laws that protect intellectual property and proprietary rights. You agree to observe and abide by all copyright and other proprietary notices, legends or other restrictions contained in any such content and will not make any changes thereto.

Seeds content is not for resale. Your use of the Site does not entitle you to make any unauthorized use of any protected content, and in particular you will not delete or alter any proprietary rights or attribution notices in any content. You will use protected content solely for your personal use, and will make no other use of the content without the express written permission of Seeds and the copyright owner. You agree that you do not acquire any ownership rights in any protected content. We do not grant you any licenses, express or implied, to the intellectual property of Seeds or our licensors except as expressly authorized by these Terms. 

**Use of Communication Services** **& Receipt of SEEDS**

The Site may contain chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with the public at large or with a group (collectively, "Communication Services"). You agree to use the Communication Services only to post, send and receive messages and material that are proper and related to the particular Communication Service. 

By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using a Communication Service, you will not: defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others; publish, post, upload, distribute or disseminate any inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful topic, name, material or information; upload files that contain software or other material protected by intellectual property laws (or by rights of privacy of publicity) unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents; upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of another's computer; advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any business purpose, unless such Communication Service specifically allows such messages; conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters; download any file posted by another user of a Communication Service that you know, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally distributed in such manner; falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper notices or proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of software or other material contained in a file that is uploaded; restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Communication Services; violate any code of conduct or other guidelines which may be applicable for any particular Communication Service; harvest or otherwise collect information about others, including e-mail addresses, without their consent; violate any applicable laws or regulations. 

Seeds has no obligation to monitor the Communication Services. However, Seeds reserves the right to review materials posted to a Communication Service and to remove any materials in its sole discretion. Seeds reserves the right to terminate your access to any or all of the Communication Services at any time without notice for any reason whatsoever. 

Seeds reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in Seeds's sole discretion. 

Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your children in any Communication Service. Seeds does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any Communication Service and, therefore, Seeds specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Service. Managers and hosts are not authorized Seeds spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of Seeds. 

Materials uploaded to a Communication Service may be subject to posted limitations on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you upload the materials. 

This agreement extends to the content of Requests for Help themselves. When a user redeems a SEED to make a Request for Help, that user is solely responsible for the content of the request. Seeds specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the content of Requests for Help and any actions resulting from your participation in giving to a Request for Help.

If an individual receiving SEEDS believes the amount received was calculated incorrectly (i.e. not reflective of the SEEDS market price at the moment the gift was made), we ask that they alert Seeds of the issue within 30 days of receiving the SEEDS. A failure to do so constitutes an agreement that the amount of SEEDS received was correct.

**Penalties for Dishonesty, Abuse & Breach of Conduct**

If and when someone is behaving with hostility, showing abusive verbal or physical action or unkindness, Seeds reserves the right to require that they step away from engagement with the Seeds community in all forms, and/or request that they step away from the community unless or until they complete a 10-day Vipassana course. Such a ban renders the offender ineligible for any Seeds-awarded bonuses, including but not limited to the SEEDS staking bonus and SEEDS sent in thanks for gifts, for its duration.

We also reserve this right if and when we discover that someone has been dishonest when completing a Request for Help form. Any active Requests for Help within the system will then be rendered void, and any funds raised toward those will be delegated to another request or requests.

Additionally, if someone is found to be abusing the bonuses in ways damaging to the Seeds community (i.e. a person who is making larger gifts to receive larger bonuses and then quickly selling those rewards on the market), they may be asked to step away from the Seeds community as well.

If someone fails to honor their commitment to pay for a course on a monthly basis or is otherwise dishonest in alleging a disputed payment, following the model used with the intention of serving the highest good of all at Vipassana meditation courses, we also reserve the right to ask that they step away from the Seeds community (including as it pertains to making Requests for Help), and they may be subject to collection of unpaid fees, including any incurred through payment disputes they initiated.

All such individuals may complete a [free Vipassana course](https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index) at more than 200 centers worldwide. If they do so and produce proof of the course’s completion, we will reconsider the ban.

Seeds reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Seeds in asserting any available defenses. 

**Arbitration** 

In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms. 

**Class Action Waiver** 

Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Seeds agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
