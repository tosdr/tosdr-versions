### Terms of Service

Last revised on 2022-11-19

### The Gist

FFQTECH operates the TextSynth service, which we hope you use. If you use it, please use it responsibly. If you don't, we'll have to terminate your account.

For paid accounts, you will charged when you purchase credits. You can cancel anytime, but there are no refunds.

The Terms of Service, TextSynth itself, and our prices can change at any time. We'll try to warn you about major changes to the Terms of Service, TextSynth or our prices, but we make no guarantees.

That's the basic idea, but You must read through the entire Terms of Service below and agree with all the details before You use any of our services (whether or not you have created an account).

### Your Agreement with FFQTECH

Your use of the FFQTECH service is governed by this agreement (the "Terms"). "FFQTECH" means FFQTECH SARL.

"Customer Data" means any data you submit to FFQTECH for the purpose of using the Service. "Content" means all content generated by FFQTECH on your behalf (including metric data) and does not include Customer Data.

In order to use the Service, You (the "Customer", "You", or "Your") must first agree to the Terms. You understand and agree that FFQTECH will treat Your use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

FFQTECH may make changes to the Terms from time to time. You may reject the changes by terminating Your account. You understand and agree that if You use the Service after the date on which the Terms have changed, FFQTECH will treat Your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.
