All refund requests are processed by our support team during the standard working hours from Monday to Friday, and the delay of the refund processing depends on the payment method used by each user and does not depend on LE VPN.

We will usually process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via e-mail that you were entitled to a refund.
