Privacy
=======

Foreword
--------

There is nothing more important than our privacy. That's why we encrypt all IP addresses used in polls before storing them in the database. For law enforcement purposes, we store the IP address of the author of a poll in plain text for a limited time. StrawPoll is not a place for bullying, harassing others, or spreading propaganda. Please think twice before entering anyone else's personal information into a poll, because you are solely responsible for the consequences.

Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.

You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.

Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.

### Storage of the IP address

This tool does not automatically transfer user data to the operators of these platforms. If users are logged into one or more of the social networks, the Like, and Share buttons for Facebook, Twitter, etc. will display an information window in which the user can edit the text before it is sent.
