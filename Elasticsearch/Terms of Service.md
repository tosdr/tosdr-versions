Terms of Use
============

Hi, thanks for visiting Elastic! We know there is a lot of legal stuff in here, but it is important that you read these terms carefully since they describe the relationship between us and you, and set out our expectations for how you will engage with our website.

These Terms of Use will cover:

* Eligibility requirements for using the website our services;
* How you may access and use our website and services, and what we consider to be prohibited conduct;
* Access to additional features, such as trials and beta features, and use of the website as a registered user;
* How you can engage with Elastic content and third party content;
* How you can engage with the website by submitting user content; and
* What other legal rights and obligations you have, including limitations or exclusions;
* What legal rights and remedies we have; and
* What to expect in case someone violates these terms.

These Terms of Use ("**Terms**") set forth the terms and conditions under which Elasticsearch BV ("**Elasticsearch**", "**we**", "**our**" or "**us**") allows persons and entities ("**you**" or "**user(s)**") to access and use the website located at [www.elastic.co](http://www.elastic.co/), together with all services, beta trials, free trials and discussion forums offered on or through the website, and all associated websites or webpages (i) within the elastic.co domain, or (ii) published by Elasticsearch, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, the "**Site**").

Additional terms and conditions may apply to other Elastic services, including without limitation, the [Elastic Cloud Free Trial Terms](https://www.elastic.co/legal/elastic-cloud-account-terms), and such terms are incorporated into these Terms by this reference (collectively, the "**Supplemental Terms**"). If there is a conflict between these Terms and the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall control with respect to your use of the specific service or free trial. These Terms do not apply to paid versions of Elastic Cloud which are subject to a written agreement between Elasticsearch and our customers.

SHOULD YOU ELECT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, THESE TERMS, TOGETHER WITH THE ELASTICSEARCH PRIVACY STATEMENT LOCATED AT [WWW.ELASTIC.CO/LEGAL/PRIVACY-STATEMENT](https://www.elastic.co/legal/privacy-statement) ("**PRIVACY STATEMENT**"), AND ANY SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS FORM A LEGAL CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND ELASTICSEARCH (COLLECTIVELY, THE "**AGREEMENT**"). BY USING THE SITE, YOU ARE IRREVOCABLY AGREEING TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THE AGREEMENT, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE.

1. **1\. ELIGIBILITY**
    
    By using the Site, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 13 years old, you may not use the Site.
    
    If you are accessing or using the Site on behalf of a corporation, organization or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to agree to these terms on behalf of such organization and to bind such organization to the Agreement. All references to "you" in the Agreement shall include such organization, jointly and severally with you personally.
    
    If any applicable law, rule, regulation or government restriction prohibits you from using or accessing the Site, then you must immediately cease all access and use. If you nevertheless access or use the Site, you will still be bound to these Terms and shall have all the obligations, responsibilities and liabilities as if you were eligible to do so.
    
    If Elasticsearch believes that you do not meet any of these requirements we may immediately suspend or terminate your access to or use of the Site.
    
2. **2\. GENERAL USE OF THE SITE**

        * disseminate any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, 'junk mail', 'spam', 'chain letters', 'pyramid schemes', or any other form of such solicitation;
        * violate or attempt to violate, including with the use of any device, software or program, the security of this Site or otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Site, including taking any action that (i) imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure or (ii) circumvents or attempts to circumvent any technological protection measures or access controls on the Site or in a Service or use a third party or third party product to do so;

        * reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any part of the Site;
        * frame or mirror the Site or any portion(s) of the Site, or otherwise incorporate any portion of the Site in to any product or service;
        * perform any security integrity review, penetration test, load test, denial of service simulation, or vulnerability scan; or
        * to post, transmit or link to: (i) any advertisement, promotional materials or solicitation related to any product or service that is competitive with Elasticsearch products or services; (ii) software or programs which contain any harmful code, including, but not limited to, viruses, worms, time bombs or Trojan horses; (iii) content that defames, abuses, harasses, stalks, threatens, or otherwise violates the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others; (iv) content that includes racially, ethnically, or otherwise offensive language; (v) content that discusses or incites illegal activity; or (vi) content that includes explicit/obscene language or solicit/post sexually explicit images.
        
        This list of prohibitions provides examples and is not complete, exhaustive or exclusive. Elasticsearch may report to law enforcement authorities any actions that may be illegal, and any reports it receives of such conduct. When legally required or at Elasticsearch's discretion, Elasticsearch will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal activity on the Site.

We may discontinue the Beta Offering at any time and may decide not to make any of the features and functionality generally available.
            
    4. **4\. REGISTERED USE OF THE SITE**
        
        Certain features of the Site may be available only to registered users. Such features may change over time and we don't guarantee any particular feature will always be available.
        
        1. (a) **Registered Users**
            
            If you become a registered user of the Site in order to gain access to support or other limited access parts of the Site, you agree (i) that the information you provide to Elasticsearch in connection with your registration will be current, complete and accurate, (ii) if applicable, not to choose a username that violates any law or the intellectual property rights of others, or is offensive; provided that Elasticsearch reserves the right to reject the use of any user name for any reason or no reason, (iii) not to transfer, sell, convey or assign the right to use the Site to any third party without the prior written consent of Elasticsearch and (iv) not to permit any third party to use your user name, email address and/or password to access the Site.
            
        2. (b) **Accounts and Passwords**
            
            You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information, including your password, and for any and all activity that occurs under or through your account. You agree to notify Elasticsearch immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or password, or any other breach of security.
            
            Elasticsearch reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to deny, restrict, suspend, discontinue, or terminate your account, with or without prior notice or explanation, for any or no reason, without any liability to you.
            
    5. **5\. CONTENT**
        1. (a) **Elasticsearch Content**
            
            Except as may be otherwise noted, the information, materials (including, without limitation, HTML, text, graphics, audio, video, blog posts, visual interfaces, photographs, registered and unregistered trademarks, Marks (as defined below), logos, computer code, artwork, documents, white papers, press releases, data sheets, product descriptions, software and FAQs and other content) available on or from the Site (collectively, "**Elasticsearch Content**"), including but not limited to the selection, expression, coordination, arrangement and "look and feel" of such Elasticsearch Content, are owned, controlled or licensed by Elasticsearch and are protected by trademark, copyright and patent laws, as well as various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws. Elasticsearch and its licensors expressly retain all right, title and interest in and to the Elasticsearch Content, including and without limitation, all intellectual property rights therein and thereto.

            Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, no part of the Site or the Site Content may be publicly displayed, reproduced, republished, uploaded, retransmitted, published, modified, adapted, encoded or translated.
            
        2. (b) **Third Party Content**
            
            In addition to Elasticsearch Content, the Site may contain information and materials provided to Elasticsearch by third parties (collectively, "**Third Party Content**"). Third Party Content is the copyrighted work of its owner, which expressly retains all right title and interest in and to the Third Party Content, including, without limitation, all intellectual property rights therein and thereto.

        3. (c) **Software**
            
            To the extent that the Site contains Elasticsearch Content or Third Party Content that is software available for download ("**Software**"), such Software is subject to, and your use of such Software is governed by, an applicable license agreement (each a "**License Agreement**") accompanying, provided with, linked to or embedded in, such Software. You may not use any Software unless you first read and agree to all of the terms and conditions of the applicable License Agreement. To the extent Elasticsearch separately makes available other open-source software ("**OSS**") for download, such code is governed by the terms of the applicable OSS license.
            
    6. **6\. USER CONTENT**
        1. (a) **Submitting User Content**

            If you choose to make publicly available any of your personal information, confidential information or any other sensitive information through the Site, you do so at your own risk. You acknowledge that your User Content and any information you post is not confidential and will be publicly accessible to any and all users of the Site. We have no control over and are not responsible for any use or misuse (including reproduction, distribution or displaying) by any third party of your User Content.
            
            We may modify or adapt your User Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to the User Content as necessary to conform and adapt the same to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.
            
        2. (b) **License grant to Elasticsearch**

In addition, the Site may be mirrored, and other websites operated or controlled by Elasticsearch may be located, in various countries. Elasticsearch makes no representation or warranty that all of the features of this Site will be available to you from specific countries, or that the Site Content is permitted to be accessed from any country. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any decision by you to use the Site from your location, and that such use may be subject to, and that you are responsible for, compliance with applicable local laws.
            
        2. (b) **Feedback**
            
            If you send or transmit any communications, comments, questions, suggestions, or related materials to Elasticsearch, whether by letter, email, telephone, or otherwise (collectively, "**Feedback**"), suggesting or recommending changes to the Site, Site Content or any services offered through the Site, including, without limitation, new features or functionality relating thereto, all such Feedback is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and non-proprietary. You hereby grant to Elasticsearch a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, irrevocable, perpetual license, including the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, to use or incorporate into the Site and/or any products or services any and all Feedback.

        3. (c) **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**
            
            This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or any laws based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA). All suits hereunder will be brought solely in Federal Court for the Northern District of California, or if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any California State Court located in Santa Clara County.

            If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. Elasticsearch's failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such terms. The Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and Elasticsearch and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and Elasticsearch about this Site. The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.
            
        4. (d) **Waiver of Rights and Remedies**
            
            Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Our rights, powers and remedies in these Terms, including without limitation the right to suspend, restrict or terminate any use of the Site, are cumulative and in addition to and not in substitution for any right, power or remedy that may be available to us at law or in equity.
            
        5. (e) **Severability**
            
            If any provision of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, such invalidity or unenforceability will attach only to such provision or part thereof and the remaining part of such provision and all other provisions hereof will continue in full force and effect.
            
        6. (f) **Assignment and Inurement**
            
            We may at any time assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without notice to you. You may not assign these Terms and Conditions without our prior, written consent. These Terms and Conditions will inure to the benefit of and bind you and us and our respective personal and legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.
            
        7. (g) **Relationship**
            
            The parties are independent contractors. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, fiduciary, employment or agency relationship exists between us and you as a result of these Terms or use of the Site. There are no third-party beneficiaries of these Terms. Neither party has the authority to bind or act on behalf of the other party in any capacity or circumstance whether by contract or otherwise.
            
        8. (h) **Force Majeure**
            
            Neither party will be responsible for a failure to fulfill its obligations under these Terms or for delay in doing so if such failure or delay is due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, such as acts of nature, acts of government, war, riots, strikes and accidents in transportation, but excluding a lack of financing, cash or credit.
            
        9. (i) **Entire Agreement.**
            
            These Terms, as amended from time to time, and the Agreement, including any and all documents, websites, rules, terms and policies referenced herein, constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to the matters referred to in these Terms and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, whether electronic, oral or written, between us and you with respect to such matters.
            
        10. (j) **Contact Us**
