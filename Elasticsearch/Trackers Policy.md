Elastic Cookie Privacy Statement
================================

Effective Date: January 24, 2024

This Cookie Statement (the "Cookie Statement" or "Statement") explains how Elasticsearch, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Elastic," "we," "us" and "our") use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies (collectively "Automatic Data Collection Tools") when you visit, interact with or use any of our websites, social media pages, online advertisements, marketing communications (our "Online Properties"). This Statement explains these technologies and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

We may also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to collect, use and share information in connection with the use of our products and services but this Cookie Statement does not cover that use.

For details regarding the Automatic Data Collection Tools we use in connection with our products and services, see [Elastic's Product Privacy Statement](https://www.elastic.co/legal/product-privacy-statement).

[Cookies We Use](#cookies-we-use)  
[Other Automatic Data Collection Tools](#other-automatic-data-collection-tools)  
[Your Options to Control our Use of Cookies/Automatic Data Collection Tools](#your-options)  
[Other Information](#other-information)  
[How to Contact Us](#contact)

[](#)Cookies We Use
-------------------

When you visit any Elastic online property, we may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies. We use the following types of cookies:

* **Strictly Necessary:** These trackers are used for activities that are strictly necessary to operate or deliver the service you requested from us and, therefore, do not require you to consent.
* **Basic interactions & functionalities:** These trackers enable basic interactions and functionalities that allow you to access selected features of our service and facilitate your communication with us.
* **Measurement:** These trackers help us to measure traffic and analyze your behavior with the goal of improving our service.
* **Targeting & Advertising:** These trackers help us to deliver personalized marketing content to you based on your behavior and to operate, serve and track ads.
* **Experience Enhancement:** These trackers help us to provide a personalized user experience by improving the quality of your preference management options, and by enabling the interaction with external networks and platforms.

[Learn more details about the cookies](https://www.elastic.co/legal/cookie-statement/all-cookies)

[](#)Other Automatic Data Collection Tools


--------------------------------------------

### Web Beacons

We may use and permit select third parties to use web beacons (usually in combination with cookies) to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with an email or other communications to measure performance and to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

A web beacon (also known as a web bug or clear GIFs) is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1-pixel x 1-pixel) that can be embedded in online content, pictures, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a specific email message, determine the date and time when you viewed the beacon and the IP address of your device. For instance, we may include web beacons on our websites and in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether our messages have been opened or acted upon and whether our mailing tools are working correctly.

### Embedded Web Links

Emails from us often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the web, after redirection through our servers. The redirection system allows us to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our communications and marketing initiatives. In emails, such web links may also allow us to determine whether you have clicked a link in an email, and information about this interaction may be connected to your personal identity.

[](#)Your Options to Control our Use of Cookies/Automatic Data Collection Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you do not want to allow cookies or only want to enable the use of certain cookies, please refer to your browser settings. You can also use your browser settings to withdraw your consent to our use of cookies and delete cookies that have already been set. Your browser help menu contains information about the process of opting out. Note that by disabling certain categories of cookies, you may be prevented from accessing some features of our sites, and certain content or functionality may not be available.

**Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:** Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt-out of interest-based advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

If you are in the EU and would like to opt-out of third party cookies relating to interest-based advertising, please go to [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

In the US, the Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt-out of many advertising cookies. Please visit [www.networkadvertising.org](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) to learn more. Note that opting out does not mean that you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the company or companies from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.

Other opt-out mechanisms:

* Google Opt-out page - [https://adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/)
* Facebook Opt-out page - [https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217)
* LinkedIn Opt-out page - [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62931/manage-advertising-preferences](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62931/manage-advertising-preferences)

**Disabling web beacons:** You may be able to disable web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in messages you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a web beacon or other Automatic Data Collection Tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities. For more information, refer to the details provided by your email software or service provider. Web beacons may also be rendered ineffective in some circumstances by opting out of cookies or amending your cookie settings in your browser.

**Disabling embedded web links:** If you do not want us to collect information about the links that you click, you can choose privacy settings in your browser and email client that will restrict this information.

[](#)Other Information
----------------------

**Data Retention.** We retain information collected in connection with the Automatic Data Collection Tools for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Statement or where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so.

**Changes to this Cookie Statement.** This Cookie Statement is subject to occasional revision. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use personal data, we will take appropriate measures to inform our customers, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. We will provide notice of any material Cookie Statement changes if and where required by applicable data protection laws.

The date of the most recent update to this Cookie Statement can be found by checking the "effective" date displayed at the top of this Cookie Statement.
