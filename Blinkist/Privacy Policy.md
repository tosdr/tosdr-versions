Blinkist User Research Privacy Policy
=====================================

**Last Edited: October, 2021**

First of all, we (“**Blinkist**”) would like to thank you for participating in our user research. This is incredibly helpful for us to be able to constantly improve our product. We want you to feel confident that your data is in safe hands when you participate in our user research, which is why we’re committing to collect, use and process your personal data only in accordance with this Blinkist User Research Privacy Policy and with all relevant legal data protection regulations. By participating in our user research, you agree that we may process your personal data as described herein.

Below we give you more information about our data protection regulations. Please note that not all of these regulations apply to you in each and every case - this means, we do not use every single tool in every single case. In particular, if we conduct an online interview with you and we want to record it, we will of course always explicitly inform you of this.

### RESPONSIBLE ENTITY & CONTACT DETAILS

The entity responsible for processing your personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is Blinks Labs GmbH, Sonnenallee 223, 12059 Berlin, Germany (“**Blinkist**”). You can contact our privacy team at any time for further information on privacy issues via email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.blinkist.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Our data protection officer is Benjamin Kühn, and he can be reached either by post \[HC Plus | Geneststraße 5 | D-10829 Berlin\] or via the above mentioned email address, under the subject “For the attention of the data protection officer”.

### COLLECTING, PROCESSING, AND USING YOUR PERSONAL DATA

#### PERSONAL DATA

Personal data means any information which is related to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes (for example), but is not limited to, your name, email address, or photo or video material of your person that is created during the User Research. This may also include your age range, gender identity, country of residence or comfort with the English language - as this data is not necessarily personal in itself, but a combination of all this data can be used to identify you as a person.

#### COLLECTING, PROCESSING, AND USING PERSONAL DATA

For the purposes of managing Blinkist’s User Research, we will collect, process, and use your personal data that you have disclosed to us, that means if you have expressly consented pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR - usually this means that you have submitted a consent form with your data or, for example, an application for the Blinkist User Research Panel. With the exception of any mandatory fields marked with asterisks, you decide yourself which data you are willing to enter and share with us.

Your data will be transmitted to the user research department in charge and used exclusively for the purposes of the respective research study. This also includes using the data to contact you. Your data will not be disclosed to any third party – other than in the context of data processing commissions – without your express consent.

### UNMODERATED REMOTE TESTING VIA USERTESTING AND MY RECRUIT

Occasionally we will send invites to participate in a remote unmoderated user test that is hosted and launched via the UserTesting platform and a URL generated by their My Recruit service. We use UserTesting to be able to launch unmoderated app, website and prototype test sessions concerning Blinkist or other related products. Participation in these tests are of course voluntary.

By participating in the study, your voice and screen will be recorded only during the session. UserTesting ceases collecting any information after the session ends and does not record your mouse clicks or keystrokes. UserTesting does not access your files or monitor anything from your device. Following the completion of the session, a recording is made available to the Blinkist User Research department. We may then highlight certain parts of the feedback that you provided, and share your feedback and video with our Design and Product teams to spark discussion, generate and validate product ideas and solutions. Videos are stored in an encrypted form on UserTesting and can’t be viewed by the public.
