1\. Commitment and general principles
-------------------------------------

We ([DigiDNA LLC](https://www.zefix.ch/en/search/entity/list/firm/916184?name=digidna&searchType=exact), hereafter DigiDNA) commit to comply with Switzerland's [New Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP)](https://www.kmu.admin.ch/kmu/en/home/facts-and-trends/digitization/data-protection/new-federal-act-on-data-protection-nfadp.html), as well as [European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj). Regardless of the laws applicable to you, we are firmly committed to upholding the highest standards and principles of data protection and privacy.

**Our apps are built to empower our users by giving them broad access to their own data. We do not access, nor have access to, any user data handled by our apps: files are stored on our users' own devices, none of these files nor their contents are ever uploaded to our servers, saved, retained or shared with us or any third party.  
[Learn more about our software's security and privacy features.](https://imazing.com/security-and-privacy)**

We collect only personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for providing the best customer service. Moreover, we do not store or process any personal data ourselves. Instead, we rely on third-party services with strong ethics and privacy standards to provide our services in a way that respects our users' data and privacy (see below: [Collected data by service](#partners)).

The personal data that we do have access to is necessary for us to provide efficient customer support, license management, dispute handling (refunds), as well as timely information about the purchased product. Such data includes name, email address, type and date of purchase, license type and activation related data, as well as communications with our support team. **At no point does DigiDNA has access nor can store any sensitive payment information such as credit card number or PayPal account details.**

Our staff works in compliance with the strictest standards of care and confidentiality. Processing of your personal data is carried out in full accordance with the applicable regulations.

2\. Purposes of data processing
-------------------------------

We only collect personal data for our customer service. This includes and is limited to purchases of licenses, support tickets, and newsletter subscriptions.

For your needs as an individual customer, your email address is collected for your license management, informations on updates of the product you purchased, potential security issue warnings, and support request follow-ups.

For the needs of all current and prospective customers, we may use your data in a fully anonymized manner for product development prospects, internal statistics relevant to the satisfaction of our customers (such as general trends or preferences) or general improvements of our products and services or other business-relevant data traffic information. (Please refer to [Cookie policy](#cookie-policy) and [Collected data by service](#partners) for more information.)

3\. User management and right to information
--------------------------------------------

You may request access to your personal data at any time to view, update, or delete it. To do so, please send your request electronically via [our secure contact form](https://imazing.com/contact), or by postal mail at **DigiDNA, Boulevard des Tranchées 4, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland.**

4\. Nondisclosure of information
--------------------------------

Unless required by law or legal injunctions, we only share personal data with the partners listed in the [Collected data by service](#partners) section below and for the purposes outlined in the [Purposes of data processing](#purposes) section above.

5\. Safety & confidentiality
----------------------------

All communications between your web browser and our website, as well as between our software products and our servers, are secured by industry-standard SSL encryption.

Furthermore, access to your personal data is restricted to employees directly involved in customer support and analytics—who have been trained to observe our strict standards of care and confidentiality.

Nevertheless, it must be noted that the Internet is by nature not a completely secure space for any data; you duly understand and agree that DigiDNA is not responsible for any direct or indirect damages resulting from events such as, but not limited to, malicious third-party actions or technical failures of any nature.

6\. Cookie policy

7\. Newsletter policy
---------------------

When you acquire a license for one of our products, you are automatically subscribed to our mailing list. This enables us to keep you updated on crucial improvements to the product you've purchased. Because we operate in Apple's ever shifting environment it is important for us to communicate with our users about security updates, new features and changes implied by iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, iTunes, macOS or Windows updates. We might also inform you about other product updates, promotions or company news, but we tend to keep it to the essential—we won't swamp your inbox.

Additionally, we offer an optional opt-in subscription to our DigiDNA Deals newsletter: deals and offers on our own products or on products we hand-pick for their quality.

**We never, EVER share your email for third-party marketing purposes. That would be silly, and illegal.**

You can of course unsubscribe from any of our mailing lists at any time: every email we send contains an _Unsubscribe_ button, or using the link below. You can also review our email platform and sending partner **Mailchimp**'s privacy policy in the article dedicated to third-party providers below [Collected data by service](#mailing).

* [Unsubscribe from DigiDNA Mailing List](http://digidna.us4.list-manage1.com/unsubscribe?u=9820780b9ca506ece36277a8c&amp;id=112355e150)

8\. Customer Experience Program and crash reporting
