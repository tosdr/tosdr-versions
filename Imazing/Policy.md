1\. iMazing Licensing
---------------------

### 1.1. Device License or Subscription

In October 2020, we revised our licensing model to eliminate paid major updates. This change allows our users to enjoy continuous free upgrades and access new features at no cost.

Activating iMazing with a _Device License_ or _Subscription_ grants access to all Premium features for all Apple Mobile Devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple TV and Apple Vision Pro) associated with the license or subscription. Free features remain accessible for Apple Mobile Devices not linked to the license or subscription. A device linked to the Device License is called a _licensed device_.

License codes starting with `id` are now considered legacy licenses, while those that start with `imz` can be used with any iMazing 2 and 3 versions, and include free iMazing updates.

> ⚡ Please read our [blog post](https://imazing.com/blog/imazing-license-model) to learn more about the iMazing license model.

**Device License:**

* The Device License does not include recurring fees.
* A licensed device can be used with the current and all upcoming iMazing versions (including major upgrades) on any compatible macOS or Windows computer, for the Apple mobile device's lifetime.
* The number of Apple Mobile Devices that can be linked to the Device License is determined at the time of purchase.
* Additional device slots can be bought at any time to expand the license.
* An Apple Mobile Device linked to a Device License cannot be unlinked
* For lost or broken Apple mobile devices, please [contact](https://imazing.com/contact) our support team immediately with the details. We trust our users and will quickly handle legitimate requests.

**Subscription:**

* The subscription is renewed yearly.
* The subscription can be canceled at any time, but it will remain active until the next renewal date.
* It allows connection to a limited number of devices for a specific period:
    * _Personal Subscription_: Devices that haven't connected to iMazing within the past 9 months are automatically unlinked from the license, so they don't count towards the total number of device slots used.
    * _Business Subscription_: Devices that haven't connected to iMazing within the past 90 days are automatically unlinked from the license, so they don't count towards the total number of device slots used.
* A device linked to the subscription can be used with the current and all upcoming iMazing versions (including major upgrades) on any compatible macOS or Windows computer.
* The number of Apple Mobile Devices that can be linked to the Subscription is determined at the time of purchase.
* Additional devices can be purchased at any time to extend the subscription.

### 1.4. iMazing License Codes

DigiDNA issues License Codes for each license purchased. Your License Code defines the features and number of Apple mobile devices or computers that may be used with your License Code.

DigiDNA employs an active licensing system, which means that the status of your License Code is periodically checked by our licensing server. The End User is authorized to use each License Code to activate and use the Software within the parameters of this Licensing Policy according to this License Policy terms. Only License Codes marked as “Active” in DigiDNA’s records are considered legitimate and valid License Codes. Customer’s Active License Codes are visible on the iMazing Account platform.

### 1.5. Upgrades

All current subscriptions are always eligible to use the newest version of iMazing.

Perpetual license types sold after October 14, 2020 are eligible for free minor version updates and free major version upgrades (x.0 releases).

Legacy perpetual licenses are eligible for free minor version updates for the purchased iMazing version. Major version upgrades (x.0 releases) require a new license, available at a discounted rate.

### 1.6. License Purchase Terms

Except as expressly agreed otherwise, DigiDNA reserves the right to change Product Editions and Pricing as needed without advanced or written notification and price changes are not enforced retroactively.

Except as expressly agreed otherwise, renewals of Subscription Licenses will be at DigiDNA’s list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal. Renewal prices that incur volume, term, or other discounts may result in repricing based on current market price without regard to prior Pricing.

### 1.7. License Start Date

The license expiration date is calculated from the license start date, which is either:

* the date you purchase iMazing directly through our online store
* the date when DigiDNA accepts a purchase order from a valid reseller and delivers the License Code to the Customer

### 1.8. Multi-year Subscription & Custom Billing Options

Multi-year and custom subscriptions contain all editions and years in one SKU. Customer commits to pay for the entire length of the contract upfront.

### 1.9. Refunds

Refunds may be granted on a discretionary basis if the software fails to operate or cannot be installed. To request a refund, the Customer must create a support ticket that describes the issue they’re experiencing and be willing to attempt (or have already attempted) the remedies described by the DigiDNA support team.

Refund requests must be submitted within 30 days of purchase, and must be processed within 60 days of purchase.

### 1.10. Trial & Activation

iMazing can be used in trial mode without a license. The trial mode has no time limitation, but distinguishes between Free and Premium features. Premium features require a license. Free features are available without limitation for personal use only. iMazing Configurator and CLI features require an iMazing Business license or subscription.

Activation refers to the process of entering a license code in iMazing. Once the license code has been validated, iMazing is activated and no longer in trial mode. iMazing can be deactivated via the License menu.

2\. Disclaimers
---------------

### 2.1. Apple Environment Dependency

In the event of major changes to Apple’s software or hardware, DigiDNA cannot guarantee that its products will remain functional, and will not be liable for damages of any kind resulting from partial or total loss of compatibility.

### 2.2. Apple Beta Software Support

DigiDNA welcomes reports from users testing beta releases of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, but is under no obligation to provide compatibility updates for such beta releases. DigiDNA may also be unable to provide technical support for such users.

DigiDNA typically releases a new, minor version of iMazing very quickly subsequent to any final iOS, iPadOS, or macOS, or Windows releases that require such compatibility updates.

### 2.3. Support for Deprecated Products

DigiDNA strives to ensure the latest version of its products are compatible with Apple’s newest software and hardware releases, but legacy and deprecated products may not be updated for such compatibility.
