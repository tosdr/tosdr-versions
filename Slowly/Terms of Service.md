Terms of Service
----------------

Last updated September 13, 2024

**INTRODUCTION**

We are Slowly Communications Ltd. (‘Slowly’, ‘Company’, ‘we’, ‘us’, or ‘our’), a company registered in the United Kingdom at 3rd floor, 86-90 Paul St, London, England EC2A 4NE. 

We operate the website [https://slowly.app](https://slowly.app/) (the ‘Site’), the mobile application Slowly (the ‘App’), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the ‘Legal Terms’) (collectively, the ‘Services’).

These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (‘you’), and Slowly Communications Ltd., concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the ‘Last updated’ date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.

**2\. TYPES OF CONTENT**

There are three types of content that you will be able to access on the App:

1. content that you provide (“Your Content”);
2. content that members provide (“Member Content”); and
3. content that Slowly provides (“Our Content”).

**Your Content**

_You are responsible for Your Content. Don’t share anything that you wouldn’t want others to see, that would violate this Agreement, or that may expose you or us to legal liability._

You are solely responsible and liable for Your Content, and, therefore, you agree to indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content.

You represent and warrant to us that the information you provide to us or any other user is accurate, and that you will update your account information as necessary to ensure its accuracy.

The content included on your individual profile should be relevant to the intended use of our Services. You may not upload any Prohibited Content, and your content must further comply with the [Community Guidelines](https://slowly.app/community-guidelines/). You may not display any personal contact, banking information, or peer-to-peer payment information, whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, social handles, URLs, credit/debit card, peer-to-peer payment user name, or other banking details). If you choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, you do so at your own risk. We strongly encourage you to use caution in disclosing any personal information online.

Your individual profile will be visible to other people around the world, so be sure that you are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. You acknowledge and agree that Your Content may be viewed by other users, and, notwithstanding these Terms, other users may share Your Content with third parties. 

You understand and agree that we may monitor or review Your Content, and we have the right to remove, delete, edit, limit, or block or prevent access to any of Your Content at any time at our sole discretion. Furthermore, you understand and agree that we have no obligation to display or review Your Content.

**Member Content**

_While you will have access to Member Content, it is not yours and you may not copy or use Member Content for any purpose except as contemplated by these Terms._

Other users will also share content on our Services. Member Content belongs to the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed at the direction of that user.

You should always carefully review and independently verify Member Content for accuracy. Other users may use tools to generate or enhance content based on the Member Content they provide.  Member Content may include biassed, incorrect, harmful, offensive, or misleading information. Other users are responsible for their Member Content, as well as any and all decisions made, actions taken, and failures to take action based on their use of Member Content. 

You do not have any rights in relation to Member Content, and, unless expressly authorised by Slowly, you may only use Member Content to the extent that your use is consistent with our Services’ purpose of allowing us to communicate with and meet one another. You may not copy the Member Content or use Member Content for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate your account if you misuse Member Content.

**Our Content**

The rest of the content on our Services belongs to Slowly. Any other text, content, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds, artwork, and other intellectual property appearing on Slowly are owned, controlled or licensed by us and are protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law rights. All right, title and interest in and to Our Content remains with us at all times.

We grant you a non-exclusive, limited, personal, non-transferable, revocable, licence to access and use Our Content, without the right to sublicense, under the following conditions:

* You shall not use, sell, modify, or distribute Our Content except as permitted by the functionality of the App;
* You shall not use our name in metatags, keywords and/or hidden text;
* You shall not create derivative works from Our Content or commercially exploit Our Content, in whole or in part, in any way; and
* You shall use Our Content for lawful purposes only.
* We reserve all other rights.

**Prohibited Content**

We want our users to freely communicate on Slowly, but we have to impose restrictions on certain content that:

* Could reasonably be deemed to be offensive or to harass, abuse or cause psychological distress to another person;
* Is obscene, pornographic, violent or contains nudity;
* Is abusive, threatening, discriminatory or that promotes or encourages racism, sexism, hatred or bigotry;
* Encourages or facilitates any illegal activity including, without limitation, terrorism, inciting racial hatred or the submission of which in itself constitutes committing a criminal offence;
* Encourages or facilitates any activity that may result in harm to the user or another person, including, but not limited to, promotion of self-harm, dangerous challenges, violent extremism,
* Is defamatory, libellous, or untrue;
* Relates to commercial activities (including, without limitation, sales, competitions, promotions, and advertising, solicitation for services, sex work, “sugar daddy” or “sugar baby” relationships, links to other websites or premium line telephone numbers);
* Involves or facilitates the transmission of spam;
* Contains any spyware, adware, viruses, corrupt files, or other malicious code designed to disrupt, damage, interfere with, intercept, or expropriate data or personal information, whether from Slowly or any other source.
* Infringes upon any third party’s rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and privacy rights);
* Includes the image or likeness of another person without that person’s consent (or in the case of a minor, the minor’s parent or guardian);
* Is inconsistent with the intended use of the Services; or 
* May damage the reputation of Slowly, including defamatory statements or content that promotes the misuse of the Service.

The uploading or sharing of content that violates these Terms (“Prohibited Content”) may result in the immediate suspension or termination of your account.

**3\. RESTRICTIONS**

We are dedicated to fostering a positive and respectful community and have zero tolerance for inappropriate content or behaviour, both on and off the Services. If you encounter any inappropriate content or misconduct, we encourage you to report it. You can do so by using the ‘Report User’ option, accessible via the three-dot button in the upper right corner of a user’s profile, or by contacting Customer Support.

As set forth in our Privacy Policy, we may share data between our affiliates for the safety and security of our users and may take necessary actions if we believe you have violated these Terms, including banning you from our Services and/or preventing you from creating new accounts. You understand and agree that we may not share information with you regarding your account if doing so would potentially impair the safety or privacy of our other users.

**4\. PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS**

_You will have the opportunity to purchase products and services from Slowly. If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew – and you will be charged – until you cancel._

Slowly may offer products and services for purchase through Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or other external services authorised by Slowly (each, an “External Service,” and any purchases made thereon, an “External Service Purchase”). Slowly may also offer products and services for purchase via credit card or other payment processors on the Website or inside the App (“Internal Purchases”). If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew until you cancel, in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase, as further described below. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your subscription benefits until the end of your subscription period, at which point it will expire.

Because our Services may be utilised without a subscription, cancelling your subscription does not remove your profile from our Services. If you wish to fully terminate your account, you must terminate your account as further described below.

Slowly operates a global business, and our pricing varies based on a number of factors. We frequently offer promotional rates – which can vary based on region, length of subscription, bundle size, past purchases, account activity and more. We also regularly test new features and payment options. If you do not timely cancel your subscription, your subscription will be renewed at the full price as indicated when the purchase was made, without any additional action by you. 

To the extent permissible by law, we reserve the right, including without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue making available any product, feature, service or other offering; to impose conditions on the honouring of any coupon, discount, offer or other promotion; to bar any user from making any transaction; and to refuse to provide any user with any product, service or other offering. 

**EXTERNAL SERVICE PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS**

When making a purchase on the Service, you may have the option to pay through an External Service, such as with your Apple ID or Google Play account (“your External Service Account”), and your External Service Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms applicable to your External Service Account. Some External Services may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live, which may change from time to time.

**SUBSCRIPTIONS**

If your External Service Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your External Service Account will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, the subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period you agreed to when subscribing. If you received a discounted promotional offer, your price may go up per the terms of that offer following the initial subscription period for any subsequent renewal period.

If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your External Service Account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the App from your device. For example, if you subscribed using your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by Apple, not Slowly. To cancel a purchase made with your Apple ID, go to Settings within the app , and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at Apple Support.

Similarly, if you subscribed on Google Play, cancellation is handled by Google. To cancel a purchase made through Google Play, launch the Google Play app on your mobile device and navigate to Settings. You can also request assistance at Google Play. 

If you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use the cancelled service until the end of your then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.

If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your External Service Account, Slowly may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion, on the basis that you have determined that you do not want a Slowly subscription. In the event that your chargeback or other payment reversal is overturned, please contact Customer Support. Slowly will retain all funds charged to your External Service Account until you cancel your subscription through your External Service Account. Certain users may be entitled to request a refund. See below for more information.

**VIRTUAL CURRENCY**

When you purchase virtual currency (Coins), you do not own them. Instead, you receive a limited right to use them for eligible services and Virtual Items on Slowly, such as stamps, avatars, and the purchase of virtual gifts for other users.

Purchases of Coins are non-refundable and non-transferable, even if they expire or are revoked or discontinued. We may change the purchase price for Coins at any time, as well as the ways you can use Coins. We reserve the right to revoke or stop issuing Coins at any time without notice, refund, or compensation, and to set expiration dates for Coins. Coins may not be redeemed for any sum of money or monetary value. If you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason, you will lose all accumulated Coins without refund or other compensation. You agree that we will have no liability to you based on our exercise of our rights with respect to Coins.

**VIRTUAL ITEMS**

Virtual items, such as stamps, avatars, and gifts, are non-refundable. Slowly reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to manage, regulate, modify, or remove Virtual Items at any time, including actions that may affect their perceived value or purchase price, if applicable. Slowly will not be liable to you or any third party for exercising these rights. The transfer of Virtual Items is strictly prohibited; you may not sell, redeem, or transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity. Virtual Items may only be redeemed through our Services.

All purchases and redemptions of Virtual Items made through our Services are final and non-refundable. You acknowledge that Slowly is under no obligation to provide refunds for any reason, and that unused Virtual Items will not result in any monetary or other compensation if your account is closed, whether voluntarily or involuntarily.

**REFUNDS**

Generally, all purchases are final and nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, except if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.

For subscribers residing in the EU, EEA, UK, and Switzerland:

In accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days after the subscription begins. Please note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription starts.

For subscribers residing in Germany: 

You may terminate your subscription after it has renewed with a notice period of one month. Your right to terminate for cause remains unaffected.

For subscribers and purchasers of Virtual Items residing in the Republic of Korea:

In accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund of your subscription and/or unused Virtual Items during the 7 days following the purchase. Please note that this 7-day period commences upon the purchase.

For subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Wisconsin and Israel:

You may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the date you subscribed. In the event that you die before the end of your subscription period, your estate shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your death. In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use our Services) before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your disability by providing the Company notice in the same manner as you request a refund as described below.

If any of the above apply to you and you subscribed using your Apple ID, your refund requests are handled by Apple, not Slowly. To request a refund, please contact your External Service directly; for example using your Apple device, go to Settings > iTunes & App Stores > \[click on your Apple ID\] > View Apple ID > Purchase History. Find the transaction and select “Report a Problem.” You can also request a refund at Apple Support. 

For any other purchase, please contact Slowly Customer Support with your order number (see your confirmation email) by mailing or delivering a signed and dated notice which states that you, the buyer, are cancelling this Agreement, or words of similar effect. Please also include the email address or telephone number associated with your account along with your order number. This notice shall be sent to:

Slowly Communications Ltd.

3rd floor, 86-90 Paul St

London, England EC2A 4NE

United Kingdom

**5\. ACCOUNT TERMINATION**

You can delete your account at any time by logging into the App, going to “Settings”, clicking “Delete Account”, and following the instructions to complete the deletion process. However, you will need to cancel / manage any External Service Purchases through your External Service Account (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store) to avoid additional billing.

Slowly reserves the right to investigate and, if appropriate, suspend or terminate your account without a refund if Slowly believes that you have violated these Terms, misused our Services, or behaved in a way that Slowly regards as inappropriate or unlawful, on or off our Services. We reserve the right to make use of any personal, technological, legal, or other means available to enforce the Terms, at any time without liability and without the obligation to give you prior notice, including, but not limited to, preventing you from accessing the Services.

If your account is terminated by you or by Slowly for any reason, these Terms continue and remain enforceable between you and Slowly, and you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases made. Your information will be maintained and deleted in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

**6\. ADS AND THIRD-PARTY CONTENT**

Our Services may contain advertisements and promotions offered by third parties and links to other websites or resources.  In addition, our Services may allow you to watch an advertisement in exchange for Virtual Currency or Virtual Items; Slowly does not guarantee that you will always be eligible to watch such advertisements, or that any such advertisements will be available. Slowly may also provide non-commercial links or references to third parties within its content. Slowly is not responsible for the availability (or lack of availability) of any external websites or resources or their content. Furthermore, Slowly is not responsible for, and does not endorse, any products or services that may be offered by third-party websites or resources.

Please be advised the Services are hosted in the United States. If you access the Services from any other region of the world with laws or other requirements governing personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable laws in the United States, then through your continued use of the Services, you are transferring your data to the United States, and you expressly consent to have your data transferred to and processed in the United States.

We respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that any material available on or through the Services infringes upon any copyright you own or control, please immediately notify us using the contact information provided below (a ‘Notification’). A copy of your Notification will be sent to the person who posted or stored the material addressed in the Notification. Please be advised that pursuant to applicable law you may be held liable for damages if you make material misrepresentations in a Notification. Thus, if you are not sure that material located on or linked to by the Services infringes your copyright, you should consider first contacting an attorney.

**9\. TERM AND TERMINATION**

These Legal Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE LEGAL TERMS OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION.

**11\. GOVERNING LAW**

These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of the United Kingdom, and the use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sales of Goods is expressly excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by obligatory provisions of the law in your country to residence. Slowly Communications Ltd. and yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England, which means that you may make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in regards to these Legal Terms in the United Kingdom, or in the EU country in which you reside.

**12\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

**Informal Negotiations**

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a ‘Dispute’ and collectively, the ‘Disputes’) brought by either you or us (individually, a ‘Party’ and collectively, the ‘Parties’), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

**Binding Arbitration**

Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these Legal Terms shall be determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the application for arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom. The language of the proceedings shall be English. Applicable rules of substantive law shall be the law of the United Kingdom.

**Restrictions**

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

**13\. CORRECTIONS**
