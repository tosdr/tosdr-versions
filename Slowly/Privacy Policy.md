Privacy Policy
--------------

SLOWLY is owned and operated by Slowly Communications Limited. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://slowly.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

By downloading or using SLOWLY you agree to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

If you are under the age of 12, you may not download or use SLOWLY. We do not knowingly collect or maintain information from children under age 12. If you are between the ages of 12 and 17, you must get your parent or guardian to read and agree to our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

**1\. What This Privacy Policy Covers**

This Privacy Policy describes how our mobile applications, websites and products collect, store, use, and share your personal information. It also describes how you can control and protect your privacy on our Service.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, such as companies that advertise on our Service. For example, companies that advertise on our Service may tag your device or computer with cookies. We do not control these third party cookies and their privacy policies may differ from ours.

**2\. Controlling and Protecting Your Privacy**

Personal Safety:

After getting to know someone online, you may choose to meet him or her in-person. If so, be careful and use common sense. Never meet someone in private for the first time; choose a public place, and take a friend.

Account Settings:

You can change your account settings at any time, including how you share your location information with other users. You should review these settings regularly.

Deleting Your Account:

You can delete your Account at any time by going to the ‘Settings’ page when you are logged in and clicking on the ‘Remove Account’’ link. Your Account will be deactivated immediately but it may take a little while for Your Content (defined below) to be completely removed from the App. We will save your profile information in case you decide to restore your Account (which you can do within 30 days of deactivating your Account). We reserve the right at our sole discretion to terminate or suspend any Account, or make use of any operational, technological, legal or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses), at any time without liability and without the need to give you prior notice.

Deleting Your Information and Content:

If you are under the age of 18, you can request us to delete your posted information and content. To do so, send an email to [\[email protected\]](https://slowly.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the account information, including nickname and login information associated with your SLOWLY account requesting deletion. We make reasonable efforts to comply, but we cannot guarantee we will be able to delete all of your information everywhere from our systems.

Location Information:

We collect your geolocation when you first register with Slowly, if you grant us permission to do so. We do not “track” your location, but we do collect location information from your device or browser when you log in or use Slowly, such as when you visit a particular feature that uses location (such as unlocking location-based stamps). To protect your privacy and security, we do not share your precise location with other users. Your geo-location showed by your account is randomly shifted for protection. We may still use your location (such as for security or advertising purposes) even if you choose not to display it to other users.
