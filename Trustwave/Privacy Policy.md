### 1.1  Introduction

Trustwave Holdings, Inc., a company incorporated in the United States whose registered office is at 70 W. Madison St., Suite 600, Chicago IL 60602, its parent company, and its subsidiaries (together “**Trustwave**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”), commits to maintaining the privacy, security, and accuracy of your personal data. As a result, Trustwave has developed this policy to inform you of the steps it has taken to protect your privacy. Trustwave complies with all applicable data protection laws, including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”), the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (“**DPA 2018**”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**”), and the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“**Privacy Act**”).

### 1.2  Scope of Policy

This policy covers personal data that may be transferred to and from Trustwave and its subsidiaries. More specifically, this policy covers personal data from European, American, and Australian residents that is collected or disclosed by Trustwave. Additional information on European, American (including Californian), and Australian residents’ rights under the GDPR, DPA 2018, CCPA and the Privacy Act may be found below. References to ‘personal data’ throughout this policy will have their meaning derived from the relevant terminology and definitions set forth by the applicable law. Trustwave respects your right to privacy and has implemented privacy practices in the provision of its services, products, and website, in accordance with the GDPR, the DPA 2018, the Australian Privacy Principles (“**APPs**”) and other applicable law.

In general, Trustwave may disclose your personal data with any member of the subsidiaries who may process your personal data for the purposes specified in this policy. The list of Trustwave companies with whom your data may be disclosed will change from time to time.

For individuals specifically located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, Trustwave will ensure that transfers of personal data to a third country are subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR. Trustwave commits to complying with the following data protection principles in respect of all personal data which is received from individuals based in the European Union, European Economic Area, or the United Kingdom and transferred to other Trustwave subsidiaries:

1. **Notice:** Trustwave is committed to providing you with information about the types of information that Trustwave may collect from you and how they are used, and your rights in relation to your personal data
2. **Choice:** Where possible, Trustwave will allow you to opt out of (i) disclosures of your personal data to third parties; or (ii) use of your personal data for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you;
3. **Accountability for Onward Transfers:** Trustwave will only transfer your personal data to third parties where: (i) such transfer is only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) the third party provides at least the same level of privacy protection as required under applicable law; (iii) the processing is consistent with Trustwave’s obligations under applicable law; (iv) the third party is required to notify Trustwave if it can no longer provide sufficient protection for your personal data; and (v) the third party takes steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing
4. **Security:** Trustwave will take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal data from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction;
5. **Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation:** Trustwave will take steps to limit the personal data that it processes about you to that which is relevant for the purposes of processing. Trustwave will also take steps to hold the data it processes about you for as long as it serves the purpose of processing. Trustwave will also take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current;
6. **Access:** You have a right to access the personal data that Trustwave holds about you and to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate; and
7. **Lawful Basis of Processing:** Trustwave will process personal data on the basis of consent, out of necessity for the performance of a contract, legitimate interests for marketing purposes, and to protect our legal position in the event of legal proceedings.

### 2.9   Rights of Data Subjects in Australia

Trustwave abides by the APPs, which provide a scheme in relation to the collection, disclosure, use, and storage of personal data.

**Collection of Personal Data.** Where lawful and practicable (i.e., if we are still able to provide the relevant service or information to you without your information), you may choose to deal with Trustwave anonymously or under a pseudonym.

**International Transfer of Personal Data.** Generally, your personal data is likely to be stored in Australia. However, some Trustwave companies and service providers are located overseas, and in some instances, your personal data may be transferred to or processed by Trustwave companies and service providers in overseas countries.

If there is an international transfer of personal data (whether by disclosing it to such parties or merely by allowing them to access it) we will take appropriate steps to ensure that it is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and the AAPs. If you have any questions about the collection, use, disclosure, or storage of your personal data, please contact us using the details at the “_Contact Details_” section below.

**Access to your Personal Data.** You may request details related to the personal data that we hold about you in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act. If you would like a copy of the information which we hold about you or believe that any information we hold on you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, you may send a request to Trustwave in accordance with the “_Contact Details_” section below.

Additionally, if you have a complaint about our privacy practices, please submit the details of your complaint in accordance with the “_Contact Details_” section below. Please note that your complaint must be made in writing as required by section 40(1A) and that we will respond within a reasonable time as determined by the Privacy Act.

For more information on how to exercise your rights, please see Section 2.10 (_Exercising Your Privacy Rights_).

### 2.10  Exercising Your Privacy Rights

You will not be discriminated against in any way by exercising your rights listed in this policy, which means we will not deny products or services to you, provide different prices or rates for products or services to you, or provide a different level or quality of products or services to you.

To exercise any of the privacy rights afforded to you under applicable data protection law, please submit a request to us by one of the following methods:

* Calling us toll free at +1 (866) 659-9097
* Emailing us at [dataprotection@trustwave.com](mailto:dataprotection@trustwave.com)
* Submitting a request on our website [here](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/legal-documents/privacy-request/).

**_Verification_**. We must verify your identity before fulfilling your requests. If we cannot initially verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the verification process. We will only use personal data provided in a request to verify the requestor’s identity. If you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of a California consumer, we will also need to verify your identity, which may require proof of your written authorization or evidence of a power of attorney.  

We endeavor to respond to requests within the time period required by applicable law. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response to you electronically.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal data if we cannot verify your identity and confirm the personal data relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. 

We may deny certain requests, or only fulfill some in part, as permitted or required by law. For example, if you request to delete personal data, we may retain personal data that we need to retain for legal purposes.

**_Appeals_**. If you are not satisfied with the resolution of your request and you are afforded a right to appeal such decision, you will be notified of our appeal process in our response to your request.

### 2.11  Security

Trustwave utilizes appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and services protect your personal data. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal data we hold is protected from misuse, interference, and loss, and unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure using various methods, including secure storage.

### 2.12  Children’s Privacy

Trustwave does not knowingly collect or solicit any personal data from children under the age of 16. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child, we will promptly take steps to delete that information. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child has given us their personal data, you can contact us using the information listed in Section 3.

### 2.13  Considerations on Data Erasure

When processing a valid request for erasure of personal data in accordance with this policy and applicable law, Trustwave will promptly erase personal data from live systems based on the scope defined between the parties. Where data erasure applies to you, please also consider the following:

* Depending on the extent of your relationship with Trustwave, your data may be retained in Trustwave’s backup systems for a longer period of time in a format that is beyond use;
* Backup systems play a crucial role in Trustwave’s data security program and in ensuring the availability and access to data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;
* Data erasure on certain backup systems may not be immediately possible due to existing technical controls designed to keep information temporarily available to Trustwave’s information technology team solely when fully required in the event of a physical or technical incident;
* Relevant data retained in certain backup systems will not be used for any other purpose and will be secured with the appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the requirements of data protection law; and
* Relevant data retained in backup systems will be kept until such data is overwritten and completely erased based on Trustwave’s internal backup retention schedule and policies.

Trustwave will provide you with more information on a case-by-case basis.

### 2.14  Links to Third-Party Websites

Trustwave is not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our website, including the information or content contained within them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing personal data to third parties, since any personal data disclosed will be subject to the applicable third party’s privacy policy.

### 2.15  Changes

Trustwave may amend this policy from time to time. If Trustwave makes any amendments, we will post a notice on our website.
