You agree to pay Vana the amount during the checkout process in accordance with the terms of such plan and these Terms of Service.  If you dispute any charges you must let Vana know within sixty (60) days after the date that Vana charges you, or within such longer period of time as may be required under applicable law.  We reserve the right to change Vana’s prices. If Vana does change prices, Vana will provide notice of the change through the Service user interface, a pop-up notice, email, or through other reasonable means, at Vana’s option, at least thirty (30) days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You will be responsible for all taxes associated with the Service, other than taxes based on Vana’s net income.

**Payment Processing:** Notwithstanding any amounts owed to Vana hereunder, VANA DOES NOT DIRECTLY PROCESS PAYMENT FOR ANY SERVICES. To facilitate payment for the Service, we may use Giftbit and its affiliates (“**Giftbit**”), Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates (“**Stripe**”) or other third-party payment processors (collectively, “**Payment Processors**”).

By agreeing to these Terms of Service, users that use the payment functions of the Service also agree to be bound by the Giftbit Agreements, Stripe Agreements and/or applicable Payment Processor Agreement for the payment function the user is using, as the same may be modified by Giftbit, Stripe and/or the applicable Payment Processor from time to time. You hereby authorize Giftbit. Stripe and/or the applicable Payment Processor to store and continue billing your specified payment method, if it is provided to them, even after such payment method has expired, to avoid, to the extent applicable, interruptions in your use of the Service. Please contact Giftbit, Stripe and/or the applicable Payment Processor for more information. Vana assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments processed through the Service.

Vana will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“**DMCA**”) and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Vana’s Copyright Agent at [legal@vana.com](mailto:legal@vana.com) (Subject line: “**DMCA Takedown Request**”). You may also contact the Copyright Agent by mail or facsimile at:

**_Counter-Notice_**: If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

* Your physical or electronic signature;
* Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

    ‍

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Vana will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing them that Vana may replace the removed content or cease disabling it within ten (10) business days. Unless the owner of the applicable copyrighted work or other intellectual property files an action seeking a court order against Vana or the user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.

**_Repeat Infringer Policy_**: In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Vana has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Vana’s sole discretion, the Accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.

**Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

1. **Agreement to Arbitrate**

This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms of Service as the “**Arbitration Agreement**.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Vana, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Vana are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

1. **Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief**

**_YOU AND VANA AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND VANA AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION._**

1. **Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution**

Vana is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at [support@vana.com](mailto:support@vana.com). If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“**Notice**”). The Notice to Vana should be sent to Attn: Legal, Corsali, Inc. dba Vana, 548 Market St, PMB 77861, San Francisco, CA 94104 (“**Notice Address**”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Vana and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Vana may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Vana or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Vana is entitled.

1. **Arbitration Procedures**

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“**AAA**”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “**AAA Rules**”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, [https://www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, [https://www.adr.org/consumer](https://www.adr.org/consumer). If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

Unless Vana and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Vana agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

1. **Costs of Arbitration**

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “**Arbitration Fees**”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.  To the extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either Vana or you under the AAA Rules, Vana and you shall split them equally; _provided_ that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, Vana will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Vana will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

1. **Confidentiality**

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, must be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

1. **Severability**

If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue to apply.

1. **Future Changes to the Arbitration Agreement**

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, Vana agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Vana written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).

**Termination**

Vana reserves the right to monitor the Sites, Service, and Platform for violations of the Terms of Service.  You agree that Vana, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your Account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including for lack of use or if Vana believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Vana may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Vana may immediately deactivate or delete your Account and all related information and files in your Account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Vana will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.  If Vana terminates or suspends your Account for a violation of these Terms of Service, you may not register a new Account under your name, any other name, or a third party, even if you are acting on a third party's behalf.

**User Disputes**

You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service, and Vana will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Vana reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.

**General**

These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Vana governing your access and use of the Service, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Vana with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Vana submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the County of San Francisco, California. The failure of Vana to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Vana, but Vana may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in these Terms of Service, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service. Vana will not be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic, hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical power, network access or equipment, or any other circumstances or causes beyond Vana’s reasonable control.
