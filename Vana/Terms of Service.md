The first network for user-owned data
=====================================

We believe in an open internet where users own their data and the AI models they contribute to.

AI models should be created more like open source software: iteratively by a community. To make this possible, researchers need access to the world's best datasets that are held captive across walled gardens. Users can break down these walled gardens by exporting their own data. 

We are building towards a user-owned foundation model, trained by 100M users who contribute their data and compute.
