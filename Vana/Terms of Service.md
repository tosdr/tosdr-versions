==================

Effective Date: November 15th, 2024

Welcome to the Terms of Service for vana.org, the website-hosted user interface for the Vana Network (the “**DataHub**”), and vanascan.io, the block explorer of the Vana Network ("**Block Explorer**").  For the purposes of these terms, the “**Vana Network**” means the web3 Vana protocol and related open-source smart contracts which enable a decentralized network for user-owned data.

The Vana Foundation (“**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) provides the DataHub and Block Explorer in order to facilitate and support interactions within the decentralised ecosystem of the Vana Network, including interactions between data liquidity pools ("**DLPs**”), data contributors, data consumers, decentralised autonomous organisations (**"DAOs**"), developers, users and third parties.  The DataHub, Block Explorer, [vana.org](http://vana.org/), and any content, tools, documentation, features and functionality offered on or through these interfaces are collectively referred to as the “**Services**”.

All access and use of the Service is subject to the terms and conditions contained in these Terms of Service (as amended from time to time, the “**Terms of Service**”). By accessing or otherwise using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not accept the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, you will not access, browse, or otherwise use the Service. 

For purposes of these Terms, “**you**” and “**your**” means you as the user of the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of a company or other entity then “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these Terms of Service were last revised. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. You should periodically visit this page to review the current Terms of Service, so you are aware of any revisions. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms of Service, you will not access, browse, or use (or continue to access, browse, or use) the Service.

**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS.

You agree that, by agreeing to the Terms of Service, we both are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator as stipulated in this Arbitration Agreement, not a judge or jury. 
2. **Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.** YOU AND US AGREE THAT EACH OF YOU AND US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND US AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
3. **Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.** We are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user’s satisfaction by emailing support at [support@vanafoundation.org](mailto:support@vanafoundation.org). If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“**Notice**”). The Notice to us should be sent to [legal@vanafoundation.org](mailto:legal@vanafoundation.org) (“**Notice Address**”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If you and us do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or us may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or us is entitled. 
4. **Arbitration Procedures.** After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “**Claim**”) relating in any way to the Services, including the DataHub, any use or access or lack of access thereto, and any other usage of the Vana Network even if interacted with outside of the Services or DataHub, will be resolved by arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim.  You and the Company agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the London Court of International Arbitration in accordance with the LCIA Rules then in effect ("**LCIA Rules**"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.   The Arbitration shall be conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the LCIA Rules.  The arbitrator shall possess expertise in commercial law and, where applicable, technology-related disputes.  If there is any inconsistency between any term of the LCIA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of the Terms of Service as a court would.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless we both agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the seat of arbitration shall be the Cayman Islands.
5. **Costs of Arbitration.** Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “**Arbitration Fees**”) will be governed by the LCIA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, then, at your request, we will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, we will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. 
6. **Legal Fees**.  Each party shall bear its own legal fees and costs (including attorneys' fees) unless the arbitrator, at their discretion, determines that such fees and costs should be awarded to the prevailing party. 
7. **Confidentiality**. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
8. **Severability.** If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than subsection ‎10.2, titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”, above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection ‎10.2 are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply. 
9. **Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement.**  Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms of Service to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Terms of Service).
10. **Exceptions.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and the Foundation agree that the following types of disputes will be resolved in a court of proper jurisdiction:  (i) disputes or claims where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief (including public injunctive relief); or (ii) intellectual property disputes.

11. **MISCELLANEOUS**
    1. **Entire Agreement.** These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Terms of Service supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings (if any) relating to the subject matter of the terms.
    2. **Governing Law.** These Terms of Service and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes not subject to arbitration will be in the Cayman Islands and you and us each waive any objection to such jurisdiction and venue.
    3. **Assignment.** You may not assign or transfer the Terms of Service, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer the Terms of Service without our prior written consent shall be null and void. We may freely assign or transfer the Terms of Service. Subject to the foregoing, the Terms of Service will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
    4. **Notice.** We may provide any notice to you under the Terms of Service using commercially reasonable means, including using public communication channels. Notices we provide by using public communication channels will be effective upon posting. Notices to us must be sent via email, to [support@vanafoundation.org](mailto:support@vanafoundation.org), or via post, to Vana Foundation, c/o Highvern Cayman Limited, Second Floor, Elgin Court, Elgin Avenue, PO Box 448, Grand Cayman, KY1-1106, Cayman Islands.
    5. **Severability.** If any provision of the Terms of Service shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of the Terms of Service shall not be affected.
    6. **Force Majeure.** We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of our obligations under these Terms or in providing the Services, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from any events beyond our ability to control, including acts of God; flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, pandemics, tsunami, explosion, war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, government order, law, or action, embargoes or blockades, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, shortage of adequate or suitable Internet connectivity, telecommunication breakdown or shortage of adequate power or electricity, and other similar events beyond our control.
    7. **No Waiver.** Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of the Foundation. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Service, the exercise by either you or us of any of its remedies under these Terms of Service will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Service or otherwise.
12. **QUESTIONS, COMPLAINTS, CLAIMS.**‍
