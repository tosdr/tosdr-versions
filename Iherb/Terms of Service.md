### iHerb Rewards Program

The Rewards Program is on-going and participation is subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

Eligibility

The Rewards Program is open to all iHerb account holders who are at least eighteen (18) years of age or older at the time of participation. Purchases made through the guest checkout feature are not eligible for Rewards Program participation or benefits. This Rewards Program is void where prohibited or restricted by law. Your participation in the Rewards Program and use of Your Rewards Link and Rewards Code (as each is defined below), constitutes your full and unconditional agreement to the terms set forth in this Agreement, and iHerb’s decisions and interpretations, which are final and binding in all matters related to the Rewards Program. If you are a business or publisher (including but not limited to coupon sites, deal sites, cashback sites, content sites, online shopping comparison tool, etc.), please refer to iHerb Affiliate Program terms below for more information on eligibility and terms of use.

General Rewards Program Information

Subject to the above eligibility requirements, You may participate in the Rewards Program when You create a valid account on the Site. When You create a valid account, You will be enrolled in this Rewards Program and be deemed a participant in the Rewards Program in order to receive credits towards Your future iHerb purchases (“Rewards Credits”).

Rewards Credits earned under this Rewards Program from making referral and writing review can only be used by You towards Your future purchases made on the Site (see [Rewards FAQs](https://secure.iherb.com/info/rewardsfaq).) As discussed further below, Rewards Credits are not redeemable for cash.

Once enrolled, You will receive a customized link (“Rewards Link”) as well as a special code (“Rewards Code”). Both the Rewards Link and Rewards Code will be associated with Your account.

You can receive Rewards Credits when new and existing customers that You refer to iHerb (“Referred Customer”) place qualifying orders using Your Rewards Link or Rewards Code.

You may also earn rewards by posting eligible reviews.

Additionally, iHerb may, on occasion, run contests, sweepstakes, or promotions by which You may earn Promotional Rewards Credits. Promotional Rewards Credits are different from Rewards Credits and subject to additional use restrictions which are detailed below.

**Earning Rewards Credits**

You can refer potential Referred Customers through Your Rewards Link by:

1. Going to your favorite product, category page, or creating a shopping cart of Your favorite products. Next, click on the “Share” button on the top-right corner to share your Rewards Link, or
2. Going to Your order history and clicking on the “Share” button for each order to share with others.

You may also earn Rewards Credits if a Referred Customer enters Your Rewards Code at checkout.

Once a Referred Customer clicks on Your Rewards Link, they will have seven (7) days to complete their order. You can earn Rewards Credits for qualifying orders that will be applied to Your account in accordance with the Rewards Program Accounting and Payment Information section listed below.

Give 5% or more discount, and earn 5% or more in Rewards Credit from each referral order placed by a new or existing customer. You may also earn an additional percentage or dollar credit in the event that iHerb, at its sole discretion, decides to run a special promotional program from time to time. [Super Rewards](https://secure.iherb.com/rewards/superrewards) is considered one of the special promotional programs we run periodically, giving You additional opportunity to earn even more Rewards Credit. Check our [Super Rewards](https://secure.iherb.com/rewards/superrewards) page for the latest offer.

You may also earn Rewards Credits by writing reviews for products that You have purchased and used any time after July 1, 2020. iHerb’s offer of Rewards Credits to customers who post reviews is intended to encourage customers to provide authentic, transparent, and honest opinions, both positive and negative, based on their real experiences with products.

**Earning Promotional Rewards Credits**

iHerb may, on occasion, run contests, sweepstakes, or promotions by which You may earn Promotional Rewards Credits subject to the terms and conditions of those contests, sweepstakes or promotions. Promotional Rewards Credits are different from Rewards Credits and subject to additional use restrictions which are detailed below.

**Eligible Reviews**

To be eligible to receive Rewards Credits Your review must meet the following criteria: (i) You must have previously purchased the product from iHerb; (ii) Your purchase must have occurred after July 1, 2020; and (iii) Your review must comply with iHerb’s [User Generated Content Guidelines](https://www.iherb.com/ugc/terms) (“UGC Guidelines”). Deliberately fake content, copied or stolen content, off-topic reviews, defamatory language, personal attacks, and unnecessary or incorrect content are all in violation of our UGC Guidelines.

**Earning Rewards for Eligible Reviews**

You may receive a $1.00 (one dollar) Reward Credit as pending Rewards Credit for each approved and eligible review You submit whether that review is positive or negative. Approval of the review and payout of the Rewards will be instantly made available after you submit each review. You may only post one review per product. You can find more information about reviews and Rewards Credits in the FAQ’s.

**Voting Eligibility**

Any iHerb customer who has made at least one purchase from iHerb is eligible to vote on a review as helpful or unhelpful. Helpful or unhelpful votes are made by clicking on the thumbs up (for helpful) or thumb down (for unhelpful) icons found to the right of each review.

What Rewards Credits Can Be Used For

Your Rewards Credits will automatically apply to Your future orders and will appear in Your shopping cart when signing into Your iHerb account.

Subject to the below restrictions, there are no limitations to the amount of Rewards Credits that you can receive. However, You may use only one account per person and no more than five (5) customer accounts per household can participate in this Rewards Program.

iHerb will track orders that qualify under this Rewards Program and may make those tracked orders available to You for up to three (3) months.

For the purposes of determining the participant that will receive Rewards Credits for each qualifying Referred Customer order, iHerb will look to the Rewards Link or Rewards Code that was last used when finalizing such Referred Customer order.

What Promotional Rewards Credits Can Be Used For

Promotional Rewards Credit can only be used by You towards Your future purchases made on the Site. Promotional Rewards Credits may have varying expiration dates subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant contest, sweepstake, or promotion.

Rewards Program Accounting and Payment Information

The actual amount of any earned Rewards Credit referrals will be calculated based on the give 5% or more discount, and earn 5% or more in Rewards Credit from each referral order placed by a new or existing customer.

**Rewards Credits earned from referral purchases** will generally be posted to Your account within thirty-five (35) days following the qualifying transaction which is completed by a Referred Customer (“Pending Credit”). Promotional Rewards Credits will post to Your account based on the terms and conditions of the relevant contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. This time period is necessary to address any cancelled orders, returned products, cashback issues or other related issues. After the 35-day period referenced above for Rewards Credit earned through referral purchases, Pending Credits will be available in Your account to be applied to future purchases (“Available Credit”).

**Any Rewards Credits earned will be posted to Your account as immediately available for use**

Rewards Credits are incentives for future purchases. As a condition to maintaining Rewards Credits, they must be used within ninety (90) days after posting to Your Account. Consequently, available Rewards Credits expire ninety (90) days after posting to Your account. However, 90-day expiration period resets when You earn new Rewards Credits during this time period.

**Promotional Rewards Credits** may have varying expiration dates subject to the specific terms and conditions of any contest, sweepstakes or promotion by which you may earn Promotional Rewards Credits. You will need to check the official rules of any contest, sweepstakes, or promotion for details.

Once an Available Credit has been used, that amount will be deducted from Your account (“Used Credit”).

Any Pending Credit or Available Credit may be adjusted accordingly in the event that a Referred Customer subsequently returns or refuses a previously placed order (“Cancelled Credit”), for technical errors, or corrections.

Rewards Credits Cash Out

After November 5, 2024, Rewards Credits can no longer be accrued for a cash out option. Rewards Credit cash out requests (for account with a minimum of $300 in Rewards Credits) will be honored if submitted prior to December 10, 2024.

iHerb partners with Hyperwallet (powered by PayPal) to cash out Rewards Credits. You may only cash out Rewards Credits if Hyperwallet supports your country. If Hyperwallet does not support your country, you are not eligible to cash out Rewards Credits. See the [Rewards FAQ](https://secure.iherb.com/info/rewardsfaq) for the list of countries that Hyperwallet currently supports. Payment will be delivered within fourteen (14) business days after the participant elects to cash out. No Rewards Credit cash out request will be honored after December 10, 2024.

Tax Information

Upon creating an account with iHerb’s partner, Hyperwallet (powered by PayPal), users will be asked to submit the appropriate tax form. If iHerb believes You are a Rewards Program participant from whom iHerb is obligated to obtain tax information and You do not provide this information upon request, iHerb reserves the right to withhold your Rewards Credits cash out until You provide this information or otherwise satisfy iHerb that You are not a person from whom iHerb is required to obtain tax information. For US citizens or residents, information about submitting tax information is also available on Hyperwallet (powered by PayPal).

If You are not a resident of the United States and You have not accrued any tax liability in the United States You are still responsible for paying any applicable taxes in your home country for any Rewards Credits You cash out. It is Your responsibility to determine what taxes apply to the payments You receive, and it is Your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

IHERB AND ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS OF ANY OF THEM (COLLECTIVELY, "IHERB ENTITIES") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE IHERB ENTITIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR PRODUCT DEFECT OR FAILURE, CLAIMS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NORMAL WEAR, PRODUCT MISUSE OR MODIFICATION, ABUSE, INCORRECT PRODUCT SELECTION AND NOT FOLLOWING PRINTED DIRECTIONS.
    
    IHERB ENTITIES MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SITE OR ANY PROGRAM WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THE SITE WILL BE TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SITE OR FROM ANY PROGRAM WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION OR OTHER MATERIAL OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SITE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND ANY SITE ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.

IN NEW JERSEY, THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY DOES NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY DUE TO INTENTIONAL OR RECKLESS CONDUCT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR VIOLATION OF A STATUTORILY IMPOSED DUTY ON THE PART OF IHERB.
    
116. Indemnification:

    You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless iHerb from and against all losses, expenses, costs and damages including attorney's fees resulting from your use or inability to use the Site, participation in any Program, products or services purchased or obtained by You in connection with the Site, any Site postings or activity related to your account made by You or another person, Your violation of any terms of this Agreement, Your violation of any rights of a third party, or Your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. You agree to cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any such claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you pursuant to his section, in which event you will still be required to indemnify us for the attorneys’ fees and expenses in addition to any losses, claims, damages and liabilities incurred by us as a result of this claim. You shall not in any event settle any matter without prior written consent of iHerb. In New Jersey, this indemnification provision does not apply to your liability resulting from intentional or reckless conduct, gross negligence, strict liability, negligence, or violation of a statutorily imposed duty on the part of iHerb.

    -----------------------------------------------------
    
    You acknowledge that this Site and all materials on the Site or provided in connection with the Programs, including without limitation the Site’s or Programs design, text, graphics, sounds, pictures, software and other files, its look and feel, and the selection and arrangement thereof, (collectively, "Materials"), are our property and are subject to and protected by United States and international copyright or other intellectual property laws and rights.

118. Agreement:
    ----------
    
    This Agreement constitutes the only Agreement between us and you with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous Agreements, representations, warranties and understandings, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
    
119. Severability; Interpretation
    ----------------------------
    
    If any provision of this Agreement is deemed void, unlawful, or otherwise unenforceable for any reason, that provision will be severed from this Agreement and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in force. When used in this Agreement, the term "including" will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation".
    
120. Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Individual Arbitration; Waiver of Jury Trial; and Class Waiver:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law.
    
    iHerb and You (collectively the “Parties” and individually a “Party”) further agree that the following agreement to arbitrate is part of an agreement made in interstate commerce and is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, and that on questions of the constructive, validity, enforcement, or interpretation of the agreement to arbitrate, the FAA shall control. You and iHerb Entities agree to arbitrate, on an individual basis, any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement, including but not limited to claims based on contract, tort, negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions. It is expressly intended that the iHerb shall have the ability to enforce this arbitration agreement. **EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP (WAIVING) ITS RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.**
    
    YOU AND IHERB ENTITIES EXPRESSLY AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALSO APPLIES TO THRESHOLD ARBITRABILITY ISSUES, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATED TO WHETHER THE AGREEMENT IS UNCONSCIONABLE OR ILLUSORY AND ANY DEFENSE TO ARBITRATION.
    
    **THE PARTIES ALSO AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN YOUR AND OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, NOT AS A CLASS, PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.** THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. IF ANY PORTION OF THIS CLASS WAIVER PROVISION IS HELD INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, IT SHALL NOT BE SEVERED, AND THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION SHALL BE UNENFORCEABLE.
    
    The mutual promise by you and iHerb Entities to arbitrate these disputes, and to do so on an individual basis, rather than to litigate before the courts or other bodies, provides the mutual consideration for this agreement to arbitrate.
    
    Either Party may exercise the right to arbitrate by providing the other Party with written notice of any and all claims forming the basis of such right in sufficient detail to inform the other Party of the substance of such claims, and a demand to arbitrate those claims. In no event shall the request for arbitration be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claims would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
    
    Unless you and iHerb otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside by a single neutral arbitrator agreed to by the Parties or, if one cannot be agreed upon, pursuant to the then-current American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”)\_Consumer Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be in accordance with the then- current AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (available online at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/).) or, if those rules are no longer available, the applicable rules selected by the arbitrator; provided, however, that no rules permitting class, collective, or other representative arbitrations shall be used. In the event of any conflict between this agreement to arbitrate and the rules governing the arbitration, the terms of this agreement to arbitrate shall control.
    
    The Parties are entitled to representation by an attorney or other representative of their choosing, and at their own costs. Each Party shall pay its own attorney fees. The parties agree to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator; provided, however, that the arbitrator shall not have the authority to award punitive or exemplary damages or to issue injunctive or other equitable relief. The arbitrator shall issue the award in writing and therein state the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
    
    Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
    
121. Miscellaneous:
    --------------
    
    You may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Subject to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. iHerb may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without Your consent or the consent of any other person. For the avoidance of doubt, any Rewards Credits eligible for a cash out option prior to December 10, 2024 as provided above may be transferred to iHerb Rewards, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company, on or prior to such date, which entity shall be solely responsible for payment of any properly exercised cash out option.
    
    The failure of iHerb to enforce your strict performance of any term of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such term and will not be considered a waiver or limit that party's right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to the use of the Site or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or such claim or cause of action will be permanently barred. The "Liability Disclaimer" provisions of this Agreement are for the benefit of iHerb Entities as defined herein, and each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce these provisions directly against your on its own behalf.
