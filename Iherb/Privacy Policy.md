We may combine information we obtain about you through our websites with the information obtained through our apps for the purposes described above. We also may use the information we obtain in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection or otherwise with your consent.

Automated Collection Of Data
----------------------------

When you use our Services or open our emails, we may obtain certain information by automated means, such as browser cookies, Flash cookies, local storage, web beacons and pixels, JavaScript, device identifiers, server logs and other technologies. The information we obtain in this manner may include your device IP address, domain name, identifiers associated with your devices, device and operating system type and characteristics, web browser characteristics, language preferences, clickstream data, your interactions with our Services (such as the web pages you visit, links you click and features you use), the pages that led or referred you to our Services, dates and times of access to our Services, and other information about your use of our Services. We also may receive your device’s geolocation and other information related to your location through GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi signals and other technologies for certain purposes listed above, such as to provide you with our Services. Your device may provide you with a notification when the Services attempt to collect your precise geolocation.

A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. Cookies may be set either directly by the website a user is visiting (“first-party cookies”), or by a domain other than the website the user is visiting (“third-party cookies”). A “Flash cookie,” also known as a local shared object, functions like a web cookie to personalize a user’s experience on sites that use Adobe Flash Player. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. We and our third-party service providers may use beacons in emails to help us track response rates, identify when our emails are accessed or forwarded, and for other purposes listed above.

The following types of cookies and similar technologies are used on the Services:

_Necessary Cookies_
-------------------

We use necessary cookies to help enable the Services to function, including to (1) identify you once you have logged in to your account, (2) keep track of preferences you specify while you use the Services, and (3) manage the security of the Services.

_Functionality Cookies_
-----------------------

Our Services also use cookies to personalize the content of the Services based on your use of the Services, and support certain third-party services to provide enhanced functionality, such as to enable videos posted on the Services from YouTube. These features use third-party cookies (e.g., You Tube cookies) that are placed directly on your device by the third-party services. The privacy practices of these third parties, including details on the information they may collect about you, are subject to the privacy notices of these parties, which we strongly suggest you review.

_Analytics Cookies_
-------------------

Through our Services, we may obtain personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party apps, websites, devices and other online services. On our Services, we use third-party online analytics services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services use automated technologies to collect data (such as email address, IP addresses, cookies and other device identifiers) to evaluate, for example, use of our Services and to diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit [http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy), and to opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites, please visit: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). In addition, our Services use FullStory analytics cookies and similar technologies (local storage) to collect technical information from your device (such as IP address, device and operating system type, browser and approximate geographic location based on your device IP address), as well as information about your interactions with our Services (such as clickstream, browsing and keystroke data, and the referring URL and session duration). This information allows us to recreate your sessions so we can get a better understanding of how you use our Services, troubleshoot issues, and administer and improve our Services.

_Personalized Advertising Cookies_
----------------------------------

Through our Services, both we and certain third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests and browsing context. These networks track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, server logs, web beacons and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing and app usage activities. The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users’ visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

* [Microsoft Edge](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)
* [Microsoft Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)

To find out how to manage cookies for other browsers, please click “help” on your browser’s menu or visit www.allaboutcookies.org. \[Flash cookies typically cannot be controlled, deleted or disabled through your browser settings and instead must be managed through your Adobe Flash Player settings. To manage Flash cookies, which we may use on our website from time to time, you can go to the Adobe Flash Player Support page available here. In addition, your mobile device settings may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with app developers and operators such as us. Our Services are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers. Please note that without cookies or other automated tools we use to collect this type of data, you may not be able to use all the features of our Services.

_Chatbot Logs_
--------------

Our Services also use a chatbot to provide automated customer assistance. A chatbot is a computer program that communicates with you, using text on a digital message interface and artificial intelligence. Put simply, if you ask a question through our chatbot, the chatbot will reply to you in human-ish behavior. Our chatbot is supported by Ada Support, a third-party chatbot service provider located in Canada, who performs services on our behalf (“Ada”). Ada uses an automated decision making process, when deciding on the correct answer to serve based on your question, and will receive message logs and usernames when you interact with the chatbot. Message logs contain information such as details of your account with us, including your username, e-mail address, phone number and address, as well as any other content you choose to submit when you make a customer support inquiry through the chatbot. Ada will retain the content of those messages, together with responses to those messages and any outcome from those messages. This information will be retained for twelve (12) months and will be used only to provide customer support and improve the quality of the chatbot services. If you are located in the EEA, UK or Switzerland, the above information will be transferred to Ada in Canada - a country which has been recognized by the European Commission, UK and Swiss Administration as providing an adequate level of data protection.

Information Sharing
-------------------

We do not disclose personal information we obtain about you, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will share your personal information with our (1) subsidiaries and affiliates, and (2) third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (such as website hosting, payment processing and authorization, order fulfillment, transportation, customs clearance, marketing, data analytics, customer support and fraud prevention) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We do not authorize our service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.

We also may disclose information about you: (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (2) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (3) to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; (4) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm or financial loss; (5) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; (6) in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation); or (7) otherwise with your consent.

Data Transfers
--------------

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your information to recipients in other countries (such as the U.S.), we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy and will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in countries other than the one in which you provided the information, including by selecting service providers that are located in a country recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection or by implementing appropriate safeguards based on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, where applicable. Subject to applicable law, you may obtain a copy of these safeguards by contacting us as indicated in the [How to Contact Us](#contact) section below.

**Verifying Requests:** To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request. If you have an account with us, we verify your identity by requiring you to sign in to your account. If you do not have an account with us and you request access to or deletion of your personal information, there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by the CCPA. The reason for this is that iHerb historically has not linked IP addresses, device identifiers or other information collected by automated means to named actual persons. Accordingly, if you do not have an account with us, and you request access to or deletion of your personal information, we will not be able to process your request at this time.

**Additional Information:** If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.

For questions or concerns about our privacy policies and practices, please contact us as described in the [How To Contact Us](https://www.iherb.com/info/privacy) section of our Privacy Policy.
