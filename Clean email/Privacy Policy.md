Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
===================================

Last updated on Nov 5, 2024

Privacy Policy
--------------

This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect your personal information. You accepted this policy when you signed up for our Service. We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. Should a revision prove unacceptable to you, please contact us at support@clean.email.

Our Commitment To Privacy
-------------------------

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. It represents our good-faith efforts to ensure your privacy and provide you with a great service.

The Information We Collect
--------------------------

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Clean Email. The types of personal information collected includes but is not limited to:

* Email address
* For third party mail providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, AOL) we may have to store authorization credentials and related information for other sites. We will make it clear that we are requesting this information before you provide it and you can contact to have it removed.
* Data you give us permission to access (e.g., your Emails, Profile)

We only access the envelope and header information associated with your emails. The actual bodies of your emails are never downloaded or accessed within our computer systems.

The Way We Use Information
--------------------------

We use your email address to communicate with you and to authenticate with 3rd party products integrated with our system. We will never sell or rent your email address or ANY personally identifiable or even aggregated information to another company.

For diagnostic purposes, our engineers may have access to private data (e.g., to fix a problem with the service). Before gaining such access, however, they must get management approval, and we are committed to maintaining the privacy of that data. Regardless, we will not read the bodies of your email messages (we may have to look at the envelopes (To/From/Subject/Date) as part of our diagnosis, but we ignore the bodies of messages).

We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website.

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in order to track authentication and other session information. These cookies are not shared with other sites and are not related to any marketing activities.

All personally identifiable information gathered can be disclosed to judicial or other government agencies subject to warrants, subpoenas or other governmental orders. But absent a legal compulsion, we will not divulge your information.

Finally, we do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above.

Additional Limits on Use of Your Google User Data
-------------------------------------------------

Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, if you provide Clean Email access to your Google data, Clean Email’s use of that data will be subject to these additional restrictions:

* Clean Email will only use access to read or control Gmail message metadata (including information about attachments), headers to provide a web service that allows users to process (delete/move/archive) emails and will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
* Clean Email will not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements.
* Clean Email will not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law, or for Clean Email’s internal operations and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized.
* Clean Email use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.

Our Commitment To Data Security
-------------------------------

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

All payments and payment information on our site is handled through FastSpring which is fully PCI DSS compliant. PCI DSS is the global standard for safeguarding financial transaction data. Payments for iOS mobile apps are charged to your "iTunes Account" at confirmation of purchase. No customer financial information is ever stored within our computer systems.

Our Commitment To Children's Privacy
------------------------------------

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

Who Owns Your Data?
-------------------

You own the data associated with your account. And, at any time, you can securely remove your data from our servers by using a feature in the application or contacting our support and requesting such a deletion. This will be true even during a corporate merger or a corporate bankruptcy.

Data Retention
--------------

When you cancel your membership, your account will remain active for the time your subscription was paid for unless otherwise requested. All cancelled subscriptions are automatically deactivated at the end of the paid period and they will revert to free accounts status.

All the data indexed for your email is automatically deleted from our servers 45 days after your last login to the service as long as there is no active subscription running.

If for any reason, we decide to close Clean Email, all users will be contacted by email and their account information will be securely deleted from our servers in a timely manner.

Subscription Fees
-----------------

You shall pay for all subscription fees, and hereby authorize Clean Email (and its payment processors) to debit your bank account or charge your credit card. **You agree that all subscription plans are recurring and will be renewed automatically.**

Cancellation Policy
-------------------

You acknowledge that all subscription fees are charged automatically on a recurring basis **until you cancel your subscription (both month-to-month and annual plans).**

You have the right to cancel your subscription at any time by using a link to manage the subscription from the payment confirmation email sent to you after the purchase or by informing us about your decision by email at support@clean.email at least 2 business days before your subscription renewal date. Please keep in mind that **you are solely responsible for properly canceling your account.** Make sure you tell us your name and email used for the purchase. We will not be able to find your subscription if we don't have the correct details. Your access to the service will still be available until the end of the period you paid for.

Refunds
-------

Clean Email offers a free limited trial to anyone who wants to check out the service before committing to a paid subscription.

For clients who purchased the subscription without using the trial Clean Email can issue a refund for the service within 30 days of the original purchase date of the product under certain conditions:

* You are unable to access the service (your email service is not supported)
* You asked for a refund within 7 days of your purchase without using the service. This also applies to rebills (e.g.: you have been billed but did not use the service)

**The chosen subscription is billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis and is non-refundable; no refunds will be issued unless otherwise required by law**. Clean Email does not offer prorated refunds for canceled subscription plans. **All subscription plans are recurring** and will be automatically renewed after the end of each paid subscription period. This includes both month-to-month and annual plans.

Clean Email does not provide refunds or credits for any term prepaid by you and you will not receive any refund for any unused days of any periodic subscription term unless otherwise required by law. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

To avoid abuses of the service no refunds will be given to repeated purchases (users who purchased in the past and canceled) and for rebills where a proper cancellation request was not made at least 2 business days before the charge.

We recommend contacting us for assistance if you experience any issues receiving or using our service.

Clean Email’s Refund Policy for Annual Plans
--------------------------------------------

Clean Email is committed to the success of our customers, but through experience we have found that users have varying requirements, capabilities, and limitations with regard to the types of devices and software they can use, the way their local network is configured, the speed of their internet connection, etc.

These issues may impact a customer’s ability to use Clean Email as it is intended.

Accordingly, Clean Email offers a Free Limited Trial, and is happy to extend the trial limit for users who need to better evaluate our services and its compatibility with their specific needs.

Clean Email also offers Month-to-Month Subscription Plans to allow customers to upgrade, downgrade, and cancel the subscription plan at any time without penalty. We recommend this option for most customers, especially those who do not have full certainty or control over their technology environment.

Finally, Clean Email offers an Annual Subscription Plan at a significant discount. **We recommend this plan for customers who are certain that Clean Email is compatible with their needs**. It is your responsibility to evaluate Clean Email, including its features, limitations, and system requirements before selecting the Annual Plan.

If you are not certain that Clean Email is a fit for your use case, then you should not choose the Annual Plan.

**Clean Email does not provide refunds to Annual Plans customers** on the basis of customers not understanding of the system requirements, or the presence of compatibility issues, including inadequate internet speed or consistency, or incompatible devices, operating systems, or browser software versions.

If you choose the Annual Plan, you are entering into a one-year subscription contract that expires 12 months after you sign up. You are responsible for paying for the entire subscription term. If you decide to cancel your subscription before the subscription term, then you will still be billed for the remaining months of your subscription, and you will still have access to the benefits of the service until the end of the term.
