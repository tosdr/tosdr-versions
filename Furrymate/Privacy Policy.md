This policy (together with our terms and conditions of use and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

We may collect and process the following information about you:

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve the Site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit.

You can amend your browser settings so that you do not accept cookies, but this will probably adversely affect the way you experience our Site.

Non-personal data may be gathered on our behalf using cookies, log file data, and code that is embedded on our websites by specific third party partners.
