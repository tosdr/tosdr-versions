Terms of Service - VPN.AC

TERMS OF SERVICE
================

Take a few minutes to read through our terms and policies pages. We take your trust seriously, and we encourage our customers to make sure they read through these pages and refer to them as necessary.

### GENERAL

VPN.AC (our site) and our VPN Service are both operated by Cryptolayer SRL (formerly Netsec Interactive Solutions SRL, hereafter referenced as "Cryptolayer", "we", "us" or "our"). Our company is registered in Sibiu, Romania.

550399, Sibiu, Romania  
Company Reg. Number: J32/500/2015  
VAT ID: RO34573525

By accessing this web site and/or using our VPN service, you are agreeing to be bound by our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. By using our VPN Service, you indicate that you accept the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use and that you agree to abide by them. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you should not use our service.

### PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

You may use our site and VPN services only for lawful purposes. Including, but not limited to the following, you may not use VPN Service to engage in the following activities:

* Send SPAM messages (both e-mail spam, bulk mail and web spam)
* Illegal or unauthorized access to other computers or networks (hacking activities)
* Scan ports or networks
* Distribute Internet viruses, worms, trojans, malware, rootkits or other destructive activities
* Launch DoS/DDoS attacks, attract DDoS against our VPN servers
* Participate in fraud and phishing activities
* Transmit child pornography materials
* Transmit any copyrighted, trademark, or patented content
* Promote or provide instructional information about terrorism or other illegal activities
* Use P2P programs on other VPN Nodes than those where we allow it
* Engage into any other illegal activities

We reserve the right to make changes to this list or define what we consider abuse. Check the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://vpn.ac/aup) for more details about the Prohibited Activities.

### BANDWIDTH USAGE

Bandwidth transfer is subject to fair usage policy. Excessive/abusive bandwidth consumption that may result in service disruption is not acceptable.

### SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the privileges of users who commit violations of our policies and service agreements. We will determine, in our discretion, whether there has been a breach of these terms through your use of our Site or VPN Service and suspend or terminate a user's account accordingly.

### ANTI-FRAUD

We take precautionary steps to prevent fraudulent sign-ups, by relying on automated checks or by doing manual checks. We will never ask for proof of identity, such as a scanned copy of a Government issued ID. Instead, we would rather decline an order which we believe to be suspicious.

### LOGGING

* We do not log any user activity, such as but not limited to sites you visit, DNS lookups, email messages, passwords, etc.
* We only log access to our VPN Service for troubleshooting, service improvement and security purposes.
* We log customer's IP address, VPN session connect and disconnect time, amount of traffic transferred. All these session logs are removed shortly after closing the session.
* We do not give your personal info to any third parties. We do not cooperate with any requests for information unless we are ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
* We value your privacy and we will do our best to protect it.

### PRICING / FEES TERMS

We reserve the right, with prior notice, to change the pricing of our VPN Service at any time.

### REFUNDS

We offer a 7-days money back guarantee. If you are not satisfied with our VPN service or you can't use our service for technical reasons, notify us within the first 7 days after your account activation/last payment, and you will be given a 100% refund of the paid amount.  
If a refund is due, you will be notified by e-mail. The refund process can take up to 15 days (usually less than a day) after cancellation of your account to receive your refund depending on payment form used. If you have not received your refund after 15 days, please inform us.  
We do not refund orders from users suspended for breaching our policies.  
No refunds (full or partial) are provided after the 7 days since last payment for any reasons.  
No refunds are provided for the reason of potentially changing a discount/voucher code.  
Refund requests must be based on valid reasons. We do not refund orders for vague reasons like "it doesn't work" without providing us details and letting us help. For example, if the customer doesn't use the correct VPN account credentials, first we need to make sure that the credentials are correct.  
Issuing a 2nd refund for any reason is not possible.  
Bitcoin refunds are made in Bitcoin, not the USD/EUR/GBP/other currency equivalent. For example, if you paid 0.005 BTC and you ask for a refund after a few days, you will receive 0.005 BTC back. The obvious reason for doing so is to protect both you and us from BTC's massive volatility, as well as discouraging speculative signups & refund requests.  
Not all payment instruments can be refunded! If you pay using a payment method that can't be refunded, we will only be able to refund using PayPal, Bitcoin.  

### OUR LIABILITY

We do our best to keep the VPN Service up and running, providing high data transfer speeds to all customers, but we can't guarantee it.  
Therefore, our VPN Service is provided "as is" without any guarantees, conditions or warranties as to its quality or suitability for any particular purpose.  
In no event shall VPN.AC or its hosting partners and/or affiliates be liable for any damages including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption arising out of the use or inability to use our VPN Service and website, even if VPN.AC or a VPN.AC's partner has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.  
  
WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR OUR USERS ACTIVITY.
