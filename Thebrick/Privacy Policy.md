We also collect this information to process and track returns and credits and to help detect and prevent fraud and otherwise administer our loss prevention program.

When you make a purchase from us, we will ask you for your name, home address and phone number. For any online transaction we will also collect your email address. Although you are not required in every circumstance to give us this information to complete your purchase, should you choose not to provide it to us we will be impeded in assisting you if you have problems or concerns with your purchase in the future, particularly if you do not retain your sales invoice.

If you make a purchase using a Credit Card, we collect your name, billing address for the card, type of card, card number and card expiration date. We require this information in order to process your purchase.

If you are applying for a Credit Card, in addition to your name, address and phone number, and your email address if you provide it to us, we, on our own behalf and as agent for Flexiti or to such other financing provider we may refer you, collect additional personal information and/or financial information as required on the application form in order to process your application and for the purposes set out in this policy, the Credit Card application, the cardholder agreement for the Credit Card.

If you register in one of our programs or enter a contest or promotion, we collect your personal information to administer your participation in the program, contest or promotion.

If you make a claim pursuant to your credit insurance purchased through either Trans Global Life Insurance Company or Trans Global Insurance Company, we will collect and use your health information to process your claim.

We collect, use and disclose as little of your personal information as we can while still ensuring that we can fulfill our identified purposes. We never sell or trade your personal information to any person or organization outside of The Brick Group.

We may also capture your image with closed circuit cameras when you visit our stores to prevent and detect fraud and otherwise as part of our loss prevention program. We may require you to authenticate your identity for verification purposes.

We may get information about you from third-party business partners such as updated shipping information. We may also collect information about you from a friend or relative. If you refer someone to us, please ensure that you only submit contact information of individuals with whom you have a close personal or family relationship who would be interested in receiving communications from us or who have authorized you to share their contact information.
