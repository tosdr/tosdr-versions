Terms of Use
============

Welcome to TrialSearch (the Site), the patient information website of SubjectWell, Inc. (SubjectWell, we, or us). TrialSearch is the marketplace of clinical trials to find studies in your area and learn whether you can qualify for trial participation. We appreciate your commitment to clinical trials and finding better ways to prevent, diagnose or treat diseases and health problems.

While we can’t promise that you will qualify for any particular study, receive treatment or achieve any specific outcomes, we do provide potential access to a wide variety of clinical trials, including those that are currently seeking participants.

Please read these Terms carefully before using the Health Intelligence Services, and understand that qualifying for clinical trials is a multi-step process, so you will need to provide information both on a web form through the Site and over the phone to have a chance to qualify for any specific clinical research project.

By using the TrialSearch Services, you accept the terms and restrictions described in these Terms. If you do not agree to any of these terms, please do not use the Services, because you will be held to them. We sometimes change our Terms to accurately reflect our Services and practices and will post revised versions of our Terms on the Site. We last revised these Terms on May 27, 2020.

### Your Contact Information and Eligibility

We cannot contact you through the Site or complete your request for clinical trials information without your contact details and certain background information necessary to identify clinical trials that may be well-suited for you. By submitting your information through the Site, you understand that we will contact you directly (by phone, SMS text, email, or other method, depending on the information you provide and the options you choose on the Site) to complete the next steps of the qualification process to determine your eligibility for a clinical trial or for other health related services. By submitting your mobile phone number through the Site registration, you understand and agree that we may contact you using an auto-dialer, prerecorded or artificial voice message, or SMS text message to communicate about your request, eligibility or other matters related to the Services. You also understand that your mobile carrier may charge message or data fees and you can opt-out at any time by replying STOP. You do not have to opt-in to SMS text messages to use the Services. For more information regarding our text messaging, please contact us using the Contact Us information below. Any information submitted through the Site or our Services will be managed in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.trialsearch.com/privacy-policy).
