[View Cookies Policy](https://nieuwlandfeed.com/cookies-policy)

**Embedded content from other websites**

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

**1\. Contact Forms** – We keep contact form submissions for a 1 year period for customer service purposes, but we do not use the information submitted through them for marketing purposes.

**2\. Email Marketing Opt-In Forms** – All email marketing opt-in forms used on this site, such as popups, floating bars, inline-forms, and others, require explicit consent from users before adding them to our mailing list. This is done with either:

A checkbox that user has to click before opt-in; or,  
Requiring double-optin to your email list  
Information gathered is used strictly for that purpose for which it was intended. We do not share the information submitted on an opt-in form with any third parties.

Subscribers to email marketing my unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email.

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
