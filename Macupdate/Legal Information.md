### Do not sell my personal information

California residents have the right under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**”) to opt out of the “sale” of their personal information by a company governed by CCPA.

MacUpdate does not sell your personal information to anyone nor use your data as a business model.

However, we support CCPA by allowing California residents to opt out of any future sale of their personal information. If you would like to record your preference that we will not sell your data in the future, please [contact us](#anchor-about-us).

### Do-not-track requests

California residents visiting the Website may request that we do not automatically gather and track information about their online browsing movements across the Internet.

Such requests are typically made through web browser settings that control signals or other mechanisms that allow consumers to exercise choice regarding collecting personal data about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

We currently do not have the ability to honor these requests. We may modify this Privacy Notice as our abilities change.
