In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold or shared (as that term is defined in the CPRA) Personal Information.  In addition, if you are a California resident, we will not sell or share your Personal Information during any time period in which this Notice does not set forth instructions with respect to your “right to opt-out” of the sale and sharing of your Personal Information.

**Your Rights and Choices**  
If you are a California resident, the CPRA provides you with specific rights regarding your Personal Information.  This section describes your rights (and certain of our duties) under the CPRA and explains how to exercise those rights.  All rights and duties provided under the CPRA and described in this “Your Rights and Choices” section and the following “Non-Discrimination” section are only applicable to California residents. 

_General Duties_  
Under the CPRA, we have general duties that relate to your Personal Information.  For example, as further described in this Notice, and subject to certain exceptions, we must (a) allow you to access your Personal Information upon request, (b) delete your Personal Information upon request, (c) correct inaccurate Personal Information upon request, (d) not use Personal Information for purposes that are incompatible with the disclosed purpose for which such Personal Information was collected, (e) provide you information on how long we intend to retain your Personal Information, (f) not retaliate against you for exercising your rights relating to Personal Information and (g) implement reasonable security procedures and practices to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure or use. 

_Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights_  
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information.  Once we receive and confirm your Verified Request (as defined below), we will disclose to you:

1. all categories of Personal Information we have collected about you since January 1, 2022 (unless you request a more recent date);
2. all categories of sources from which we have collected Personal Information about you during the applicable time period;
3. our business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or disclosing, as applicable, such Personal Information;
4. the categories of third parties with whom we have shared any such Personal Information for a business purpose, organized in a list (which such list shall be separate from the list detailing the third parties to whom any such Personal Information was sold) that shows the categories of any such Personal Information we shared with each category of third party (or, if we have not shared any such Personal Information, we shall disclose the same);
5. the categories of third parties to whom we have sold any such Personal Information, organized in a list (which such list shall be separate from the list detailing the third parties to whom any such Personal Information was shared for a business purpose) that shows the categories of any such Personal Information sold to each category of third party (or, if we have not sold any such Personal Information, we shall disclose the same); and
6. the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you (also called a data portability request) during the applicable time period.

_Deletion Request Rights_   
You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.  Once we receive and confirm your Verified Request, we will remove (and direct our Service Providers to remove) such Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies. 

We may deny your deletion request to the extent that retaining the Personal Information is necessary for us or our Service Providers to: 

1. comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations;
2. comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, local, or other governmental authorities;

6. prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity;
7. engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, and meets certain other criteria;
8. identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or
9. perform internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your business relationship with us.

If it is necessary for us to retain certain information, we will inform you of the basis for such retention in response to your request.  

_Right to Correct_  
You have the right to request that we correct any Personal Information held about you by us that is inaccurate.  Once we receive and confirm your Verified Request (as defined below), we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any inaccurate Personal Information (and direct our Service Providers to correct such inaccurate Personal Information) and will inform you as to whether we have complied with your correction request.  

_Exercising Access, Data Portability, Deletion and Correction Rights_  
If you are a California resident, to exercise the access, data portability, deletion or correction rights described in this Notice, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us (a “Verified Request) by either: 

1. emailing us at californiahrprivacy@frontdoor.com or
2. calling us at (844) 932-2502.

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf (an “Authorized Agent”), may make a Verified Request related to your Personal Information.  To designate an Authorized Agent, please email us at californiahrprivacy@frontdoor.com or write us at: 

Legal Department  
Attention:  Privacy Coordinator  
Frontdoor, Inc.  
3400 Players Club Parkway, Suite 300  
Memphis, TN 38125

A Verified Request must describe your request with sufficient detail such that the Verified Request allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.  In addition, your Verified Request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the individual about whom we collected Personal Information or an Authorized Agent of such individual, which such verification may include:

1. residency verification;
2. verification of first name, last name, phone number, address, last four digits of social security number or email;
3. re-verification through phone, email or other communication mediums (in particular, if a request to delete is made online); and
4. with respect to Authorized Agents, (a) a signed authorization from you evidencing such designation and (b) verification of your identity in accordance with the verification methods applicable to other individuals.

We cannot respond to a request to provide you with, or delete, Personal Information if we cannot verify (a) your identity, (b) a purported agent’s identity or authority to make the request or (c) that the requested Personal Information relates to you.  If we deny your Verified Request, we will inform you and explain the basis for such denial in writing.

We will only use Personal Information provided in a Verified Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. 

_Response Timing and Format_  
We endeavor to respond to each Verified Request within forty-five (45) days of our receipt of such Verified Request (and we will confirm receipt of such Verified Request within ten (10) days of our receipt thereof).  If we require more time (up to an additional forty-five (45) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.  We will deliver our written response to your Verified Request by mail or electronically.

For data portability requests, we will select a format in which to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a Verified Request unless such Verified Request is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded.  If we determine that a Verified Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. 

_Right to Appeal_  
In the event we deny a Verified Request, you have the right to seek an appeal of that decision.  To appeal a decision, please email californiahrprivacy@frontdoor.com and include “Privacy Appeal” in the subject line.  Within sixty (60) days of our receipt of your appeal request, we will inform you of any action taken or not taken in response to your appeal.  If you remain unsatisfied with our decision, you may contact your state’s attorney general via the contact information provided [here](https://www.naag.org/find-my-ag/). 

**Non-Discrimination**  
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the CPRA.  Unless permitted by the CPRA, we will not:

1. deny you goods or services;
2. charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
3. provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
4. suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CPRA that may result in different prices, rates or quality levels.  Any permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.  Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.  We do not currently offer any financial incentive programs relating to Personal Information.  

_Other Privacy Rights_  
The CPRA does not limit your rights under existing privacy legislation or regulation.  As such, you may request certain information about our disclosures of certain categories of Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.  All requests for such disclosure must be submitted to the Privacy Coordinator at the address set forth below.  

**Changes to Our Notice**  
We reserve the right to amend this Notice at our discretion and at any time in accordance with applicable law.  When we make changes to this Notice, we will post the updated Notice on the Frontdoor Applications and update the “Effective Date” posted within the Notice.  YOUR CONTINUED USE OF FRONTDOOR APPLICATIONS FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF CHANGES CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH CHANGES.

**Contact Information**  
If you have any questions or comments about this Notice, the ways in which Frontdoor collects and uses your Personal Information or your choices and rights regarding such collection and use under the CPRA (if applicable), please do not hesitate to contact us at:
