These Terms and Conditions govern the conditions in which you may access and use the different services available. Any and all users of the services offered by Pl@ntNet accept the present General Terms and Conditions.

Pl@ntNet trademark
------------------

The Pl@ntNet trademark is a protected trademark owned by CIRAD, INRAE, INRIA and IRD. Any use, for any purpose, of the trademark Pl@ntNet and the associated logo are strictly prohibited and may be subject to judicial proceedings.

User account
------------

Using Pl@ntNet identification service and consulting data do not require creation of a user account, but this action is necessary to participate to the project’s enrichment. When you create an account, we collect your e-mail address (useful for password reset ; might be used very ocasionnally to contact users), your name and first name (optionally) and a username (to log in). If you give your name and first name, they will be displayed next to the licence associated to the contributed images ; otherwise your username will be displayed. For security reasons, passwords are not directly stored in the database. They pass through a cryptographic hash function whose result is stored (the hashing action cannot be reversed). A unique numeric identifier is attributed to each account and will be associated to every data contributed with this account (observations, votes...).

Main Pl@ntNet features
----------------------

Identify a plant with a query The query correspons to one or many photos of the plant to identify, the date and time of observation, and optionally the GPS coordinates of the location of observation and the locality name, if those options are enabled on your terminal. When modifying a query (adding or removing an image for example), history of queries and associated results is stored. Our identification services are available on different platforms (Web, Android, iOS). In order to optimize our developments, we store the terminal type used for each query. We store query data as well as results suggested by our identification engine because those data play a crucial rôle in the set up of a partipative observatory of vegetal biodiversity, which is one of the main goals of the Pl@ntNet platform. Moreover, those data allow following the evolution of our system’s performance through time. They also lead to an improvement of this performance. Those data might be used as part of ecology and/or IT research work by Pl@ntNet team members. So we can assess wild vegetal species distribution, evolution of phenology (blooming, fructification dates...), the apparition of invasive species... or teach the identification engin to automatically reject inappropriate images (blur floues, photos which subject is not a plant...). If the user ha a Pl@ntNet account and is logged in, the numer of the associated account will be stored along with the query.

Contribute your observations Users having a Pl@ntNet account can contribute their botanical observations (the observation is linked to the account of the contributing user). This means they are made public and may be consulted by any user. If the observation comes from a previously ran query, it will be linked to this query in order to retrieve the results suggested by the identification engine, to monitor performance. An observation contains the same data as a query (image(s), date and time, GPS coordinates and location name if those features are enabled on the terminal). Additionally, the user name at contribution time is associated to the licence applied to these data (cc-by-sa). As for queries, qhared observations might be used as part of research work. If the user has an account on Tela Botanica (collaboratif network of french speaking botanists), his/her observations will automatically be shared with this partner. The goal of this exchange is to promote feedback from an expert community to Pl@ntNet observations.

Pl@ntNet data revision Users having a Pl@ntNet account may (i) revise all shared observations. They may vote for pictures quality (best ones will be promoted on species descriptive sheets and will be used as a learning basis by the identification engine), (ii) suggest or validate a determination (so that the observation is associated to the right species), and (iii) specify the plant organ (leaf, flower, fruit, branch, habit or other) that is visible on the pictures (the goal is to classify the images per organ to ease comparisons dureing identification queries). When a vote is added, the date, value, observation identifier and account identifier are stored. Data associated to observations (pictures quality, visible organs, determination) thus evolve depending on all Pl@ntNet users’ actions, and revisions made by Tela Botanica network.
