Shipping Information + FAQ
--------------------------

**Domestic Shipping (United States)**: Domestic delivery times vary, but typically take about 3-6 business days to arrive after their first scan.

**APO / FPO / DPO**: We offer shipping to all APO / FPO / DPO locations.

**International Shipping:** We ship worldwide and to all continents. International delivery times vary, but they typically take about 2 - 3 weeks after the first scan. Please note that each country has their own customs clearance process, and it is possible that you may be charged an import tax. The buyer is responsible for any taxes, duties, customs fees, and brokerage fees that may be charged. This money does not go to us and is not related to the shipping charges paid on our website, it instead goes to your country's customs office. We appreciate your understanding.

**Shipping Costs:** To calculate shipping costs, please add the desired items to the cart, then enter your shipping information. This will allow the system to pre-calculate your shipping costs, at which point you will be informed of the shipping cost.

**Undeliverable and Unclaimed Orders:** If your order is returned to us as unclaimed or undeliverable, we will be happy to arrange for a reshipment to you; however, we will need to recollect the original shipping charge.

**Processing Times**: We usually try to process orders within approximately 1-5 business days; however, we ask that you please be patient if there are delays due to recent large product launches or newly stocked backorder/preorder items. Purchases are shipped in the order that they are received. We will ship every order as quickly as possible.
