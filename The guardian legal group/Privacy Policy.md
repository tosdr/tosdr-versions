**Disclaimer**

Guardian Legal Network is a non-Attorney marketing company. This is a paid advertisement for legal services.

By contacting Guardian Legal Network, you agree to receive a call back by up to two different legal service providers, even if you are on the “do not call” registry.

Guardian Legal Network is not a law firm or Lawyer Referral Service. Guardian Legal Network does not provide legal advice, services or legal representation to anyone including but not limited to visitors to this site or people responding to our TV ads.

Guardian Legal Network is a privately held Limited Liability Company that does fee-based marketing for its law firm clients that offer legal services to individuals that allegedly have been injured by certain drugs, medical devices, and products. All disclaimers noted below apply to the following: 1.) users of this website, 2.) people seeing and/or responding to our TV ads, 3.) anyone that views or hears any marketing materials, email, or any communication from Guardian Legal Network or persons affiliated with Guardian Legal Network (“Any Communication”). All rights to these ads and properties are reserved by Guardian Legal Network.

Participating law firms vary for each campaign and change from time to time. Participating law firms are subject to change without notice.

As to campaigns related to prescription drugs:

– Do not stop taking a prescribed medication without first consulting with your doctor. Discontinuing a prescribed medication without your doctor’s advice can result in injury or death. – Do not base any medical decision on this or any other advertisement. – The subject drug remains approved by FDA.

As to campaigns related to medical devices:

– The subject medical device remains approved by FDA

Note all of the following. Your initial call may not be with a licensed attorney and does not constitute legal advice or create an attorney-client relationship. A participating law firm or their agent may evaluate your case and by that process they do not thereby establish an attorney-client relationship. Transmission of information to law firm clients of Guardian Legal Network about potential clients responding to Any Communication from Guardian Legal Network is not intended to create and does not constitute an attorney-client relationship. Viewing or hearing Any Communication from Guardian Legal Network, requesting additional information, or transmitting information back and forth, should never be considered the formation of an attorney-client relationship.

An attorney-client relationship will only be created by a written agreement between a law firm and a client.

You understand and agree that any information you initially provide to Guardian Legal Network or a law firm evaluating your case is done so voluntarily and will not be considered nor treated as confidential information until such law firm has been retained by you in writing. Since Guardian Legal Network is not a law firm, such information will never be deemed or agreed to be confidential to Guardian Legal Network.

A participating law firm may accept or reject a case at their sole discretion. Rejection of your case is not the expression of a legal opinion about your case, instead, you are encouraged to discuss the matter with any other law firm or attorney of your choice.

If there are multiple participating firms, matching of an initial inquiry to a specific law firm is done by an internal random process. Some cases may be transferred to other attorneys, discuss with your attorney.

Clients will not be responsible for a legal fee unless there is a settlement in their favor or they win at trial. However, client may be responsible for costs and any awarded costs and fees. Consult with your attorney.

The statements made in Any Communication from Guardian Legal Network do not fully state all the requirements needed for a successful case. Do not select an attorney or law firm solely based upon an advertisement. No representation is made that the quality of legal services to be performed is greater than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers or that any attorney involved with this ad or Any Communication is a licensed specialist of any state. No claim to the contrary is made by us.

Any statement contained in Any Communication from us shall not constitute nor act as a guarantee, warranty or prediction regarding the ultimate outcome of any matter or legal proceeding. Guardian Legal Network does not guarantee the accuracy of the information provided in Any Communication but believes them to be accurate. Do not use Any Communication from us as a substitute for seeking your own legal advice nor failing to make your own investigation of facts and claims and seeking advice from an appropriate professional where appropriate in your judgment.

The material and data from Any Communication from us is general in nature and may not apply to your specific circumstances. Every case comes with its own set of unique circumstances and facts.

Do not respond to us on a specific claim if you already have an attorney as to that specific claim or campaign. If you do have an attorney as to a specific claim or campaign, do not disclose any information regarding your attorney or any information.

This website is not affiliated with any pharmaceutical or medical device company or any trademarked product. The information in this site was not written by medical professionals and should not be viewed as medical or legal advice and should never interfere with a patient and his or her healthcare providers.

By placing a call to us or entering getguardianlegal.com site (and the links accessible through this site) you expressly acknowledge your understanding and agreement to all of the disclaimers and agreements contained herein.

The law firm that responds to your inquiry will have no obligation to take any action to protect your interests unless he or she agrees to do so in writing. Guardian Legal Network does not guarantee a response to your inquires, although in most cases you should be contacted by a lawyer within three business days if your inquiry has not already been answered.

You may be entitled to compensation if you or a loved one have been injured by a dangerous drug, medical device or product. The choice of an attorney is an important decision that should not be based solely upon advertisements. Results are not guaranteed.

Guardian Legal Network assumes no liability for information stated in Any Communication from us.

As to all such information received from Any Communication from us, there is no warranty, guarantee or prediction of outcome.
