Please consider your selection of such applications and services, and your permissions, carefully.

Some third parties’ embedded content or plugins on our Site and/or Software, such as Facebook “Like” buttons, may allow their operators to learn that you have visited the Site, and they may combine this knowledge with other data they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services that can identify you.

In terms of advertising and tracking, we utilize Meta Pixel (formerly Facebook Pixel) and Google Global Site Tag to manage ad campaigns and track interactions, along with Google Conversion Tracking, Bing Universal Event Tracking, and TikTok Conversion Tracking Pixel to measure the effectiveness of our advertising. We also employ Intercom for managing customer support and communications. We encourage users to periodically review this section to stay informed about how we use third-party services.

#### Social Media Interactions

When you interact with our social media pages, these services may collect personal data that you voluntarily submit, such as your public profile details, comments, and likes, and the data collected via social media platforms is governed by the privacy policies of the hosting social media company.

Data collected by third parties through these apps and plugins is subject to each parties’ own policies. We encourage you to read those policies and understand how other companies use your data.

#### Will Speechify send me emails?

From time to time, we may want to contact you with information about product announcements, software updates, and special offers. We also may want to contact you with information about products and services from our business partners. You may opt out of such communications at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found within Speechify emails and changing your contact preferences.

Unless your Speechify account is part of a Speechify for Education license, Speechify does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we determine we have collected personal information from a child younger than 13 years of age, we will take reasonable measures to remove that information from our systems. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through the Site, Service, and/or Software. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through the Site, Service, and/or Software without their permission.

Please note that in some countries the age of digital consent is older than 13. If you are in one of those countries, you must be at least that age to use the Site, Software, and/or Services.

### Data storage, transfer, retention, and deletion

#### Where is my Information stored?

Information submitted to Speechify will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States. When you use the Software on your computing device, User Content you save will be stored locally on that device and synced with our servers. If you post or transfer any Information to or through our Site, Software, and/or Services, you are agreeing to such Information, including Personal Data and User Content, being hosted and accessed in the United States. Please note that the laws of the United States may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.

#### How secure is my Information?

Speechify is committed to protecting the security of your Information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it. However, internet data transmissions, whether wired or wireless, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and as a result, we cannot ensure the security of Information you transmit to us, including Personal Data and User Content; accordingly, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.

We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit and at rest.

Once we receive your data, we protect it on our servers using a combination of technical, physical, and logical security safeguards. The security of the data stored locally in any of our Software installed on your computing device requires that you make use of the security features of your device. We recommend that you take the appropriate steps to secure all computing devices that you use in connection with our Site, Software, and/or Services.

If Speechify learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on the Site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.

#### How can I delete my Personal Data from Speechify?

You can remove your Personal Data from Speechify at any time by logging into your account, accessing the Settings page, and then deleting your account. Please note that, for security reasons, subscribers of our paid services will first be instructed to cancel their subscriptions before they can delete their Speechify account.

#### How long is Personal Data retained?

You can remove your Personal Data from Speechify at any time by deleting your account as described above. However, we may keep some of your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and to comply with our legal obligations including tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations. Other reasons include: whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records for a certain period of time before we can delete them) and whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as regarding applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).

#### What happens if Speechify closes my account?

If Speechify closes your account due to your violation of the Terms of Service, then you may contact Speechify to request deletion of your data. Speechify will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.

### Will this Privacy Policy ever change?

As Speechify evolves, we may need to update this Policy to keep pace with changes in our Site, Software, and Services, our business, and laws applicable to us and you. We will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy. We will notify you of any material changes that impact your rights under this Policy by email (to your most recently provided email address) or post any other revisions to this Policy, along with their effective date, in an easy-to-find area of the Site, so we recommend that you periodically check back here to stay informed of any changes. Please note that your continued use of Speechify after any change means that you agree with and consent to be bound by the new Policy. If you disagree with any changes in this Policy and do not wish your information to be subject to it, you will need to delete your Speechify account.

### For EEA, Swiss, and UK users

Speechify uses, processes, and stores Personal Data, including what is listed in the “[What Information does Speechify collect about me?](https://speechify.com/privacy/)” section, as necessary to perform our contract with you, and based on our legitimate interests in order to provide the Services.

### Your California Privacy Rights For California users

#### Supplemental Privacy Notice for California residents

This Supplemental Privacy Notice supplements the information in our Privacy Policy above and applies to California residents only.

#### Summary of information we collect

If you’re a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information about how we collect, use, and disclose your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).

Throughout this Privacy Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about users, the sources of that information, and how we share it. Under the CCPA, we’re also required to provide you with the “categories” of personal information we collect and disclose for business purposes (as defined by applicable law).

Those categories are:

* Identifiers (such as name, email address, or social network account and profile data);
* Commercial information (such as transaction data for a paid account);
* Financial data (such as payment method or financial account information);
* Internet or other network or device activity (such as IP address and usage information);
* Location information (e.g., the general location where you use your device when interacting with the Site, Software, and/or Services);
* Sensory information (such as audio recordings if you call our customer service);
* Inference data about you;
* Other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. We collect these categories of personal information from different sources, as described in the section titled, “What Information does Speechify collect about me?” above.

We collect and use your personal information for the following business and commercial purposes:

* To provide and maintain our services
* To communicate with you and respond to your inquiries
* To improve our website and services
* To detect, prevent, and address security or technical issues
* To comply with legal obligations

We and our service providers may use the categories of personal information we collect from and about you consistent with the various business and commercial purposes we discuss throughout this Privacy Policy. Please see the section titled “[How does Speechify use my Information?](https://speechify.com/privacy/)” above for more information. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the section titled, “[Does Speechify share my Information?](https://speechify.com/privacy/)”

We may also use the categories of personal information for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and we may aggregate the information we collect or de-identify the information to limit or prevent identification of any particular user or device.

#### Rights

If you’re a California resident, you may have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we:

* Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
* Provide you a summary of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.
* Delete certain information we have about you.

You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any). You also have the right not to be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Site, Software, and Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Site, Software, and Services.

To exercise these rights, you can:

* Request a personal data report by submitting a support ticket through [this link](https://help.speechify.com/en). You must be signed into your Speechify account to submit this request, and you may be required to log into your account to access the summary or the report.
* Request the summary described above by submitting a support ticket or emailing [\[email protected\]](https://speechify.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
* Delete your personal information from Speechify by deleting your account. You must be signed into your Speechify account to submit this request, and you will be required to provide your password to confirm that you want to delete your account.
* You can also submit requests by submitting a [support ticket](https://help.speechify.com/en) or emailing [\[email protected\]](https://speechify.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

You’ll need to provide us with information sufficient to verify your identity before we can satisfy your request. To do so, you’ll need to log into your account or provide us with certain information regarding yourself and/or your usage of the Site, Software, and Services. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you need to provide us with written authorization for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.

The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information. Based on the definition of “sell” under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we don’t believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months. Even though we do not sell your personal information, you have the right to opt-out of any potential future selling of your personal information. If you would like to opt-out of any potential future selling of your personal information, please submit a support ticket or email us at [\[email protected\]](https://speechify.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We do share certain information as described in the “Information access and disclosure” section above, and we allow third parties to collect certain information about your activity, for example through cookies, as explained in our [Cookie Policy](https://speechify.com/privacy/). You can control these cookies through browser settings and other controls; for more information, see our [Cookie Policy](https://speechify.com/privacy/).

#### Authorized Agents

California residents can also exercise their rights under the CCPA by designating an authorized agent to act on their behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may require that you provide us with written permission allowing the authorized agent to act on your behalf and verify your identity directly with us. We may also require the authorized agent to submit proof that they are authorized to act on your behalf.

#### California Shine the Light

If you’re a California resident, you can ask for a list of third parties (if any) that have received your information for their direct marketing purposes during the previous calendar year. This list also contains the types of information shared. We provide this list at no cost. To make such a request, contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://speechify.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### For Nevada Users

Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Personally identifiable information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://speechify.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.

#### Types of cookies Speechify uses

Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users/visitors as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies.

Each cookie used by Speechify falls within one of the following categories:

#### Essential cookies

Essential cookies (First-Party Cookies) are sometimes called “strictly necessary,” as without them we cannot provide many services that you need. For example, essential cookies help remember your preferences as you use our Site, Software, and/or Services.

#### Analytics cookies

These cookies track information about your visits and usage of the Site, Software, and/or Services so that we can make improvements and report our performance — for example, to analyze visitor and user behavior so as to provide more relevant content or suggest certain activities. We might also use analytics cookies to test new ads, pages, or features to see how users react to them. Google Analytics is the main technology we currently use in this regard. To learn more about Google Analytics and your privacy, visit the “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” page at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics when using our website, visit [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

#### Functionality or preference cookies

During your visit to the Site, or while you use our Software or Services, cookies are used to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region). They also store your preferences when personalizing the Site, Software, and/or Services to optimize your use of Speechify (for example, your preferred language). These preferences are remembered through the use of persistent cookies, and the next time you visit the Site or use our Software and/or Services, you will not have to set them again.

#### Cookies for promoting Speechify paid accounts

These Third-Party Cookies are placed by third-party advertising platforms or networks in order to deliver ads for Speechify paid accounts and track the performance of those ads. These platforms may subsequently use information about your visit to Speechify.com to target you with advertising for Speechify paid accounts on other websites. You can opt out of interest-based targeting provided by participating ad servers through the Digital Advertising Alliance ([http://youradchoices.com](http://youradchoices.com/)).

#### Social media cookies

The Site includes third-party social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and third-party widgets, such as the ‘Share This’ button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Site. These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Site, as well as set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interaction with these features is governed by the privacy policy of the third-party company providing it. Here are some examples of third-party social media features that we use, and their privacy policies:

* [Facebook Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy)
* [YouTube Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* [Twitter Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/privacy)
