Privacy Policy for Website, Mobile App, and Desktop App
=======================================================

BlockSite privacy policy and data collection practices.

**BlockSite – Privacy Policy for Website, Mobile App, and Desktop App**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

_\[Last modified:_ _October 14, 2021\]_

### **Introduction**

This privacy policy (“**Privacy Policy**“) governs the data collection practices BlockSite LP (“**Company**”, “**us**”, “**we**” and “**our**”) uses when you use our **_BlockSite_** mobile app or desktop app (“**BlockSite Product**”) or our website, [www.blocksite.co](https://blocksite.co/) (the “**Website**”). This Privacy Policy is provided to make important disclosures on **how** or **why** we collect, **share** and **use** our users’ information. Our users’ privacy is important to us. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully prior to using our BlockSite Product and use it to make informed decisions. If you would like to use our BlockSite add-on extension, please be sure to review and agree to the terms of the separate privacy policy available on our Website.

By using the BlockSite Product or Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the BlockSite Product or Website constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is part of our End User License Agreement (Link: https:// blocksite.co/terms) and, to the extent that the processing of personal data is based on consent _(see below)_, is a legally binding agreement between you and the Company. Definitions herein shall have the same meaning as defined therein. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use the BlockSite Product or Website.

**IF YOU OBJECT TO THESE TERMS PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR USE THE BLOCKSITE PRODUCT OR SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.**       

### **What Information Do We Collect?**

The information we collect includes non-identifiable information which may be made available or gathered via the user’s use of the BlockSite Product and, where applicable and enabled by users of the mobile app, via the Android accessibility service (“**Non-Personal Information**“). This Non-Personal Information is cleaned and scrubbed on your device – prior to being sent to our servers and prior to any other use – for the purpose of removing information that could be used to identify you. As such, we are not aware of and cannot determine the identity of the user from which the Non-Personal Information is collected.

**Non-Personal Information** collected through your use of the **desktop app** includes:

* Browsing history information (URLs/domains visited)
* Internet Protocol (IP) address – but note that we permanently delete the last portion of the IP address and hash the full IP address before storing it, thus preventing us from having the ability to use it to transmit any information to your device or to otherwise identify you
* GUID – a random number generated on your device upon app installation and stored in order to distinguish one user from another, which cannot be used to transmit any information to your device or to otherwise identify you
* User agent – which helps identify which browser is being used, what version, and on which operating system
* Tracker details – our tracker type and version
* Transition Type – how the current URL was reached (i.e., via manual typing, tab switching, or link clicking)
* Browser profile counter – a random number generated to distinguish between different users using the same browser

**Non-Personal Information** collected through your use of the **mobile app** includes:

Android

* Technical information (operating system version, device model name, screen size, and mobile network code, browser type);
* Browsing history information (URLs/domains visited, and the dates, times and durations of visits)
* List of installed apps (app name, app ID, installation and update date, version, whether app is a system app, whether app is on home page)
* App usage (including duration of use) – but note that we do not collect data from within the installed apps, but rather solely aggregated data concerning use itself
* GUID – a random number generated on your device upon app installation and stored in order to distinguish one user from another, which cannot be used to transmit any information to your device or to otherwise identify you
* Internet Protocol (IP) address – but note that we permanently delete the last portion of the IP address and hash the full IP address before storing it, thus preventing us from having the ability to transmit any information to your device or to otherwise identify you.

Android app permissions requested (“**Permission**”):

* App Usage: this Permission enables us to understand the user’s browsing habits, in order to enable the user to improve their productivity.
* Accessibility: this Permission enables us to block unwanted websites or apps and enable the safe use of your device and browser, which is the app’s core functionality. For more information, please see “How is the Data Used” Section below.

To access these Permissions, you will need to explicitly enable them through an in-app permission or the mobile settings. You may disable these Permissions at any time. However, depending on the Permission you choose to disable, a feature or all features may not operate properly. We share the information obtained through the Permissions to provide the Services.

iOS

* Device information (operating system version and device model name)
* Browsing history information (URLs/domains visited, and the dates and times of visits)
* Internet Protocol (IP) address – but note that we permanently delete the last portion of the IP address and hash the full IP address before storing it, thus preventing us from having the ability to transmit any information to your device or to otherwise identify you
* Country
* GUID – a random number generated on your device upon app installation and stored in order to distinguish one user from another, which cannot be used to transmit any information to your device or to otherwise identify you
* IDFA (Apple identifier for advertisers)
* User agent – which helps identify which browser is being used, what version, and on which operating system

Such Non-Personal Information is processed for the purposes described in the “How Is the Data Used?” section hereunder.

We do not collect from you any individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort be used to identify an individual (“**Personal Information**“) except as may be voluntarily provided by you if and when you register and create an account or otherwise contact us, such as your name and email address, provided that such information will be used solely to communicate with and support you, and will not be shared with any third parties except as set forth in the “How is the Data Shared” section below.

### **How is the Data Used?**

We collect your information during your access or use of the BlockSite Website or the BlockSite Product as detailed above, and use that information to block your access to certain sites based on parameters you define and control (the “**Services**”). We use that information based on our legitimate interests in promoting and improving the BlockSite Product and our services, on the necessity of such information for the provision of the BlockSite Product and our services where applicable (as described in this Privacy Policy) or, where permitted under applicable law, on the implied consent that you provide by using the BlockSite Product, or by requesting support, registering for the BlockSite Product, or through your use of the various forums and blogs available within the website.

In practice, in order to provide the BlockSite Product and the Services, we need to scan the webpages you browse, and we need to retrieve the apps you are trying to open. Meaning, we use the data collected from you, as detailed and specified above, and transmit it to our servers for the purpose of enabling the BlockSite Product and in order to know when and where there is content, a website or an app to block. Thus, the processing of Non-Personal Information in this context is necessary for a user-facing feature, namely the provision of the Services as described above. Accordingly, without access to such information, some or all of the site-blocking would not work. You acknowledge and agree that by using the BlockSite website and by downloading and using the BlockSite Product, you request that we provide you with the Services.

We also use Non-Personal Information, aggregated information or statistics regarding your use of the Services, which do not describe or identify any individual user, in order to monitor and understand user interest and improve the Services. 

### **How is the Data Shared?**

We do **not** share any Personal Information collected from you with third parties or any of our partners. We may disclose information you submitted if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary:

(i) to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request;

(ii) to enforce our policies (including our policies and agreements), including investigations of potential violations thereof;

(iii) investigate, detect, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or other wrongdoing, suspected fraud or security issues;

(iv) to establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims;

(v) to prevent harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users, yourself or any third party; or

(vi) for the purpose of collaborating with law enforcement agencies or in case we find it necessary in order to enforce intellectual property or other legal rights.

Note that we may also appoint third-party service providers, or have certain services provided by one of our affiliated companies, operating under our instructions, who may need access to your information in connection with their services on our behalf. Transfers of your Personal Information will be made in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

We will take the necessary steps to ensure that international transfers of personal data (including Personal Information) meet all requirements under applicable data protection laws. When personal data collected within the European Economic Area (“**EEA**“) is transferred outside the EEA, we will take the steps necessary to ensure that the transfer of such data provides sufficient safeguards, and you may exercise your rights, where applicable, to receive information on such transfer mechanism.

These third parties may use and store their own Cookies on your device, which Cookies may collect information about you, including Personal Information, subject to the privacy practices of these third parties. These third-party Cookies may collect information such as how often users access our Website, what pages users visit, and when.

We use the information we receive from third parties such as Google Analytics based on our legitimate interests in promoting and improving the BlockSite Product and our services. Note that we do not combine the information collected through the use of third-party tools with any Personal Information collected from you. You may remove Cookies by following the instructions on your device governing the setting of your preferences.

These are some of the tools used in our Products and/or Website:

Hotjar

We use [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize our service and user experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and do not like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices (in particular device IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display our website). Hotjar stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile. Neither Hotjar nor we will ever use this information to identify individual users or to match it with further data on an individual user. For further details, please see Hotjar’s privacy policy by clicking on [this link](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy).

You can opt out of the creation of a user profile, Hotjar’s storing of data about your usage of our site and Hotjar’s use of tracking cookies on other websites, by following this [opt-out link](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out).

Taboola

Our Website uses technologies from Taboola Inc. (28 West 23rd St. 5th Fl, New York, NY 10010, [www.taboola.com](http://www.taboola.com/), “Taboola”). Taboola uses Cookies that determine how you navigate our Website, which of our pages you visit, and to determine what content and video services you use. The Cookie enables us to create pseudonymous user profiles by collecting device-related data as well as log data, and to recommend content that suits your personal interests, so that we can design our offer individually for you. These usage profiles are not merged with data about the bearer of the pseudonym and do not allow us to draw any conclusions about the data subject. For more information about Taboola and the ability to disable the Taboola Cookie, visit [https://www.taboola.com/privacy-policy](https://www.taboola.com/privacy-policy).

Facebook Pixel

Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook Inc. (1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, “Facebook”).

These allow the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider’s website, allowing an analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future optimization.

The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users’ identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the [Facebook privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/). This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We have no control over how this data is used.  See Facebook’s privacy policy to learn more about protecting your privacy: [https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/).

**You can deactivate the Facebook custom audiences remarketing feature in the Ads Settings section at** [**https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry\_product=ad\_settings\_screen**](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen)**.**

Firebase

We use Firebase ([https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/)) for user registration and authentication, for users who decide to create accounts and provide their email address and create passwords for that purpose. For further details, please see Firebase’s privacy policy by clicking on [this link](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy#firebase_data_processing_and_security_terms).

PayPal and Stripe

For further details, please see PayPal’s privacy policy by clicking on [this link](https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full) and Stripe’s privacy policy by clicking on [this link](https://stripe.com/privacy).

Google AdMob

Our Product may serve third-party advertisements, delivered to you by Google. Google processes an advertising ID from the device on which ads are served to determine interests, demographics and other data, which may be used to serve better targeted ads to the user via the Google Mobile Ads SDK.

In order to assert any of these rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at: dpo@blocksite.co. Note that we may request proof of your identity, and we reserve the right to charge a fee where allowed by law, such as in circumstances where your request is deemed to be excessive.

In addition, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, subject to applicable law (as is the case in the European Union).

### **How do we safeguard your information?**

We make best efforts to use security methods and encryptions when handling sensitive data (i.e., handle the user data securely, including transmitting it via modern cryptography). Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the BlockSite Products cannot be 100% guaranteed.

### **Minors**

Children under 13 are **prohibited** from using the BlockSite Product. In the event that we become aware that a user under the age of 13 has shared any information, we will discard such information. If you have any reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has shared any information with us, please contact our Data Protection Officer at: dpo@blocksite.co. If you are under 18, please be sure to read this policy with your parents or legal guardians and ask questions about things you do not understand.

### **Additional Rights of California Users**

California residents have certain additional rights, pursuant to California privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**”). The CCPA defines “personal information” as any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to a particular California resident or household, but excluding publicly available data. This section does not apply to our handling of publicly available information or other personal information subject to an exemption pursuant to Section 1798.145(c)-(f) of the CCPA.

**Personal Information that We Collect, Disclose, and Sell**

The following list (our “Notice of Collection”) describes the categories of personal information about California residents that we collect, from the sources listed in the “What Information Do We Collect” section above. We do not sell your personal information or disclose it to third parties for a business purpose. We may disclose these categories of personal information to our service providers, solely for their use as necessary to perform services on our behalf. The personal information collected is used according to the “How is the Data Used” section above. 

Note that the term “sale” is defined broadly in the CCPA to include any exchange of data for consideration of any kind.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Categories of personal information** | Do we collect this data? | Do we disclose  this data for a business purpose? | Do we sell this data? |
| Name, Contact Information & Other Identifiers | _YES_ | _YES_ | _NO_ |
| Customer Records: Customer records including personal information such as name, address, and telephone number | _YES_ | _YES_ | _NO_ |
| Purchase History and Tendencies: Commercial information including records of products purchased or used | _YES_ | _YES_ | _NO_ |
| Usage Data: Internet or other electronic network activity information, including information related to  interaction with a website or application, access logs and other activity information related to use of our products or services | _YES_ | _YES_ | _NO_ |

**Your Rights as a California Consumer**

Consumers have certain rights under California law, which restricts certain business practices, and which gives California consumers the right to request disclosure of what personal information about you we collect, use, disclose, and sell.  This includes (a) the right to opt out of the sale (if applicable) of your personal information; (b) the right to request, at no charge up to twice every 12 months: (i) a copy the personal information collected from you in the preceding 12 months; (ii) deletion of the personal information collected from you; (iii) disclosure of certain information about how we handled your personal information in the prior 12 months (your “Right to Know”), including certain information on the categories of information collected, the categories of sources, the business purposes for its collection and sale (if applicable), and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared.

You may exercise the foregoing rights by (a) clicking [here](https://forms.gle/fsKgfXFfNY1CAkMq6) ; (b) contacting us at [dpo@blocksite.co](mailto:dpo@blocksite.co).

If you submit one of these requests, we will first try to verify your identity. Then, we will attempt to match the information provided in your request with personal information we have about you, if any. If you have created an account on our Product or Website, we may ask you, as part of our identity verification process, to sign in to your account. We will take further action on your request only where we are reasonably satisfied that we have verified your identity. We will use reasonable efforts to respond to your request within forty-five days after we receive and verify it, or, if we cannot do so, then we will respond over the following forty-five day period.  

The CCPA does not allow any discrimination against California consumers for exercising their rights under the CCPA. In addition, financial incentives offered to California consumers related to their personal information are subject to certain requirements imposed by the CCPA. In particular: (a) A company may not discriminate against a consumer who exercised his/her rights under the CCPA, such as by denying or providing a different level or quality of services to the consumer, or by charging different prices or rates to, or imposing penalties on the consumer, unless reasonably related to the value provided by the consumer’s data.

Your Rights under Califormia’s Shine-the-Light Law.  California’s “Shine-the-Light” law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83), provides that California residents who provide certain personal information to us have the right to request and obtain from us, free of charge, information about the personal information we have shared with third parties for their own direct marketing use (if any). These requests may be made once each calendar year regarding information shared with a third party in the previous calendar year. To make such a request, please submit the request in writing to dpo@blocksite.co, and include in the request a statement confirming that you are a California resident.

**Amendments**

We reserve the right to periodically amend or revise the Privacy Policy; material changes will be effective immediately upon the display of the revised Privacy Policy. The last revision date will be reflected in the “Last modified” heading. Your continued use of the BlockSite Product, following the notification of such amendments on our website, constitutes your acknowledgement of such amendments to the Privacy Policy and, where the processing of personal data is based on consent (_see above_), your agreement to be bound by the terms of such amendments.

### **How to contact us?**

If you have any questions about these terms, please contact us at: support@blocksite.co.
