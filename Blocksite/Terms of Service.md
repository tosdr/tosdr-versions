All other trademarks, service marks, product names, copyrights and logos appearing on or through the Service or Product are the property of their respective owners. You may not use or display any trademark, service mark, product name, trade name, or logo appearing on or through the Service without the owner’s prior written consent.

You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the Service or the Product is at your sole risk. The Service, Product and the information and materials therein are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis.  The Company does not provide any user assurance or warrant the accuracy, comprehensibility, reliability, correctness or completeness of the Service or Product, whether to you or to any other party. Where permitted by law, the Company and its partners or service providers specifically disclaim any representation or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, title, non-infringement or fitness for any particular purpose. The Company does not provide any warranty, representation or user assurance that your use of the Service, the Product, or any results you (or any other person or entity) may obtain from use of the Product or Service, shall be uninterrupted, timely, without delays, secure or error-free, or that any defects shall be corrected, or that the Product or Service will meet any third party’s expectations.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Company be liable for special, incidental, consequential, direct, indirect, exemplary, punitive or tort damages, including, but not limited to, damages resulting from loss of use, loss of data, loss of profits, loss of business, or diminution of value arising out of, in connection with, related to or arising in any manner out of the use of, or the inability to use, or any decision or action taken in reliance upon, the Service or Product, and whether based in tort, contract, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, even if we are or have been expressly advised of the possibility of such damages. If you become dissatisfied in any way with the Product or Service, your sole and exclusive remedy is to uninstall the Product. You hereby waive any and all claims against the Company, and its affiliates, agents, representatives and licensors arising out of your use of the Service or Product. If any portion of this limitation on liability is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then the aggregate liability of the Company and its affiliates shall not exceed the lesser of the cost of the Service or the Product.

### Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold the Company and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees, harmless from any alleged claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your access to or use of the Service or the Product or to any matter governed by this Agreement. The user is solely responsible for his or her actions when using the Service or Product.

### Termination and Service Interruptions

At any time, you may stop using the Product or related Service by (i) uninstalling the extension through your browser’s settings, or uninstalling the mobile app directly from your device or through the app page on the applicable mobile application store and (ii) if you have purchased a Premium Plan, cancelling your plan per the “Paid Subscription Plans” section above. We reserve the right, at any time, to: (a) discontinue or modify any aspect of the Product or Service; or (b) terminate this Agreement and your use of the Product or Service with or without cause, and shall not be liable to you or any third party for any of the foregoing. The Company does not assume any responsibility with respect to, or in connection with, the termination of the Product or Service or this Agreement.

You acknowledge that: (i) your access to and use of the Product or Service may be suspended for the duration of any unanticipated or unscheduled downtime or unavailability of any portion or all of the Product or Service for any reason, including as a result of power outages, system failures or other interruptions; and (ii) we shall be entitled, without any liability to you, to suspend access to any portion or all of the Product or Service at any time (a) for scheduled downtime to permit us to conduct maintenance or make modifications to the Product or Service; or (b) in the event that we determine that the Product or the Service are prohibited by law or we otherwise determine that it is necessary or prudent to do so for legal or regulatory reasons (collectively, “Services Interruptions“).

The availability and functionality of the Product and Service depends on various factors, including software, hardware and communication networks that are provided by third parties. These factors are not fault-free. The Company does not warrant that the Product or Service will operate without disruption, errors or interruptions, or that it will be accessible, or available at all times or be immune from errors or unauthorized access. We reserve the right to add additional features to the Product and Service or to provide updates, upgrades or programming fixes; we have no obligation to make available to you any subsequent versions of the Product or Service.

### Governing Law

Except for disputes relating to the Company’s intellectual property (such as any patents (registered or pending), copyrights, trade secrets, designs or trademarks) (“Excluded Disputes“), you agree that all disputes between you and the Company (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with the Company, including without limitation disputes related to this Agreement or rights of privacy or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and the Company hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor the Company will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s claim, if the Company is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any other provision under applicable law, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this Agreement. You must include your name and residence address, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with the Company. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of this Agreement and the Excluded Disputes, or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with the Company exclusively in a state or federal court located in New York County, New York, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in New York County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. Any cause of action you might have relating to the Service is limited in time to one (1) year from the arising incident, and will be permanently barred afterwards. Failure of the Company to enforce any rights or to take action against you in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of such rights or of subsequent actions in the event of future breaches.

### Amendments

The Company reserves the right, with or without notice to you, to amend, modify, update or make changes to this Agreement in its sole discretion. Continued use or access to the Service or Product, or any part thereof, constitutes your acceptance of such changes. The date of the last amendments shall be reflected in the “Last modified” heading.

### Entire Agreement, Severability, Agency, Assignment and Headers

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company, and supersedes any prior agreement. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. You may not assign or otherwise transfer by operation of law or otherwise this Agreement or any right or obligation herein. The Company expressly reserves its right to assign or transfer this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder at its sole discretion. Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of the relevant section. The Company’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
