To Learn more about our Premium Plans, please visit [https://blocksite.co/purchase](https://blocksite.co/pricing).

We may change our Premium Plans and their associated terms, including prices, at any time; however, once you have purchased a specific Premium Plan, any changes to your existing plan will apply no earlier than thirty (30) days following our notice to you, which may be provided via the email address you provided upon purchasing your Premium Plan or via the Product for which you purchased a Premium Plan, as applicable.

Should you choose to purchase a Premium Plan, your subscription fees and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of our Product or Service, such as taxes and/or transaction fees, as applicable, will be charged to you via the payment method you provided upon purchasing your Premium Plan and, depending on the Product for which you purchased a Premium  Plan, will be charged through a third-party and subject to such third-party’s terms and conditions applicable to payments, as further described in the table below. The length of your billing period will depend on the type of subscription that you chose upon purchasing your Premium Plan.

You may cancel your Premium Plan at any time by following the instructions in the table below related to the Product for which you purchased a Premium Plan. If you have opened a user account with BlockSite, you may also visit [https://user.blocksite.co/](https://user.blocksite.co/login) to cancel your Premium Plan.

You hereby waive any and all claims against the Company, and its affiliates, agents, representatives and licensors arising out of your use of the Service or Product.

### Governing Law

Except for disputes relating to the Company’s intellectual property (such as any patents (registered or pending), copyrights, trade secrets, designs or trademarks) (“Excluded Disputes“), you agree that all disputes between you and the Company (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with the Company, including without limitation disputes related to this Agreement or rights of privacy or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and the Company hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor the Company will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s claim, if the Company is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any other provision under applicable law, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this Agreement. You must include your name and residence address, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with the Company. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of this Agreement and the Excluded Disputes, or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with the Company exclusively in a state or federal court located in New York County, New York, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in New York County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. Any cause of action you might have relating to the Service is limited in time to one (1) year from the arising incident, and will be permanently barred afterwards. Failure of the Company to enforce any rights or to take action against you in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of such rights or of subsequent actions in the event of future breaches.

### Amendments

The Company reserves the right, with or without notice to you, to amend, modify, update or make changes to this Agreement in its sole discretion. Continued use or access to the Service or Product, or any part thereof, constitutes your acceptance of such changes. The date of the last amendments shall be reflected in the “Last modified” heading.

### Entire Agreement, Severability, Agency, Assignment and Headers

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company, and supersedes any prior agreement. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. You may not assign or otherwise transfer by operation of law or otherwise this Agreement or any right or obligation herein. The Company expressly reserves its right to assign or transfer this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder at its sole discretion. Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of the relevant section. The Company’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
