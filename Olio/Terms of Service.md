**Please read this agreement carefully before accessing the App or Hubs from our website or downloading the App from any Appstore.** 

**Introduction:**

This end-user licence agreement (“**EULA”**) is a legal agreement between you (“**End-user**” or “**you”**) and Olio Exchange Limited (registered number 09428660) of 157A Nelson Road, London, England, N8 9RR (“**Licensor”**, “**us”, “our”** or “**we”**) for the licence of our:

* Olio mobile application software and the web-based version of the App (the “**App”**); 
* Volunteer Hub and Partner Hub (together the “**Hubs**”);
* online or electronic documents (“**Documents”**); and
* the services you connect to via the App or Hubs and the content we provide to you through it (the “**Services”**). 

We licence the use of the App, Hubs, Documents and Services to you on the basis of this EULA and subject to any terms, rules or policies applied by any appstore provider or operator from whose site (“**Appstore**”) the End-user downloaded the App (the “**Appstore Rules**”). With regards to the App, the Appstore Rules will apply instead of the terms of this EULA where there are differences between the two.

Although you may subscribe for our Services, we do not sell the App, Hubs, Services or Documents to you. We remain the owners of the App, Hubs, Services and Documents at all times.

**Important notice:**

By accessing the App, Hubs, or by downloading the App from any Appstore provider you: 

* agree to the terms of this EULA which will bind you. The terms of this licence include the limitations on liability in condition 6;
* represent that you are 18 years of age or over and are legally capable of entering into a binding agreement; and
* accept this EULA and agree that you are legally bound by its terms.

If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, we will not licence the App, Hubs, Documents and Services to you and you must stop the downloading process or your access now.

We recommend saving a copy of this EULA for future reference.

**Agreed Terms:**

1. **Acknowledgements**
    1. The terms of this EULA apply to the App, the Hubs, the Documents and the Services, including any updates or supplements to the App and Hubs, unless they come with separate terms, in which case those terms apply. If any open-source software is included in the App, Hubs or any Service, the terms of an open-source licence may override some of the terms of this EULA. 
    2. Olio may alter or amend these terms at any time and shall notify you of significant changes by email or via the App. By continuing to use the Services,the App, and/or the Hubs after notification, you will be deemed to have accepted any changes or amendment to these terms. 
    3. From time to time updates to the App may be issued through the Appstore. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the Services until you have downloaded or streamed the latest version of the App and accepted any new terms.
    4. You will be assumed to have obtained permission from the owners of the mobile telephone, laptop or handheld devices (“**Devices**”) that are controlled, but not owned by you to download or access a copy of the App onto or from the Devices. You and they may be charged by your and their service providers for internet access on the Devices. You accept responsibility in accordance with the terms of this EULA for the use of the App, Hubs or any Service on or in relation to any Device, whether or not it is owned by you. 
    5. By using the App, Hubs or any Service, you acknowledge and agree that internet transmissions are never completely private or secure. You understand that any message or information you send using the App, Hubs or any Service may be read or intercepted by others, even if there is a special notice that a particular transmission is encrypted.
    6. We only use any personal data we collect through your use of the App, Hubs and the Services in the ways set out in our P[rivacy Policy](https://olioex.com/privacy-policy/).

You will need to make your own independent judgement regarding your interaction with any Third-party Sites, including the purchase and use of any products or services accessible through them. 
    8. Any words following the terms “including”, “include”, “in particular” or, “for example” or any similar phrase in this EULA shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the generality of the related general words.
    9. Any words used but not defined in the EULA shall have the same meanings as set out in the Terms and Conditions.

    2. You acknowledge and agree that all intellectual property rights in the App, the Hubs, the Documents and the Services anywhere in the world belong to us or our licensors, that rights in the App, Hubs, Documents and Services are licensed to you, and that you have no rights in, or to, the App, the Hubs, the Documents or the Services other than the right to use each of them in accordance with the terms of this EULA.
    3. You acknowledge that you have no right to have access to the App and the Hubs in source-code form.
6. **Limitation Of Liability**
    1.

    2. We supply the App, the Hubs, the Services and Documents for domestic, private and business use. You agree not to use the App, the Hubs, the Services and Documents for resale purposes, and we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

In no event will we be liable for any direct, indirect, special, or consequential losses or damages of whatsoever kind arising out of access to, or the use of the App, Hubs, Documents and/or Services or related websites or any information contained in them, including loss of profit and the like whether or not in the contemplation of the parties, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility of such losses or damages.
    4. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Olio and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of any kind, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from or relating to your use or misuse of the App, Hubs, Documents and/or the Services or your breach of this EULA.

    7. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so some or all of the above limitations of liability may not apply to you. For example, nothing in this EULA shall limit or exclude our liability to users in the UK for:
        1. death or personal injury resulting from our negligence;
        2. fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; and

Your access to and use of such Content and Services are governed by our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy which are incorporated herein by reference.

    3. You may only transfer your rights or obligations under this EULA to another person if we agree in writing.
    4. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this EULA, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and it will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you. 
    5. Each of the conditions of this EULA operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.
    6. Geographic Restrictions. The Content and Services are based in the United Kingdom and provided for access and use by anyone subject to local laws and restrictions. You acknowledge that you may not be able to access all or some of the Content and Services outside of the United Kingdom and that access thereto may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries.

    8.

    9. The mediation will take place in London, England and the language of the mediation will be English. The Mediation Agreement referred to in the Model Procedure shall be governed by, and construed and take effect in accordance with, the substantive law of England and Wales. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of commencement of the mediation or within such further period as the parties may agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to the courts of England and Wales.
    10. This EULA, our Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and Company with respect to the App, the Volunteer Hub, the Documents and the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to the App, the Volunteer Hub, the Documents and the Services. 
    11. This EULA has been entered into on the date of download of or access to the App and/or the Hubs, whichever comes first.
    12. Waiver. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder. In the event of a conflict between this EULA and any other terms, the terms of this EULA shall take precedence.
    13. Disclaimer of warranties. The App, the Hubs, the Documents and the Services are provided to the End-User “as is” and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. The Company on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the App, the Hubs, the Documents and the Services including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of the course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.

    14. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you. 
11. **Terms applicable in the United States of America**
    1. The following terms apply in addition to those set out above for users in the United States of America.
    2. The App may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations.

You shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations and rules, and complete all required undertakings including obtaining any necessary export licence or other governmental approval, prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing or otherwise making the App available outside the US.
    3. US Government Rights. The App is a commercial computer software, as such term is defined in 48 C.F.R. §2.101. Accordingly, if you are an agency of the US Government or any contractor thereof, you receive only those rights with respect to the App as are granted to all other end users under licence, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. §227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. §227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. §12.212, with respect to all other US Government licensees and their contractors.
