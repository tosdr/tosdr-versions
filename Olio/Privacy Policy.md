4. **How Data is collected**
    1. Automatic Data collection and tracking
        1. When you download, access and use the App, it may use technology to automatically collect:
            * **Usage details:** when you access and use the App, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the App, including traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on or through the App. 
            * **Device information:** we may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device’s unique device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information and the device’s telephone number.
            * **Stored information and files:** the App also may access metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your device. This may include, for example, photographs, audio and video clips, personal contacts and address book information. You will be asked for your consent to such access and use of your Data within the App.  You can withdraw your consent at any time via the settings menu.

Some of our location-enabled services require your Data for the feature to work. You will be asked for your consent to such access and use of your Data within the App. Note, however, that opting out of the App’s collection of location information will cause its location-based features to be disabled.

6. **Keeping Data secure**
    1. We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your Data from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration and disclosure, for example:

        2. we store your Data on secure servers.
    2. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the App like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the App.
    3. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Data transmitted through our App. Any transmission of Data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide. 
    4. If you suspect that there has been a breach of the security of your data you should contact us at: [hello@olioapp.com](mailto:hello@olioex.com) and include details of the nature, the date and the full circumstances of the breach.
    5. On notification of such a breach, we will investigate the matter and, where appropriate and required by law, notify the relevant data protection regulator.
7. **How personal data is shared and with whom.**
    1. You may provide information to be published or displayed (“**Posted**“) on public areas of the App (collectively, “**User Contributions**“). Your User Contributions are Posted and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of third parties with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorised persons.
    2. We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual or device, without restriction. 
    3. In addition, we may disclose Data that we collect or you provide:
        1. to our subsidiaries and affiliates.
        2. to contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Data confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
        3. to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganisation, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of the Company’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which Data held by the Company about our App users is among the assets transferred.
        4. to fulfil the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you give us an email address to use the “email a friend” feature of our App, we will transmit the contents of that email and your email address to the recipients.
        5. for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
        6. for the purposes of academic research.
        7. for any other purpose with your consent.

8. **What choices you have with respect to how personal data is used.**
    1. We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Data you provide to us. This section describes mechanisms we provide for you to control certain uses and disclosures of your information. You may need to adjust the settings on your device to restrict the collection of information by the App but this may prevent you from accessing all of the features of the App.
        1. **Tracking Technologies:** you may be able to set your browser or device to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies or block the use of other tracking technologies, some parts of the App may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
        2. **Location Information:** you can choose whether or not to allow the App to collect and use real-time information about your device’s location through the device’s privacy settings. If you block the use of location information, some parts of the App may then be inaccessible or not function properly. For example, users have the ability to only allow manual geolocation (rather than using their device’s autolocating functionality), the provision of at least one piece of location data (i.e. the user’s search location) is a requirement for the App to function.
        3. **Promotion by the Company:** if you do not want us to use your email address or other Data to send you information, notifications, news, surveys or promote our own products or services, you can opt-out by logging into the App and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by sending us an email stating your request to [hello@olioapp.com](mailto:hello@olioex.com). 
        4. **Targeted advertising by the Company:** we do not use information that we collect or that you provide to us to deliver our own advertisements.
        5. **Disclosure of your information for third-party advertising and marketing:** we do not share your Data with third parties for advertising and marketing purposes. However, we may include offers from third parties in our marketing materials and via links or pop-ups in the App.
    2. We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way.  (Note: In the United States of America you can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI“) on the NAI’s website).
9. **Your rights with respect to personal data.**
    1. You have the following rights in relation to your Data:
        1. **Right to access:** the right to request copies of the Data we hold about you at any time. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this, unless your request is “manifestly unfounded or excessive.” Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request.

    4. We will respond to a request to access, correct or delete any data within 30 days of the date we receive the request. 
    5. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate or breach any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. 
    6. If you delete your User Contributions from the App, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other App users. Proper access and use of information provided on the App, including User Contributions, is governed by our Terms and Conditions. 
10. **How long personal data is kept?**
    1. Unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, we will only hold your Data on our systems for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy policy or until you request that the Data be deleted.
