IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER, HOWEVER, THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS OF YOUR STATE OF RESIDENCE, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 27.

19\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; INFORMAL RESOLUTION AND FORMAL RESOLUTION BY ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER  
Any legal or equitable claim relating to your use of this Site, these Terms and Conditions, or the use or purchase of any products from BulbHead (referred to as a “Claim”) will be resolved as follows:

A. INFORMAL RESOLUTION:

In the event that any dispute between BulbHead and you arises out of or relates to the BulbHead.com Site, these Terms and Conditions, the applicability of these Terms and Conditions to the use of the BulbHead.com Site, or the use or purchase of any products from BulbHead.com, you and we agree to try to promptly resolve any such dispute informally. Please send a written notice describing the dispute to 79 Two Bridges Rd, Fairfield, NJ 07004.

B. FORMAL RESOLUTION BY ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER:

READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY, IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION. If you and BulbHead cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim asserted by either you or BulbHead will be resolved only by binding Arbitration subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.

By agreeing to Arbitration, you are waiving your rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. Instead of suing in court, both you and BulbHead agree to settle disputes only by Arbitration. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. The rules in Arbitration are different. There is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in these Terms and Conditions as a court would.

The Arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions, the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions will govern. You may, in Arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to the law of the governing state. If you decide to initiate Arbitration, BulbHead agrees to pay the Arbitration initiation fee and any additional required deposit required by JAMS to initiate your Arbitration. You and BulbHead agree to pay the costs of the Arbitration proceeding provided however that if you are a consumer you shall not be required to pay more than $250.00 of the fees or such amount as the JAMS Rules may later prescribe. All other fees, such as attorneys’ fees and expenses of travel to the Arbitration, will be paid in accordance with JAMS Rules. The Arbitration will be held at a location in your home town area if possible, unless you and BulbHead both agree to another location or telephonic Arbitration. To initiate Arbitration, you or BulbHead must do the following things:

(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.

You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.

(2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to:

JAMS \[to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, 620 Eighth Ave., 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018\].

(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the last known physical address of the other party.

Special Rules in the Arbitration Proceeding. (i) The arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any Federal or State court that has jurisdiction. (ii) Neither you nor BulbHead shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in Arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. THIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION WHATSOEVER. Accordingly, you and BulbHead agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our Arbitration.

A court may sever any portion of this dispute resolution provision if it finds such unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative and private attorney general arbitrations. Notwithstanding the obligation to arbitrate all Claims under these Terms and Conditions, you may assert an individual Claim in small claims court in lieu of Arbitration.

20\. Limited Time to File Claims  
You must assert any Claim relating to use of this Site or the purchase of any products from BulbHead within one (1) year after the Claim arises, or such Claim will be barred.

SEE SECTION 27 BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 20.

21\. Force Majeure  
We are not responsible to you for events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), embargoes, postal disruption, communication disruption, unavailability of payment processors, failure or shortage of infrastructure, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.

SEE SECTION 27 BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 21.

22\. Severability  
In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.

23\. Non-Waiver  
BulbHead reserves all rights under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or any applicable law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.

24\. Termination & Cancellation  
We may terminate your access to our Site and Service at our discretion without explanation, though we will strive to provide a timely explanation in most cases. Our liability for refunding you, if you have paid anything to us, will be limited to the amount you paid for goods or services which have not yet been and will not be delivered, except in cases where the termination or cancellation was due to your breach of this Agreement, in which case we are not required to provide any refund or other compensation whatsoever.

Under no circumstances, including termination or cancellation of our Service to you, will we be liable for any losses related to actions of other Users.

SEE SECTION 27 BELOW FOR IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 24.

25\. Assignment of Rights  
You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party at our discretion.

26\. Amendments  
We reserve the right to amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time by posting updated Terms and Conditions and/or an updated Privacy Policy on the Site. Your continued use of our Service shall constitute your acceptance of any such amendments.

27\. EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS; CONSUMER PROTECTION NOTICE  
Nothing in this Section shall modify Subsection 20(B) (“Formal Resolution by Arbitration/Class Action Waiver”).

For Jurisdictions that do not allow us to limit our liability: If you are a consumer, the provisions in these Terms and Conditions are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the laws of your State of residence. Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law. Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence or that of any of our officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.

IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR & YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.

A. New Jersey Users and Residents

If you are a New Jersey consumer, the terms of Sections 9, 11(B), 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, and 24 do not limit or waive your rights as a consumer under New Jersey law and the provisions in these Terms and Conditions are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the laws of the State of New Jersey.
