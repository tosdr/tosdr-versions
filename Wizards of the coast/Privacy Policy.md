**B. Information Collected Automatically**

We automatically collect information when you use our Service. The categories of information we have automatically collected in the last 12 months include the following:

* **Service Use Data.** We collect data about the features you use, the products or services you view and purchase, the time of day you browse, information regarding your interaction with the Service, and the web pages you visit.
* **Game-Related Data**. We collect data about your use of games made available through the Service (“Game-Related Data”). Game-Related Data includes information about your game preferences, participation, performance and achievements in the game, your frequency of play, etc.
* **Device, Connectivity, and Configuration Data.** We collect data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software, your regional and language settings, and other similar information. This also includes IP address, MAC address, mobile Ad Ids (e.g., IDFA or AAID), and other device identifiers.
* **Location Data.** We collect data about your location, which can be precise or imprecise. Precise location data can be Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data (e.g., GPS), as well as data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots. We collect precise location data when you enable location-based products or features. Imprecise location data includes, for example, a location derived from your IP address or data that indicates where you are located with less precision, such as at a city or postal code level.
* **Video Data**. Certain of our games may allow you to activate the camera on your device and broadcast video of your gameplay to other players within the game. For example, when you use SpellTable to play Magic: The Gathering, you may have the option to activate the camera on your device in order to show the physical cards to other players within the game. If you activate the camera, we will only access and collect video through the camera for the purpose of providing this functionality to you. We will not use the video for any other purpose or share or disclose the video with anyone outside of our Service, except where necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our rights or those of anyone else, or where otherwise instructed by you or to facilitate organized play activities. In addition, you can disable your camera at any time through your device settings. Notwithstanding the above, we may use non-video data collected in connection with your use of the camera for additional purposes such as data analytics and improving our internal ad servers or as otherwise in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We use various current – and later – developed technologies to collect this data (“Tracking Technologies”), including the following:

* **Log Files.** Log files are files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries help Wizards determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our Service, which pages they've visited, and other similar data. We also use log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you.

* **Cookies**. Cookies are pieces of information placed on your device when you visit a website that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use "cookies" to enhance your experience at our Service and to help us understand how you interact with our Service. For example, a cookie may allow us to remember certain things based on your IP address, such as the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content, and where you exited a particular site. To learn more about how we use cookies, please visit our [**Cookie Policy**](http://company.wizards.com/legal/cookies) or floating cookie icon on the Service.
* **Clear GIFs**. Clear GIFs, sometimes called “pixel tags,” or “web beacons” are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one-pixel GIF, that are placed on a web page, advertisement, or in an email message. The GIF may tell us the IP address of the device that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and it can also identify a previously set cookie value, and how and where a user accessed a website. We may use this information to count visitors across our Service and understand how they navigate and use our Service.
* **Location-Identifying Technologies**. GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to determine your device’s location, sometimes precisely. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.
* **Voice Processing Technologies**. Voice processing technologies collect audio through the microphone on your device to effectuate an instruction or request by you. We only collect audio with your consent. We only maintain the audio long enough to complete your instruction or request and then immediately delete it. We may use non-audio data associated with the collection for additional purposes such as data analytics and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
* **App-Specific Technologies**. Our apps include app-specific technologies, such as SDKs and APIs provided by third parties. An SDK is code embedded in an app that sends information about your use to a server and is in effect the app version of a GIF. The information collected through such technologies often includes your mobile Ad Id.

For further information on how we use Tracking Technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, please see the sections titled **Social Media and Technology Integrations** and **Your Rights and Choices**.

**C. Information from Other Sources**

We also obtain information about you from third party sources. The categories of third-party sources from which we have collected information in the last 12 months include the following:

**6\. CHILDREN’S INFORMATION**
------------------------------

**A. A Note to Parents**

Wizards has developed its Service to be appropriate for a wide range of audiences and not directed to children under 13 (“Children” or “Child”). In general, Children may access the Service only if Wizards has obtained prior verifiable parental consent from their parent or guardian in compliance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (“COPPA”). If you are a parent or guardian, please discuss this Privacy Policy with your Children so that they will better understand how to use the Service and the information they may be asked to provide when using the Service. If you have any questions or comments about how we treat Children’s information or our compliance with COPPA, please contact us as set forth in the section titled **Contact Us** below.

**B. Services Directed to Children**

Wizards may also offer certain areas of the Service that are identified as for Children and on such special areas of our Service we will either provide direct notice to a parent of our collection and use of Children’s personal information as defined by COPPA and obtain prior verifiable parental consent or limit our data collection activities to comply with the obligations of COPPA for Child-directed services. For a list of services that Wizards treats as being directed to Children under COPPA, please contact us as set forth in the section titled **Contact Us**.

**C. Collection, Use, and Sharing of Children's Information**

Wizards may collect, use, and disclose personal information from Children if it is submitted by a Child with prior verifiable parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether prior verifiable parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are Children are either blocked from the activity or taken through a parental consent process. As part of the parental consent process, parents have the choice of consenting to our collection and internal use of their Child’s personal information but prohibiting us from disclosing that information to third parties (except to the extent such disclosure is integral to our Service). If we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected information from a Child in violation of COPPA, we will promptly delete it.

In limited circumstances, in accordance with COPPA, Wizards does not require verifiable parental consent prior to collection, use, or sharing of Children’s personal information. For example, Wizards may collect and store persistent identifiers (e.g., cookies, IP addresses, etc.) from Children without prior verifiable parental consent where we collect no other Children’s personal information and such persistent identifiers are collected solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Service.

Subject to our compliance with COPPA, Wizards may collect personal information from Children for any of the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and may use, disclose, and otherwise process such information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Children’s personal information, including by taking reasonable steps to release such information only to parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security. We retain Children’s personal information only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.

Please refer to the sections titled **Information Collection**, **Information Use**, and **Disclosure of Information** for further details on how we process information.

**D. Parental Access**

A parent or guardian who has already given Wizards permission to collect, use, and disclose their Child’s personal information can, at any time, do the following: (1) review, correct, or delete the Child’s personal information; and/or (2) discontinue further collection, use, or disclosure of the Child’s personal information. To do so, please refer to the confirmation email provided to you when you gave consent or contact us as set forth in the section titled **Contact Us** below. Please be sure to include your Child’s name and email address, your name and email address, and the area of the Service on which your Child is registered.

**7\. SOCIAL MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATIONS**
------------------------------------------------

We offer parts of our Service through websites, locations, platforms, and services operated, owned, or controlled by separate entities. In addition, we integrate technologies operated, owned, or controlled by separate entities into parts of our Service. Some examples include:

* **Links.** Our Service includes links to websites, platforms, and other services not operated or controlled by us.
* **Social Media.** You can engage with our content on or through social networking services, such as Facebook and X. When you engage with our content (such as through our brand page or via our chatbot on Facebook Messenger) or connect your Wizards account to your social media account, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile, such as your name, email address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the ‘likes’ you make. We may also obtain other information such as content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on from your interaction with our content. When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Service, and (3) contact you through the social networking service or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. If you post information on social media that references our Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Wizards in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with our Service. Through some social networking services’ privacy settings, you can control what data you disclose. For more information about how social networking services handle your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of use.
* **Gaming Platforms.** You can connect your Wizards account to your gaming account on another platform, such as Steam or Twitch. This linking may allow us to obtain information such as your gaming username, email address, photo, game performance, and high scores. For more information about how these gaming platforms handle your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of use.

Please note that when you interact with other entities, including when you leave our Service, those entities may independently collect information about you. The information collected and stored by those entities remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they disclose to us, your choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage our users to read third party privacy policies before submitting any information to such third parties.

For further information on Tracking Technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, please see the sections titled **Information Collected Automatically** and **Your Rights and Choices** below.

**8\. ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING**
---------------------------------

We use analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and provide other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. We also work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads for our products and services on other websites and services. As part of this process, we may incorporate Tracking Technologies into our own Service (including our website and emails) as well as into ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these Tracking Technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and other services after you have left the Service (“Interest-based Advertising”).

We also use audience matching services to reach people (or people with similar activity patterns to those people) who have visited our Service or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to a technology service or incorporating a pixel from a technology service into our own Service, and the technology service matching common factors between our data and their data. For instance, we incorporate the Facebook pixel on our Service and may disclose your email address to Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences. Some technology services, such as LiveRamp, may provide us with their own data, which is then uploaded into another technology service for matching common factors between those factors.

For a list of third-party partners whose technologies we have integrated on our site, please click [**here**](https://company.wizards.com/legal/cookies). We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

For further information on the types of Tracking Technologies we use on the Service and your rights and choices regarding analytics, Interest-based Advertising, and Matched Ads, please see the **Information Collected Automatically** and **Your Rights and Choices** sections.

You may exercise choice regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by visiting [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) and downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.

Some of the third parties that collect information from or about you on the Service in order to provide more relevant advertising to you participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising. To learn more about the DAA and your opt-out options for their members, please visit (i) for website opt-out, [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices); and (ii) for mobile app opt-out, [http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices). In addition, some of these third parties may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Opting-out only means that the selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you; it does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).

To opt-out of us using your data for Matched Ads, please contact us as set forth in the **Contact Us** section below and specify that you wish to opt-out of Matched Ads. We will request that the applicable technology service not serve you Matched Ads based on information we provide to it.

Please note that if you opt-out using any of these methods, the opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-party opt-out options or programs, or the accuracy of any company statements regarding their opt-out options or programs.

If you have linked your Wizards account with certain social network or gaming platforms, such as Facebook or Steam, you may unlink your accounts at any time by visiting your Wizards account settings.

**15\. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR DATA SUBJECTS IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ZONE, SWITZERLAND, AND UNITED KINGDOM**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (collectively, “Europe”) provide additional rights to individuals located in those jurisdictions, including through the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). This section addresses those rights and applies only to those individuals.

**A. Roles**

Data protection laws in Europe distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). Wizards acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our websites, emails, and advertisements.

**B. Lawful Basis for Processing**

Data protection laws in Europe require a “lawful basis” for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (1) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers or partners; (2) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (3) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (4) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests.

**C. Your European Privacy Rights**

If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Service. You also have the right to data portability, right to be forgotten, and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Service. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.

To exercise any of these rights, please submit through this [**Form**](https://docs.hasbro.com/privacy_rights). We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.

If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a European supervisory authority.

**D. Children in Europe**

If you are a child under 16 in Europe, you may access the Service only to the extent that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibly over you. Please speak with your parent or guardian about this Privacy Policy so you can better understand how we use your personal data. We make reasonable efforts to verify that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over you, and, if we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal data from you without parental consent, we will promptly delete it.
