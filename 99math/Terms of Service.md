**Introduction**
================

### Welcome to 99math!  
  
99math is a platform for learning and practicing math, motivated by fun gameplay and friendly competition. The platform is owned and controlled by 99math OÜ (Estonian Commercial Registry code 14682374) (“we”).  
  
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) cover the rules according to which you may access and use 99math’s website and app. Using 99math means creating an account, playing the games within, or simply browsing 99math. These Terms specify the rights and obligations of both you and 99math as the parties to an agreement. This in turn allows us to provide you our services and allows you to use them.  
  
Please read these Terms carefully before using 99math. The Terms are legally binding. By using our site and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms without any reservations. If you do not agree with these Terms or any rule within them, then you cannot access and use 99math. You agree and warrant that you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms. You must also keep in mind that your use of 99math must be in accordance with the laws and regulations that apply to you in your own country of residence, wherever that may be.  
  
99math collects and processes your personal data. Please visit our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.99math.com/privacy-policy) for more information on how and why we collect your data or in which cases we may use that data.  
  

**Your Account**
================

### You must create an account to use 99math for its intended purposes. We provide the ability to create three different accounts: a student account, a teacher account and a parent account. Do not share or give others access to your account. Any activity that is made on your account or through it, is considered to be made by you personally.  
  
If you create an account, you agree to provide us with true, complete and accurate information.  
  
You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and password. Remember your password! Keep in mind that we do not ask students for contact information, which in other cases can be used as an additional login option. Therefore, if you have a student account and forget or lose your password, you will be permanently unable to access that account. However if there is a parent account or a teacher account linked with your student account, the parent and the teacher can reset your password.  
  
If you have a student account, then it may be linked with a parent account or a teacher account. If a student account is linked in such a way, the parent can request the deletion of the student account. In that case, 99math will delete the student account permanently.  
  
If you create a parent or a teacher account, you certify that you are at least 18 years old. If you link your parent account or teacher account to a student account, you certify that you are either the parent/legal guardian or teacher of that student.  
  
We have the right to terminate, suspend or disable your account, if you breach any of these Terms in any way. We may do so immediately, without giving prior notice and without any liability arising out of it. When your account is terminated, your right to use 99math will immediately cease.  
  
99math reserves the right to change or replace the system of accounts described in these Terms or the features an account can or cannot use.  
  
If you wish to terminate your account yourself, you may do so by requesting it in writing.  

**Paid Subscription**

You will be billed on each date of renewal until you cancel the Premium account.  

**Refunds & Subscription Cancellation**
=======================================

### You may cancel your Premium account subscription at any time and without giving us a reason. The premium account gives the user access to special content. When you cancel your Premium account, you will lose access to all special content.  
Users have the right to request for a refund during the first 15 days of a subscription. No refunds are offered after that.  
No refunds are issued if your account is terminated by 99math because you have breached these Terms.
