Thus, we do not knowingly collect data about children under the age of 13, except for the data necessary for the functioning of the app (which are listed in section 2. Personal data we collect), therefore we have introduced the verification of the age limit (age gate) as a prevention of the processing of personal data of children under that age. However, this limit may differ in relation to the country in which you live, so please refer to the table below which contains information on the prescribed age of consent in different countries. If a parent or guardian of a child under a certain age becomes aware that his/her child has provided us with data without their consent, he/she should contact us at [dpo@peaksel.com](mailto:dpo@peaksel.com), in order to determine all aspects of such processing and disable the same if necessary.

**9\. Special approvals in some of our products**
-------------------------------------------------

Some of our apps offer you the ability to chat with a virtual character. All our apps that offer such a feature will always ask you for permission to access your device’s microphone in advance. If you choose to give us permission, the virtual character will be able to repeat what you say to it. Please note that our apps do not have a sound recording feature, so what you say to the virtual character is not processed or stored on our servers, and it is used only by the app to play back what you said in real time. If you choose not to give us permission to access the microphone on your device, you will not be able to use the ability to talk to the virtual character while all other features of the games or apps will work without interruption.

**10\. Security of processing** 
--------------------------------

We are taking care of your data privacy. Accordingly, we apply the highest possible level of protection of your data, including technical protection measures such as firewall, encryption, pseudonymization, passwords access restriction, data storage on servers in a local network without internet access to prevent the possibility of unauthorized access, which can be accessed only from a VPN with a certain IP address; physical protection measures such as storing data in special locked rooms with limited access; organizational and personnel measures such as limited access control, adequate training of employees, conclusion of a data confidentiality agreement, all in order to meet the requirements for data processing in accordance with the law, with the aim of ensuring the highest possible degree of protection of your data and minimizing the risk that may arise from the processing of your personal data.

**11\. Automated decision-making**
----------------------------------

As a responsible company, we do not use automated decision-making or automated profiling.

* when your data is anonymized and part of generic data, and you cannot be identified based on it;
* when it is permitted by regulations or is necessary in order to comply with the requirements of competent authorities;

**15\. Additional information for residents of certain countries**
------------------------------------------------------------------

**1\. Residents of Brazil**

In addition to the information contained in the previous sections of this Privacy Policy regarding the processing of your data, the following is additional information related to the processing of Brazilian resident data.

We process your data based on the principle of non-discrimination, therefore we do not process your personal data for unlawful or abusive discriminatory purposes.

In accordance with the regulations that define the age limit for giving consent, we have introduced age verification, therefore we do not knowingly and on purpose collect data about children under the age of 13, except for the data necessary for the functioning of our games and apps specified in section 2 of this Privacy Policy.

If a parent or guardian of a child under a certain age becomes aware that his/her child has provided us with data without their consent, he/she should contact us at [dpo@peaksel.com](mailto:dpo@peaksel.com), in order to determine all aspects of such processing and disable the same if necessary.

We will respond to your possible requests within the deadlines prescribed by the laws that apply to you.

**2\. Residents of the United States of America**

In addition to the information contained in the previous sections of this Privacy Policy regarding the processing of your data, below is additional information related to the processing of data of children under the age of 13, residents of the United States of America to whom the _Children’s online privacy protection rule (COPPA)_ applies.

In an effort to create a healthy and safe environment for children in our games and apps, we do not knowingly and on purpose collect data from children under the age of 13 in our games and apps, except for data necessary for the operation of our games and apps (which are set out in Section 2. Personal data we collect), nor do we use the data of children under this age to deliver personalized advertising materials to them. In order to prevent the collection and processing of data on children under the age of 13, we apply an age gate when logging into our games and apps, so we ask you to provide accurate information regarding your age.

With the aim of fair, transparent and non-deceptive data processing of the users of our games and apps, we have created this Privacy Policy, which is published on our website, which you can also access through the platform through which you download our games and apps, which contains all the information regarding the personal data we collect from our users, including children, how we use such data and whether, when and how we make it available to third parties.

We do not condition the use of our games and apps by providing additional personal data, especially of children, which are not reasonably necessary for the functioning of our products, on the contrary, a person who during age verification, provided information that he is younger than 13 years old, will be able to use our products, although in that case we do not collect his personal data except for the data that are necessary for the functioning of the game or app.

If a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 becomes aware that his/her child has provided us with data without their consent, he/she should contact us at [dpo@peaksel.com](mailto:dpo@peaksel.com)  to determine all aspects of such processing. In that case, the parent has the right to request access to the data provided by his/her child. Also, the parent of a child under the age of 13 has the right at any time to refuse to allow us to further use or collect data from his/her child, and to submit a request to delete data about the child that has been collected up to that time, in which case, we may disable a child from further use of our games or apps.
