Fan Content Policy
==================

We are super happy and excited that players are interested in using Peaksel’s assets and play around with them. However, sometimes people tend to misuse them and try to convince others that various products and/or services are endorsed or sponsored by Peaksel. This can lead to players believing in information, buying stuff or even providing personal information on the basis of that content being official. This makes us very unhappy so we decided to create this Fan Content Policy which governs your use of Peaksel copyrights and trademarks, including any related fan kits provided by us (“Peaksel Assets”) for Fan Content purposes. No warnings will be given for violations of this Policy.

1\. SPECIFIC RULES FOR FAN CONTENT
----------------------------------

**Fan Content Purposes only.** By Fan Content purposes, we mean this: Your use of Peaksel Assets in Fan Content must be limited to displaying, identifying and discussing only Peaksel’s products as permitted by this Policy. You cannot create new products or content based on Peaksel Assets, such as games based on the game characters created by Peaksel, not even if they were free. Permitted Fan Content normally includes for example non-commercial fan-generated online guides and guide apps, fan pages and gameplay videos as long as they follow this Policy.

**For YouTubers.** You are allowed to use Peaksel Assets and gameplay videos for your own Fan Content so long as you follow this policy and include Google Play and App Store links of the games/apps in the first two lines of your video description. You can’t modify Peaksel Assets without our express permission. This doesn’t apply to the game with the title “[100 Doors: Escape from School](https://peaksel.com/casual-games/100-doors-games/)“. This game is not allowed to be recorded and shared (including posting solutions to the game in any shape or form, be it written or visual), because of its nature.

**Be non-commercial.** You are not permitted to charge a fee of any kind (including in-app functionalities) from customers or visitors to your Fan Content, unless this has expressly been approved by Peaksel. You may, however, generally monetize your Fan Content by using advertisements. If you use ads, they must comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and developer policies.

**Respect Peaksel’s brand.** You cannot create the impression that Peaksel is a sponsor or creator of or otherwise endorses your Fan Content. You also cannot create any materials from the Peaksel Assets that are similar to Peaksel’s logos, trademarks or other elements of Peaksel’s products and services. You can’t modify Peaksel Assets without our express permission.

**Keep it online.** You are not permitted to manufacture or distribute (for free or otherwise) physical items such as T-shirts that bear any Peaksel Assets or other Peaksel intellectual property without a separate, express written agreement between you and Peaksel.

**No novels, theatricals or the like.** You are not permitted to write, produce or create any novels, theatrical productions or other adaptations that include Peaksel’s intellectual property without our express written permission.

**Insert disclaimers.** Do include the following notice (or similar disclaimers) in a font legible to end users of the Fan Content in connection with your use of Peaksel Assets: “This content is not affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored, or specifically approved by Peaksel and Peaksel is not responsible for it. For more information see Peaksel’s Fan Content Policy: [https://dev.peaksel.com/fan-content-policy/](https://dev.peaksel.com/fan-content-policy/) .”

**No domains or the like.** You can’t register domain names, social media accounts or related addresses for your Fan Content which include Peaksel’s trademarks without a separate written agreement with us.

**No bad stuff.** The Peaksel Assets may not be used on or in connection with any Fan Content that (i) promotes hacks or cheats, sexually suggestive materials, violence, discrimination or illegal activities, (ii) promotes other game companies, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, pornography, weapons, gambling, or companies or services that act contrary to Peaksel’s interests, (iii) makes disparaging, libelous or dishonest statements about Peaksel and/or its products, employees and agents, (iv) makes clearly false promises, like click-baits or in other ways presents misleading materials or (v) contains other objectionable content.

**2\. ADDITIONAL TERMS**
------------------------

Developer policies and agreements. Respecting the rules of the platform or channel you choose to share your Fan Content on is very important to Peaksel. You must always follow applicable developer policies and agreements in force from time to time.

Our use of your Fan Content. We may from time to time use your Fan Content without compensation in a manner we consider reasonable, for example by reposting it in our online channels or otherwise using it in our marketing activities.

Unpublished information and feedback. If you receive information from us regarding not-yet-published content, you need to keep that information to yourself and not disclose it to anyone else. Also, if you give us any kind of feedback, information or suggestions regarding our games or otherwise, you understand that we can use it without further compensation or other obligations to you.

We reserve the right to determine what type of Fan Content we are OK with and may revoke the limited use license in this Policy at any time and for any reason.

We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time. When using Peaksel Assets for Fan Content purposes, your use is subject to this policy.
