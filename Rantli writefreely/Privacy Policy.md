Privacy Policy
==============

Last updated December 21, 2022

[WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/), the software that powers this site, is built to enforce your right to privacy by default.

It retains as little data about you as possible, not even requiring an email address to sign up. However, if you _do_ give us your email address, it is stored encrypted in our database. We salt and hash your account's password.

We temporarily store log files, or data about what happens on the server. We also use cookies to keep you logged in to your account.

Beyond this, it's important that you trust whoever runs **Rant.li**. Software can only do so much to protect you â€” your level of privacy protections will ultimately fall on whoever runs this particular service.
