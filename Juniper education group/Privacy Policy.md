|     |     |

| Withdraw consent | Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. |
| Rectification | The right to require us to correct any mistakes in your personal data. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. |
| To be forgotten | The right to require us to delete your personal data in certain situations. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. |
| Restriction of processing | Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:  <br><br>* If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy. <br>* Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it. <br>* Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. <br>* You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. |
| Data portability | Request the transfer of your personal data to you or a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. |
| To object | Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes without consent. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. |
| Not to be subject to automated individual decision making | The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. |

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact **[DPO@junipereducation.org](mailto:DPO@junipereducation.org)** 

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.  We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure you have a right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.  We try to respond to all requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
