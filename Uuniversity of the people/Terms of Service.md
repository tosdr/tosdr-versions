The University of the People Web Site may contain bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with the public at large or with a group (collectively, “Communication Services”). You agree to use the Communication Services only to post, send and receive messages and material that are proper and related to the particular Communication Service. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using a Communication Service, you will not:

* Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others.
* Publish, post, upload, distribute or disseminate any inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful topic, name, material or information.
* Upload files that contain software or other material protected by intellectual property laws (or by rights of privacy or publicity) unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents.
* Upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of the University of the People Web Site, University of the People’s network, or another’s computer.
* Advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any business purpose, unless such Communication Service specifically allows such messages.
* Conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters.
* Download any file posted by another user of a Communication Service that you know, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally distributed in such manner.
* Falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper notices or proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of software or other material contained in a file that is uploaded.
* Restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Communication Services.
* Violate any code of conduct or other guidelines which may be applicable for any particular Communication Service.
* Harvest or otherwise collect information about others, including e-mail addresses, without their consent.

University of the People has no obligation to monitor any messages, content, or any other aspect of the Communication Services.

University of the People reserves the right to terminate your access to any or all of the Communication Services at any time without notice for any reason whatsoever.

Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable information about yourself, your children or other persons in any Communication Service. University of the People does not endorse the content, messages or information found in any Communication Service and, therefore, University of the People specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Service. Managers and hosts are not authorized University of the People spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of University of the People.

Materials uploaded to a Communication Service may be subject to posted limitations on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you download the materials.

MATERIALS PROVIDED TO University of the People OR POSTED AT THE University of the People WEB SITE

University of the People does not claim ownership of the materials you provide to University of the People (including feedback and suggestions) or post, upload, input or submit to the University of the People Web Site (collectively “Submissions”). However, by posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your Submission you are granting University of the People and its sublicensees permission to use your Submission in connection with University of the People’s operations including, without limitation, the rights to: copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, reproduce, edit, translate and reformat your Submission; and to publish your name in connection with your Submission.

No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Submission. University of the People is under no obligation to post or use any Submission you may provide and may remove any Submission at any time in University of the People’s sole discretion.

By posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your Submission you warrant and represent that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission including, without limitation, all the rights necessary for you to provide, post, upload, input or submit the Submissions.
