Privacy Policy
==============

Effective Date: December 18, 2023
---------------------------------

Please note that Nelnet Business Solutions, Inc. (d/b/a FACTS Management Company) (hereinafter, as “**FACTS**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “us”) offers Services related to education, including tuition management, payment administration and processing, financial needs assessment, school management, online application, and online enrollment. To provide these Services, we may store and maintain information about educational institutions (or other entities) we serve, along with personal information regarding administrators, staff members, parents/guardians, and students. Access to the data will be restricted to authorized associates and will be used only for the purpose of providing Services to you or the Institution.

Web Privacy Policy
------------------

This Web Privacy Policy (“**Web Privacy Policy**”) is designed to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of products and services (individually and collectively, the “**Services**”) through our websites (“**Website**”), as well as from users of FACTS’ Management’s mobile device application(s) via the Services. This Web Privacy Policy applies to users when visiting the Website or receiving the Services.

We are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience. This Web Privacy Policy explains our collection and use practices regarding consumer information, including how and what we share with our related companies and with unrelated entities. Protecting your privacy is important to FACTS Management and our employees. We want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it.

This Web Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time, so be sure to check back occasionally to ensure you have read the most current version. It is effective as of the date listed above and applies to our Services that link to this Web Privacy Policy. Even if you read and/or agreed to a prior privacy statement, you need to review this updated version. We reserve the right at any time, and in our sole discretion, to change or modify this Web Privacy Policy. If any such changes or modifications are made, we will update the “Effective Date” appearing at the top of this web page. Such changes or modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to the Website, and supersede any prior versions of this Web Privacy Policy.

Information We Obtain
---------------------

We may obtain certain personal information in connection with the Website or the Services, including:

* Contact information, such as name, email and postal address, and phone number;
* Login credentials, such as username and password
* Demographic information, such as date of birth, gender identification
* Payment card information, including card number and expiration date
* Bank account information, such as account number and routing number
* Government-issued identifiers, such as social security number, driver’s license number
* Education-related information, such as student Identification number, student behavior information, grades or transcripts
* Other documents, information, or content that you upload to the Site or information requested in connection with the Services such as medical information, tax-related information, photos, religious affiliation

We may collect such information about you from the following sources:

* Information from this Website or paper forms
* Information about your transactions with us or others
* Information we receive from third parties, such as your academic institution

### Why We Collect Information

We collect information so we can identify you as our customer, to establish, manage and protect your accounts, to complete your transactions, to create and offer you products and services you might be interested in, to personalize and improve upon your experience with us and to comply with various legal and regulatory requirements.

### Non-Identifying Information

We may collect information from your visit or as part of the registration and administration of your account, in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, such as, without limitation, age and individual preferences (“**Non-Identifying Information**”).

### Cookies

The Services may place “**Cookies**” on a visitor’s device. Cookies are small text files. Our Cookies save anonymized data about individual visitors, allowing our Services to recognize information about a visitor and help deliver personalized content and other services and functions. Cookies make your Internet experience quicker and more convenient. The Services use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user’s device until they expire or are manually deleted. The Services also contain coding from our business and technology partners which generates third party cookies. Third party cookies allow our business and technology partners to store Non-Identifying Information they can access when you visit this or other websites. Accepting a cookie from a web or device browser may give us access to personal information for analytics purposes.

Most website and mobile device browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and provide the ability to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. Blocking cookies may result in a lower quality experience for you while you are using our Services.

### Device and Connection Information

When you use our Services, we may identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or handheld device. The IP address does not identify you personally, but it lets us identify the device you are using. We store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes. We may also collect other device-specific information about the device you are using, including what type of device it is and hardware model, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifies, geo-location data, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. Check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn more about what information your device makes available to us.

### Web Beacons (1×1 Pixels or GIFS)

Our Services may contain coding known as Web Beacons that use 1×1 pixel images to capture and transmit the online activity of users on our Services. These Web Beacons typically transmit information about form completions and other activities in order to measure advertising effectiveness or store analytics information. In addition, we may use Web Beacons in HTML-based emails. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our email communications and our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients have opened.

### Log Files

Like most websites, our servers utilize log files. Log files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. Log files are used to analyze trends, administer the Website, track Users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use log file information at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our website.

### Google Analytics Feature

We may use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the Website. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Website by [disabling the Google Analytics cookie](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) on your browser. You can also view and change the [currently available opt-outs](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en) for Google Ads.

### Other Analytics Tools

In addition to or in lieu of Google Analytics, we may use other similar web analytics tools to collect information about our Website. Regardless of the tool selected, we use this information only to improve the Website. Any analytics tools we use collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, your name and email address.

### Google Drive

If you choose to link your Google Drive account to a FACTS product for easy access to your files, FACTS may use Google’s OAuth protocols to establish that connection. FACTS will not use this information in any manner inconsistent with this Web Privacy Policy or for any purpose other than allowing you access to your Google Drive. FACTS will not read, edit, delete, or copy files or information without your permission or as instructed by you. You may disconnect FACTS’ site or application at any time by removing access through your Google account.

### Do Not Track Signals

Do Not Track is a feature in your web browser, which enables you to opt-out of the third party tracking of your online activities over time and across third party websites. We do not track users across third party websites to provide targeted advertising, and therefore, do not process or comply with any web browser’s “do not track” signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit this Website or use our Services. Third parties cannot collect any personal information from this Website unless you provide it to them directly.

Uses of Information
-------------------

We may use your personal information and aggregate it with information collected from other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the services and to analyze and understand how our Website and Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

If you supply us with your e-mail address, we may let you know by e-mail about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. You will have the opportunity to tell us you do not want to receive future messages with each message you receive. If you e-mail a question or comment to us, we will use your e-mail address to reply to you and we will temporarily store your e-mail address, your message, and our reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations. When we collect your e-mail address this way, we will not use it for marketing our products and services unless you have given us permission.

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Website-related Services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Website’s features) to assist us in analyzing how our Website and Services are used, or to perform other services (e.g., without limitation, sending postal mail and email, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service). These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf; provided, however, that if you are redirected to a site or application maintained by a third party, the privacy policy of such site or application will control the use of any information you provide.

We may share your information with companies that are affiliated with us, such as our direct or indirect subsidiaries or parent or sister companies. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell companies, subsidiaries, or business units. Your Personal Information may be included as an asset in connection with mergers, acquisitions, reorganizations, or sales of assets including in the event of bankruptcy.

Sometimes the law or other circumstances also require that we disclose Personal Information about you to nonaffiliated third parties. Some examples are: when you ask or permit us to do so; in response to subpoenas or court orders; when we suspect fraud or criminal activity; to protect our property and rights or those of a third party; to protect the safety of the public or any person; or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.

Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your personal information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your personal information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Website and Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

We may use your personal information to send you information about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. We may also share your information with our affiliates to market financial products and services to you. You will have the opportunity to tell us you do not want to receive future messages with each message you receive. You may also opt out of receiving marketing materials by visiting the [FACTS unsubscribe page](https://info.factsmgt.com/unsubscribe/u/736583). If you wish to change any of your personal information, you may change it by logging into your account; by contacting Customer Service, either through email, mail, or telephone; or by contacting your Educational Institution.

### What We Share

We do not sell personal information to third parties. All personal information collected is used by us or our affiliates to perform services, send you information about new products and services, comply with laws or carry out internal functions.

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Website-related Services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Website’s features) to assist us in analyzing how our Website and Services are used, or to perform other services (e.g., without limitation, sending postal mail and email, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service). These third parties may have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf; provided, however, that if you are redirected to a site or application maintained by a third party, the privacy policy of such site or application will control the use of any information you provide.

Your personal information may be included as an asset in connection with mergers, acquisitions, reorganizations, or sales of assets including in the event of bankruptcy.

Links to Other Websites and Services
------------------------------------

We are not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose websites may contain links to the Website, including vendors where you may shop. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another website, our Web Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third party website or service are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. Please note that when you shop with a vendor who is linked to the Website, even though you may have started your visit with us, and even though our pages may still appear, your transactions are completed with a separate organization, not with us.
