Mobile Phone Unlocking
----------------------

Kroger Wireless will automatically unlock Kroger Wireless phones purchased from The Kroger Family of Co. stores no later than _one year_ after initial activation, for customers that are in full compliance with Kroger Wireless’ [**Terms & Conditions**](https://www.krogeriwireless.com/support/terms-and-conditions)(“T&Cs”). 

If you have questions about the status of a handset unlock request, you may contact Kroger Wireless Customer Service by calling 866-434-7796 or visit [**https://www.krogerwireless.com/contact-us**](https://www.krogerwireless.com/contact-us).  You must provide:

* The phone number of the handset
* The name on the account
* The 4-6 digit account passcode

For deployed military personnel who are in full compliance with Kroger Wireless’ Terms of Service, Kroger Wireless will unlock mobile phones upon receiving valid copies of deployment papers.  
  
Devices that work on Kroger Wireless’ network may not be compatible with other carriers’ networks due to the use of different frequencies and technologies to provide wireless network access. “Unlocking,” as used herein, refers only to the disabling of software that prevents the activation of a device designed for Kroger Wireless’ network from being used on another carrier’s technologically compatible network. It does not pertain to hardware changes and does not guarantee that the Kroger Wireless phone will be compatible with any particular carrier’s network or that all functionality of the device can be enabled on any other network.

**Kroger Wireless may refuse any unlock request that would result in an abuse of these policies or is part of an effort to defraud Kroger Wireless or its customers. These policies are subject to change at Kroger Wireless’ discretion and without advance notice.**
