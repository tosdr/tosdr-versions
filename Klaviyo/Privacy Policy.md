**2.2** With respect to Customer Affiliates, by entering into the Agreement Customer warrants it is duly authorized to enter into this DPA for and on behalf of any such Customer Affiliates and, subject to clause 2.3, each Customer Affiliate shall be bound by the terms of this DPA as if they were the Customer.

**2.3** Customer warrants that it is duly mandated by any Customer Affiliates on whose behalf Klaviyo processes Customer Personal Data in accordance with this DPA to (a) enforce the terms of this DPA on behalf of the Customer Affiliates, and to act on behalf of the Customer Affiliates in the administration and conduct of any claims arising in connection with this DPA; and (b) receive and respond to any notices or communications under this DPA on behalf of Customer Affiliates.

**2.4** The Parties agree that any notice or communication sent by Klaviyo to Customer shall satisfy any obligation to send such notice or communication to a Customer Affiliate.

#### **3\. ROLE OF THE PARTIES**

**3.1** The Parties acknowledge and agree that:

　　**(i)** In general, Customer functions as a controller, whereas Klaviyo functions as a processor.

　　**(ii)** In certain cases, Customer functions as a processor on behalf of Customer’s customers where Customer and Customer’s customer have concluded a data processing agreement in relation to the processing of Personal Data of Customer’s customers; and 

　**(b)** for the purposes of the US Data Protection Laws, Klaviyo will act as a “**service provider**” or “**processor**” in its performance of its obligations pursuant to the Agreement.

　**(c)** Account Information, shall not be governed by this DPA and shall be subject to Klaviyo’s Privacy Notice.

#### **4\. DETAILS OF DATA PROCESSING**

**4.1** The details of data processing (such as subject matter, nature and purpose of the processing, categories of Personal Data and data subjects) are described in the Agreement and in Schedule 1.

**4.2** Customer Personal Data will only be processed on behalf of and under the instructions of Customer and in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Laws. The Agreement and this DPA shall be Customer’s instructions for the processing of Customer Personal Data. Customer may issue further written instructions in accordance with this DPA. 

**4.3** If Customer’s instructions will cause Klaviyo to process Customer Personal Data in violation of Applicable Data Protection Laws or outside the scope of the Agreement or the DPA, Klaviyo shall promptly inform Customer thereof, unless prohibited by Applicable Data Protection Laws (without prejudice to the SCCs).

**4.4** Klaviyo may store and process Customer Personal Data anywhere Klaviyo or its Sub-processors maintain facilities, subject to clause 5 of this DPA.

#### **5\. SUB-PROCESSORS**

**5.1** Customer grants Klaviyo general authorization to engage Sub-processors, subject to clause 5.2, from an agreed list, as well as Klaviyo’s current Sub-processors listed at [https://www.klaviyo.com/legal/subprocessors](https://www.klaviyo.com/legal/subprocessors) as of the Effective Date.

**5.2** Klaviyo shall (i) enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor imposing data protection obligations no less protective of Customer Personal Data than Klaviyo’s obligations under this DPA to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by such Sub-processor; and (ii) remain liable for each Sub-processor’s compliance with the obligations under this DPA.

**5.3** Klaviyo shall provide Customer with at least fifteen (15) days’ notice of any proposed changes to the Sub-processors it uses to process Customer Personal Data (including any addition or replacement of any Sub-processors). Customer may reasonably object to Klaviyo’s use of a new Sub-processor (including when exercising its right to object under clause 9(a) of the SCCs) by providing Klaviyo with written notice of the objection within ten (10) days after Klaviyo has provided notice to Customer of such proposed change (an “**Objection**”). In the event Customer objects to Klaviyo’s use of a new Sub-processor, Customer and Klaviyo will work together in good faith to find a mutually acceptable resolution to address such Objection. If the parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution within a reasonable timeframe, either party may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the Agreement by providing written notice to the other party. During any such Objection period, Klaviyo may suspend the affected portion of the Services.

#### **6\. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS REQUESTS**

**6.1** As between the Parties, Customer shall have sole discretion and responsibility in responding to the rights asserted by any individual in relation to Customer Personal Data (“**Data Subject Request**”).

**6.2** Klaviyo will forward to Customer without undue delay any Data Subject Request received by Klaviyo or any Sub-processor from an individual in relation to their Customer Personal Data and may advise the individual to submit their request directly to Customer.
