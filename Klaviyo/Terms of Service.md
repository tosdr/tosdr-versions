Terms & Conditions
==================

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Klaviyo Community! The Klaviyo Community provides a place to discuss all things Klaviyo. The following terms are presented here so you know what is expected of you and what you can expect from fellow users.

These Terms of Use (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the Klaviyo Community forum (the “**Community**”). By accessing and using the Community, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Klaviyo, Inc. (“**we**,” “**us**,” or “**Klaviyo**”), the company that runs the Community, may offer other products and services under different terms and conditions. These Terms apply only to the use of the Community, and Klaviyo reserves the right to modify these Terms from time to time by posting an updated version on the Community. Any updated version will become effective when posted. If you do not agree to any modified Terms, you may cease using the Community. Your continued use of the Community after such modification will constitute your acceptance of the modified Terms.

1\. General Guidelines
