Api terms

API Terms of Use
================

Updated: July 20, 2020

Thank you for using Klaviyo’s publicly available application program interfaces (“**APIs**“). These API Terms of Use (the “**API Terms**“) describe your rights and responsibilities when accessing our APIs and related [API documentation](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en). By accessing our APIs and [API documentation](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en), you agree to these API Terms and our [Terms of Service](https://www.klaviyo.com/legal/terms-of-service). These API Terms form a part of our [Terms of Service](https://www.klaviyo.com/legal/terms-of-service) and capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in these API Terms have the meanings given to them in our [Terms of Service](https://www.klaviyo.com/legal/terms-of-service).

PLEASE READ THESE API TERMS CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE API TERMS, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS OUR APIS. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE TERMS OF THESE API TERMS, PLEASE CONTACT US AT LEGAL@KLAVIYO.COM.

Under these API Terms, “Klaviyo” means Klaviyo, Inc., and we may refer to Klaviyo as “we,” “our,” or “us.”

#### **Account/Registration**

You may not use our APIs and may not accept these API Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries. If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to these API Terms, you are accepting these API Terms on behalf of that entity, and all references to “you” in these API Terms refer to that entity. In order to access certain APIs you may be required to register and provide certain information about yourself as part of the registration process or as part of your continued use of the APIs. You may not make credentials available to others including by embedding them in open source projects and you may only access the APIs with the credentials provided to you. You may not misrepresent or mask your identity or your credentials when accessing or using the APIs. All registration information you provide must be accurate and up to date at all times. You will inform us promptly of any updates.

#### **Access to our APIs**

Subject to the restrictions below, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, non-transferable, revocable license to access our APIs and [API documentation](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en) for sole purposes of developing, testing and supporting software, services, or modules that connect to products, software, websites and/or services offered by Klaviyo (the “**Offerings**”) or have access to the data within our Offerings (an “**Integration**”). You may charge for your Integration; however, you may not sell, rent, lease, sublicense, redistribute, or syndicate access to any of our APIs. We may terminate your access to our APIs at any time for any reason.

You will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and third party rights (including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, and local laws). You will not use our APIs to (a) encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights; (b) modify or make derivative works based upon the APIs; (c) improperly use the APIs, including creating Internet “links” to the APIs, “framing” or “mirroring” any part of the APIs on any other websites or systems, or “scraping” or otherwise improperly obtaining data from the APIs; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, modify, or disassemble the APIs; (e) send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages with the APIs; (f) use the APIs to (x) display any offensive content or any content for which you do not have the right to share with Klaviyo or to display or (y) distribute unsolicited advertising or promotions, or initiate any other communication or contact with Klaviyo users or partners or (g) violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.klaviyo.com/legal/terms-of-service) or our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.klaviyo.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy).

In addition, you shall not, and shall not direct, encourage, or assist any other party to, access or use the APIs to: (i) design or develop a competitive or substantially similar product or service; (ii) copy or extract any features or functionality thereof; (iii) launch or cause to be launched on or in connection with the APIs a malicious automated program or script, including web spiders, crawlers, robots, indexers, bots, viruses or worms, or any program intended to overburden or hinder the operation and/or performance of the APIs; (iv) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the APIs or its related systems or networks; (v) include any underlying Offering with competitors in any aggregated view i.e. webpage, app, software, etc.; (vi) aggregate Klaviyo’s data with competitors’ data; or (vii) parse or scrape any of Klaviyo’s data; in each case other than as explicitly permitted by Klaviyo in writing.

You will only access (or attempt to access) our APIs by the means described in our [API documentation](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en). We may set and enforce limits on your use of our APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make) in our sole discretion. You agree not to circumvent any limitations documented with our APIs. We may monitor your use of our APIs for reasons including to improve our APIs and for compliance with these API Terms. We may suspend your access to our APIs without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of these API Terms. Klaviyo may collect and use usage data and information related to your use of the APIs.

These API Terms are non-exclusive. You agree not to access our APIs in order to compete with our Offerings.

If you offer your application for use by others outside of your entity, you must maintain a user agreement and a legally compliant privacy policy for your application that is prominently identified or located where users download or access your application. You must immediately notify us in writing of any breach of your user agreement or privacy policy that impacts, or may impact, customers or users of our Offerings.

You are solely responsible for all costs incurred by you in the creation and maintenance of the Integrations.

You are solely responsible for selecting all content made available through and contained in the Integrations and for ensuring that such content complies with the API Terms and our [Terms of Service](https://www.klaviyo.com/legal/terms-of-service) and any other requirements applicable to such content. You are fully responsible for any information you provide to Klaviyo via the APIs.

#### **Privacy and Security**

You agree to comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personally identifiable information (“**PII**”). You agree to provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your Integrations that clearly and accurately describes to users of your Integrations what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with us and third parties. You agree to obtain express permission from users before you access their Klaviyo accounts. You agree to immediately delete a user’s data if the user requests deletion or terminates their account with you.

You agree to implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect all user data, including PII, from unauthorized access, use loss, destruction, damage, alteration, or disclosure in the same manner that you would protect your own confidential and proprietary information but in no event using less than a reasonable degree of care and you agree to notify both us and your users of any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required under applicable law. In the event of a security deficiency or incident, outage, or any other event that may impact or compromise our users, APIs, or Service, you agree to work with us immediately to assess and remedy the situation. You also agree to coordinate with us on any public statements before publication.

If your use of the APIs requires or will likely result in the provision of personal information directly to Klaviyo, you agree to adequately inform and obtain all necessary consents and authorizations from the applicable users to provide such personal information to Klaviyo and retain written records of such consents.

We reserve the right to audit, or to appoint an independent auditor under appropriate non-disclosure conditions to audit, your Integration, systems and records to confirm your compliance with these API Terms. If requested, you must provide us with proof that your Integration complies with these API Terms.

#### **Ownership and Proprietary Rights**

Klaviyo owns all right, title and interest, including without limitation, all intellectual property rights and other rights in and to its Offerings, the APIs, any intellectual property rights used in connection with the Offerings or APIs, and other proprietary technology, including any data structures therein, accompanying documentation, and any updates or revisions to the foregoing.

You retain your ownership rights in your Integrations. All of our rights not expressly granted by these API Terms are hereby retained.

If you provide us with feedback or suggestions about our APIs (“**Feedback**”), then we may use such information and you grant us an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use any such Feedback for any purpose without any obligation or compensation to you.

#### **Trademarks**

You may not use the Klaviyo brand or marks outside of what is expressed in our [Newsroom](https://www.klaviyo.com/newsroom). You may not alter or remove any proprietary notices in our marks. You may not use the Klaviyo brand in any way that suggests that Klaviyo sponsors, endorses, or associates with your Integration without prior written consent.

You grant us the right to (1) produce and distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, videos, or other content from your Integrations and (2) use your company name and logo for marketing or promotional purposes on our website and in other public or private communications with our existing or potential developers and customers; you hereby grant us all necessary licenses, on a royalty-free basis, for these purposes.

#### **Updates**

Our APIs may evolve and change over time. While we do our best to notify developers of major changes in advance, we reserve the right to modify our APIs, cease to offer support for our APIs, or require you to use our APIs in a different manner at any time without notice.

We may update these API Terms from time to time by posting an updated version to www.klaviyo.com/legal/api-terms and any such updates will be effective upon posting. When we update these API Terms, the “Updated” date above will be updated to reflect the date of the most recent version. Your continued use of our APIs constitutes your acceptance of the modified API Terms. We encourage you to review these API Terms regularly.

#### **Confidentiality**
