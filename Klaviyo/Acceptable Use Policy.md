Acceptable use policy

Acceptable Use Policy
=====================

Updated: September 24, 2021

Here at Klaviyo, our mission is to help businesses grow. To do this, we need to keep our products and services running smoothly and without distraction, and we need the members of our community not to misuse or abuse them. There are some activities that are incompatible with Klaviyo’s mission to help businesses grow, and this Acceptable Use Policy describes those prohibited activities in detail.

This Acceptable Use Policy (this “**Policy**“) applies to the use of any product, service or website provided by Klaviyo (collectively, the “**Services**“), whether we provide it directly or a partner of ours provides it to you. By using any of the Services, you are agreeing to this Policy. The examples described in this Policy are not exhaustive. Capitalized terms used below but not defined in this Policy have the meanings set forth in our [Terms of Service](https://www.klaviyo.com/legal/terms-of-service).

• Overwhelm or attempt to overwhelm our infrastructure by imposing an unreasonably large load on the Services that consume extraordinary resources, such as by: (i) using “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers” or other automated systems to send more request messages to our servers than a person could reasonably send in the same period of time using a normal browser; or (ii) going far beyond the use parameters for the Services;

• Use meta tags or any other “hidden text” including Klaviyo’s or our suppliers’ product names or trademarks;
