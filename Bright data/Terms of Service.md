====================================

_Last Updated July 12, 2023_

This Master Service Agreement (the “**Agreement**”) is an agreement between Bright Data Ltd., (“**Bright Data**”) with address at 4 Hamahshev St., Netanya 4250714, Israel, and you or the entity you represent (“**Client**”). This Agreement takes effect when you sign up to Bright Data or, if earlier, when you access or use the Bright Data services, as defined below (the “**Effective Date**”). If you are using the Bright Data services on behalf of an entity, you represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into this Agreement on behalf of the Client.

#### Bright Data Responsibilities

1\. **Bright Data Responsibilities**

1. Bright Data will make any of the services detailed in this Agreement or otherwise offered on the Bright Data platforms (“**the Services**”) available to Client in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, including Bright Data’s [Service Level Agreement](https://brightdata.com/sla), if applicable. Bright Data shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor Client’s use of the Service for billing purposes and to verify no misuse or network abuse. Bright Data may share the Client’s relevant information with any authority in case of a complaint, investigation or a lawsuit, if Bright Data determines that it is necessary to comply with any subpoena, judicial or governmental requirement, or order.
2. Certain Services will be made available subject to Bright Data’s completion of a successful compliance review process of the Client. Such review may include a Know Your Client process, video calls with the Client and any other measures that Bright Data decides, at its sole discretion, are necessary to approve Client’s use of the Service. Client will cooperate with Bright Data and provide it with any information reasonably required as part of the compliance review process.

#### Temporary Suspension

2\. **Temporary Suspension**.

Bright Data in its sole discretion and at any time, may suspend Client’s right to access or use the Service immediately upon notice to Client if Bright Data, at its sole discretion, determines that:

1. Client’s use of or registration to the Service (i) poses a security risk to Bright Data or its Service or any third party, (ii) may adversely impact Bright Data or any of its clients, including by way of causing a user to be blocked from certain websites, networks or services, (iii) may subject Bright Data, its affiliates, or any third party to liability, or is in breach under any applicable laws or regulations, (iv) may be fraudulent, or (v) may disparage or devalue Bright Data’s reputation or goodwill; or
2. Client is in breach of this Agreement, including if Client is delinquent on payment obligations; or
3. Client has violated any of its representations and warranties under this Agreement or any other representation and warranties provided to Bright Data associated with Client’s use of the Service.

#### Client Warranties and Representations

3\. **Client Warranties and Representations.**

The Client warrants, represents and covenants to Bright Data that:

General

1. It is aware that the Services may only be used by individuals that are at least 18 years old and at least the legal age allowed for by the applicable jurisdiction. The Client represents and warrants that, to the extent it is an individual, it is of legal age, as described above. Client further acknowledges that Bright Data may require proof of age as a condition for the provision of the Service.
2. To the extent that the use of the Service will contain any personal information, that is intended for processing by Bright Data as a “processor” (as the term is defined in the applicable privacy legislation) then the provision of the Service will also be subject to [Data Protection Addendum](https://brightdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bright-Data-Data-Protection-Agreement.pdf).
3. The Client will be solely responsible for any actions it performs based on the use of the Service.
4. The Client is responsible for protecting its personal username and/or password to the Service. The Client may not share its account privileges with anyone or knowingly permit any unauthorized access to the Service. The accounts of those involved will be disabled if sharing is detected.
5. The Client shall not use the Services in violation of applicable law or regulations or any third party rights (including intellectual property rights) and not use the Service in any manner or for any purpose other than as stated in the intended use case provided to Bright Data, if applicable.
6. Without derogating from the generality of the above, the Client will only use the Service in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://brightdata.com/acceptable-use-policy), as may be amended from time to time.
7. Specific terms for the Proxy Services  
     When using the Proxy Services, the Client shall:  
    I.

2. The Receiving Party shall use at least the same degree of care to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure or access that the Receiving Party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but not less than reasonable care, including measures to protect against the unauthorized use, access, destruction, loss and alteration of such Confidential Information;
3. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement shall be made available by the Receiving Party to any third party for any purpose, except to a consultant, attorney, subcontractor, or potential subcontractor who needs to know the Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement and provided that they agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Article or another written agreement sufficient to require them to treat Confidential Information in accordance with this Agreement. The Receiving Party agrees to indemnify the Disclosing Party for any violation or breach of such restrictions.

**“Confidential Information”** shall mean all information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party in connection with the Agreement, whether in oral form, visual form or in writing, including but not limited to: all specifications, formulas, prototypes, computer programs and any and all records, data, ideas, methods, techniques, processes and projections, plans, marketing information, materials, creatives, scripts and storyboards, financial statements, memoranda, analyses, notes, legal documents and other data and information (in whatever form), as well as improvements, patents (whether pending or duly registered), trade secrets, any know-how, customer lists, customer information, end-user information, and any information provided to the Disclosing Party by a third party under a confidentiality agreement or which the Disclosing Party is otherwise legally obligated to keep in confidence, relating to the Disclosing Party, and information learned by the Receiving Party from the Disclosing Party through inspection of Disclosing Party’s property, that relates to the Disclosing Party’s products, designs, business plans, business opportunities, finances, research, development, know-how or personnel.

Confidential Information will not include:

1. Information that the Receiving Party received rightfully from a third party who has the right to transfer or disclose it, without default or breach of this Agreement; or
2. Information that was previously rightfully known by the Receiving Party free of any obligation to keep it confidential; or
3. Information that becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Receiving Party; or
4. Information that is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to, use of, or access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a subpoena, judicial or governmental requirement, or order, and the Receiving Party shall not be liable in damages for any such disclosure of Confidential Information.  
The confidentiality obligations under this Agreement will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

#### Disclaimer of Warranties

6\. **Disclaimer of Warranties**. BRIGHT DATA IS PROVIDING THE USE OF THE SERVICE AND ANY ACCOMPANYING DATA ON “AS IS” BASIS AND IT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED TO THE CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY OF THE SERVICE OR ANY ACCOMPANYING DATA, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SECURITY, ACCURACY, ABSENCE OF VIRUSES OR ANY DEFECT THEREIN, WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE.

#### Limitation of Liability

7\. **Limitation of Liability**. In no event will Bright Data be liable under this Agreement for any consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages or for any loss, profits or revenue (whether in contract, tort, negligence or any other legal theory) in any way relating to this Agreement (“**Event**”), even if Bright Data had been informed in advance of the possibility of such damages. Bright Data’s aggregated liability under this Agreement for any claim or damage or series of such is limited to the amount of fees actually received by Bright Data from Client under this Agreement during the one month period prior to the Event.

#### Indemnification

8\. **Indemnification**. Client will defend Bright Data against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Bright Data by a third party alleging that the Client’s use of any Service infringes or misappropriates such third party’s intellectual property rights or breaches applicable privacy laws or any other applicable law or causes damage to such third party (a “**Claim Against Bright Data**”), and will indemnify Bright Data from any direct damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against Bright Data as a result of, or for any amounts paid by Bright Data under a court-approved settlement of, a Claim Against Bright Data, provided Bright Data (a) promptly gives Client written notice of the Claim Against Bright Data, (b) gives Client sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against Bright Data (except that Client may not settle any Claim against Bright Data unless it unconditionally releases Bright Data of all liability), (c) gives Client all reasonable assistance, at Client’s expense, and (d) Bright Data shall not negotiate or enter into any settlement for this matter without Client’s prior written consent.

The Agreement will terminate at the end of the calendar month at which the written notice was received, without the party incurring any liability towards the other party by virtue of such termination.
