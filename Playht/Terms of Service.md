PlayHT Terms of Service
=======================

Last Updated: June 1, 2023

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in PlayHT, Inc. (“**PlayHT**,” “**we**,” or “**us**”) and our website at [https://play.ht/terms/](https://play.ht/terms/), along with our related websites, hosted applications, application programming interface(s) (each an “**API**”), mobile or other downloadable applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, the “**Service**”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and PlayHT regarding your use of the Service.

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:

**BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE** (COLLECTIVELY, “**ACCEPTANCE**”), YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PLAYHT’S PRIVACY POLICY AT [HTTPS://PLAY.HT/PRIVACY/](https://play.ht/privacy/) (THE “**PRIVACY POLICY**”), PLAYHT’S COMMUNITY STANDARDS AT (“**COMMUNITY STANDARDS**”) (TOGETHER, THESE “**TERMS**”). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND PLAYHT’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY PLAYHT AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8, WE WILL NOT USE YOUR SUBMITTED CONTENT TO TRAIN OUR AI MODELS.

**Arbitration NOTICE**. Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 16 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration), you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND PLAYHT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

1.

**PlayHT Service Overview.** Our platform allows you to generate audio files with synthetic AI voices.

2.

**Eligibility** You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms. You will require your end users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable law, regulation, and these Terms.

3.

**Accounts and Registration.** To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to create a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you should immediately notify us at [\[email protected\]](https://play.ht/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We reserve the right to remove, reclaim, or change a username you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such username is inappropriate, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.

4.

**General Payment Terms.** Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees as set forth on our [https://play.ht/pricing/](https://play.ht/pricing/) (“**Pricing Page**”). We may charge different prices for certain features within our Service. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as required by law.

4.1

**Price.** PlayHT reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. PlayHT will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information. PlayHT may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if PlayHT gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. PlayHT, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of PlayHT’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.

4.2

**Authorization.** You authorize PlayHT to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by PlayHT, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, then PlayHT may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.

4.3

**Subscription Service.** The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“**Subscription Service**”). The “**Subscription Billing Date**” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select on your account (such period, the “**Initial Subscription Period**”), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a “**Subscription Period**”) unless you cancel the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize PlayHT or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. For information on the “**Subscription Fee**”, please see our Pricing Page. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. PlayHT or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your account or that you otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service by logging into your account or contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://play.ht/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Your cancellation must be received before the renewal date in order to avoid charge for the next subscription period.

4.4

**Delinquent Accounts.** PlayHT may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal Subscription Fee is due, then PlayHT reserves the right to delete your account and any information or User Content associated with your account without any liability to you.

5.

5.1

**All Sales Are Final.** Unless explicitly stated otherwise in a separate written agreement with PlayHT, all sales and transactions made through our platform are considered final, and we do not offer refunds for any reason.

5.2

PlayHT does not offer refunds or prorated refunds for subscription fees once they have been charged.

15.2

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR PLAYHT ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PLAYHT ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.

15.3

THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 15 (Disclaimers; No Warranties by PlayHT) APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. PlayHT does not disclaim any warranty or other right that PlayHT is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.

16.

**Limitation of Liability**

16.1

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE PLAYHT ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY PLAYHT ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 16.5 (Commencing Arbitration) AND 16.7 (ARBITRATION RELIEF) AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE PLAYHT ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (a) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO PLAYHT FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM AND (b) US$100.

16.3

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS.

Further, unless both user and PlayHT agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

17.3

**Arbitration.** Any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and PlayHT arising out of or relating to these Terms, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, and the parties’ rights, remedies, and obligations under these Terms (collectively, “**Disputes**”) will be conclusively determined by a final and binding confidential arbitration proceeding to take place in the City and County of San Francisco, California. Such proceeding will be conducted in English and administered by JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect, before a single arbitrator chosen in accordance with such rules. The ruling by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or any of their assets. You and PlayHT will evenly split the cost of the arbitrator’s fees, but each party will bear their own attorneys’ fees and other costs associated with the arbitration. Both parties agree that this arbitration provision may be enforced by injunction or other equitable order, and no bond or security of any kind will be required with respect to any such injunction or order. In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction. Disputes must be brought to arbitration within the applicable period under law or they are waived.

18.

We may assign these Terms and all rights granted under these Terms, including with respect to your User Content, at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
