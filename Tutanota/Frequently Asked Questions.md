### Frequently Asked Questions

[General questions](https://tutanota.com/support/general)[Security and Privacy](https://tutanota.com/support/security)[How to use Tuta](https://tutanota.com/support/howto)[Payment](https://tutanota.com/support/payment)

I can't access my account

If you can't log in to your account you might be in one of these situations:

* **You have made a typo in your email address or password**:
    * Please double check your address and make sure that you have typed the full address and the correct domain name (for example youraddress@tutanota.com).
    * Make sure that the Caps Lock key is not active.
* **You forgot your password or lost your second authentication factor (2FA)**: Please read [How do I reset my password or second factor?](https://tuta.com/support#reset)
* **The code from your authenticator App (TOTP) is incorrect**: These codes are time-dependent. Please make sure that both Tuta and the authenticator App have the correct time and time zone settings. Some browsers or browser extensions block access to the system's time zone.
* **Your recovery code is not accepted or is wrong**: Please double check whether you are using the recovery key correctly. See [How do I use the recovery code?](https://tuta.com/support#recovery-code)
* **Your account might have been deleted due to inactivity**: In this case, you should see a corresponding message below the login form. Free accounts are deleted if you do not log in for a period longer than six months. We do not recycle Tuta addresses which means that the address is blocked for new registrations. You can still re-use the deleted address with a paid account, **but only if you have the correct credentials for the deleted account**. Please see [How do I reactivate an account deleted due to inactivity?](https://tuta.com/support#inactive-accounts)
* **Your account was suddenly suspended due to another reason**: Some accounts are disabled due to a violation of our [Terms of Service](https://tuta.com/terms) or due to our spam detection. If you think that we have made a mistake, please [contact us in English or German](mailto:hello@tutao.de). Please include the email address of your suspended Tuta account and send us the error message you see below the login form.

**Our secure password reset feature allows only you to reset your password. We have no influence on this process. You can read more about this [here](https://tuta.com/blog/secure-password-reset).**

I have found a bug
