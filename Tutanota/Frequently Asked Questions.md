### Frequently Asked Questions

[General questions](https://tutanota.com/support/general)[Security and Privacy](https://tutanota.com/support/security)[How to use Tuta](https://tutanota.com/support/howto)[Payment](https://tutanota.com/support/payment)

I can't access my account

If you can't log in to your account you might be in one of these situations:

* **You have made a typo in your email address or password**:
    * Please double check your address and make sure that you have typed the full address and the correct domain name (for example youraddress@tutanota.com).
    * Make sure that the Caps Lock key is not active.
* **You forgot your password or lost your second authentication factor (2FA)**: Please read [How do I reset my password or second factor?](https://tuta.com/support#reset)
* **The code from your authenticator App (TOTP) is incorrect**: These codes are time-dependent. Please make sure that both Tuta and the authenticator App have the correct time and time zone settings. Some browsers or browser extensions block access to the system's time zone.
* **Your recovery code is not accepted or is wrong**: Please double check whether you are using the recovery key correctly. See [How do I use the recovery code?](https://tuta.com/support#recovery-code)
* **Your account might have been deleted due to inactivity**: In this case, you should see a corresponding message below the login form. Free accounts are deleted if you do not log in for a period longer than six months. We do not recycle Tuta addresses which means that the address is blocked for new registrations. You can still re-use the deleted address with a paid account, **but only if you have the correct credentials for the deleted account**. Please see [How do I reactivate an account deleted due to inactivity?](https://tuta.com/support#inactive-accounts)
* **Your account was suddenly suspended due to another reason**: Some accounts are disabled due to a violation of our [Terms of Service](https://tuta.com/terms) or due to our spam detection. If you think that we have made a mistake, please [contact us in English or German](mailto:hello@tutao.de). Please include the email address of your suspended Tuta account and send us the error message you see below the login form.

**Our secure password reset feature allows only you to reset your password. We have no influence on this process. You can read more about this [here](https://tuta.com/blog/secure-password-reset).**

How to add alias email addresses

Copy link

[Go to Settings → Email](https://app.tuta.com/settings/mail)→ Scroll down to Email addresses → Click "Show" → Click on the plus symbol.

A pop-up opens where you can create the alias email address you want to add. Click on the arrow button to choose the domain for your alias.

How can I send unencrypted emails by default?

Copy link

Go [here in Settings](https://app.tuta.com/settings/mail). You can choose the 'Default delivery': Encrypted ('Confidential') or not encrypted ('Not confidential'). You can also switch whether an email is encrypted or not when composing the email by clicking on the lock symbol. Emails to other Tuta users are always encrypted by default.

Can Tuta encrypt emails to other email services (external recipients)?

Copy link

Yes. Tuta uses a preshared password for sending an encrypted message to an external recipient, i.e. to someone who does not use Tuta. Please [check here](https://tuta.com/support#encrypted-emails-external) to learn how to send encrypted emails to external recipients.

Or watch our quick YouTube [tutorial](https://youtu.be/paa8l9MnA6w).

Here we explain [how to switch the default](https://tuta.com/support#default-unencrypted) so that emails to external recipients are sent not encrypted and without a password.

Are emails to other Tuta users always encrypted?

Copy link

Yes, when sending emails from Tuta to Tuta, all emails are encrypted automatically end-to-end on your device.﻿ You do not have to enter any passwords.

Check out our quick YouTube [tutorial](https://youtu.be/-si8hguF8_Q) to see how it works.

Is Tuta for free?

Contacts Synchronization

Copy link

synccontacts

Contact synchronization can be activated from Settings > Contacts > Contacts synchronization.

When you activate contact synchronization, your Tuta contacts will be synced with the contacts app you have on your phone. The Tuta app will then:

* create a contacts list for the Tuta contacts on iOS
* create a contacts account for them on Android

Updating your contacts in the Tuta app will update them in the phone's app and vice versa.

Keep in mind:

* If you make any changes to the contact using the phone's default app while Tuta is running in the background, the changes will only be synced upon your next login.
* If you update a Tuta contact on a different device, like the web browser, the Tuta app will use the version of that contact which is on your phone and overwrite any updates.
* Activating contact synchronization will not automatically import your phone's contacts to your Tuta account. If you would like to do that, please see [How can I import contacts?](https://tuta.com/support#contacts-import)

How can I import contacts?

Copy link

importcontacts

There are multiple ways to import contacts to your Tuta account.

* Option 1: Go to Contacts in your Tuta account and click on the button with the three dots next to "All contacts"
* Option 2: If you receive an email with an attached contact (vCard file), you can click on it to import it directly within the app. You will see a preview of all contacts included in this vCard file before importing them.
* Option 3: If you want to import existing contacts from your phone:
    * Go to Settings > Contacts and click on the import button.
    * You will then see a preview of the different contact lists you have on your phone. Select the ones you would like to import.
    * Once done, you will again see a combined preview of all contacts to be imported.
    * If contacts synchronization is activated on your Tuta account, then the imported phone contacts will also be added to the list of contacts (called account on Android) created by the Tuta app on the phone. See [Contacts synchronization](https://tuta.com/support#contacts-sync)

Tuta terms: What is an account? What is a user?

Copy link

When you sign up for Tuta, you create an email **account**. This account initially has one user which is also an administrator. Free, Revolutionary and Legend accounts only have one user. If you want to add users with Revolutionary or Legend, please [contact us](mailto:sales@tutao.de). If you are on a business subscription, you can [add users](https://tuta.com/support#settings-new-user) to your account. You [manage the users (deactivate a user, change password)](https://tuta.com/support#settings-user) within your Tuta account with your administrator user. You may also allow multiple users to be administrators.

 ![Tuta terms chart](/resources/images/faq/user-account-faq-diagram.svg)

In the diagram, the '1' at the arrows means there is one item assigned. A user has one mailbox with one main email address, one (or more) calendar(s), and one address book. The '\*' means multiple items may be assigned, e.g. an account has one or more users, a user may have multiple calendars and a mailbox has one main email address and may have multiple email aliases on top.

**To learn how to set up a user or create an alias, watch this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/ij20iiFVtec).**

Is a calendar included in Tuta?

Copy link

Yes, an encrypted [calendar](https://tuta.com/calendar) is integrated into the Tuta mail client.

My calendar events differ by some hours between different devices. How can I fix this?

Copy link

Please check that the time zones of your devices are in sync, including daylight saving time.

If you are using Firefox/Tor Browser with resistFingerprinting option in about:config, this automatically resets the browser time zone to UTC, which then leads to sync issues.

Can we integrate Tuta into our own product?

Copy link

The Tuta clients use REST services but there is no public documentation for that API or for a library, yet. Keep in mind that when user data is stored in or read from Tuta, it has to be encrypted/decrypted on the client. You may of course dig into the open source code of Tuta and integrate it with your product, but at this time we can not provide any support for this. We will add a public API documentation in the future.

How do I reactivate an Account deleted due to inactivity?

Copy link

lostloginaccessresetinactive

After six months without any login activity, free Tuta accounts including all contained data are permanently deleted and cannot be restored.

If you still have the correct credentials for the deleted account, you can re-use the same address(es) with a new paid account by adding them either as extra addresses or users.

1. Create a paid account (or use any paid Tuta account you already have as the target account). It needs to be a different email address than the deleted one.
    
2. Try to log in to the deleted account.
    
3. If you enter the correct password, you should see a message below the login form with a "Help" link. Click on "Help".
    
     ![Reactivate inactive account](/resources/images/faq/inactive-account-notification-desktop-screen.png)
    
4. Enter the address of your new paid account in the "Target account address" field.
    
     ![Reactivate inactive account](/resources/images/faq/address-takeover-dialog-desktop-screen.png)
    
5. If the lost account had a second authentication factor (2FA) enabled, enter the Recovery Code. Please make sure to check our guide on using the recovery code [here](https://tuta.com/support#recovery-code). Otherwise you can leave this field empty.
    
6. Click OK.
    
7. Log in to your new account and add the old address(es) under Settings > Email > Email addresses.
    

If you encounter any issues with receiving emails to your old address, please make sure to wait up to an hour and try again. Otherwise, please read our guide ["I have reactivated my deleted address but do not receive Emails."](https://tuta.com/support#reactivated-nomail)

I have reactivated my deleted address but still cannot receive emails.

Copy link

Make sure that you have waited one hour before trying to receive emails to the reactivated address.

Make sure that you have added the address either as an extra email address or a user to your new account under [Settings → Email](https://app.tuta.com/settings/mail) → Email addresses or [Settings → User management](https://app.tuta.com/settings/users). If you are not sure, you can watch our short [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ij20iiFVtec) on the difference between email aliases and users.

Unfortunately, some services put email addresses on a blacklist after receiving a bounced delivery report and do not send emails to them at all anymore. If you are trying to receive a password reset link or a login confirmation from an online service, your address might have been banned during the time when your account was inactive. In this case, we cannot do anything from our side. Please contact the service in question and have them check the status of your email address. This usually solves the issue.

How do I use the recovery code?

Copy link

The recovery code is a 64-character long string and consists of the characters a-f and 0-9 only. This means that there could be no confusion between similar looking letters and numbers like the letter "o" and the number zero "0" for example.

This string is separated into 16 ordered groups each consisting of 4 characters.

When entering the recovery code you have to include the spaces between every four characters and all letters must be entered in lower-case.

How can I share a contact list?

Copy link

You can share a contact list with any Tuta user. Go to [contacts](https://app.tuta.com/contact) and click the three dots next to your contact list's name. When sharing you can also specify one of three different access permissions to the list:

* Read
* Read and write
* Write and manage sharing

The recipient will receive a notification email and will be able to see and accept the invitation under the contact lists section in the [contacts view](https://app.tuta.com/contact).

Recipients of shared contact lists can change the display name of the list on their account.

What are contact lists?

Copy link

Contact lists are lists of addresses that can be used in Tuta to easily and quickly include multiple recipients when sending emails, event invitations or even when sharing contacts.

The list can include existing contacts or other addresses and can be shared with other Tuta users.

Here you can read [how to create and use contact lists](https://tuta.com/support#howto-contact-lists) or [how to share contact lists](https://tuta.com/support#contact-lists-sharing).

How can I create and use contact lists?

Copy link

Contact lists are available on all new paid plans. To create a contact list navigate to [contacts](https://app.tuta.com/contact) and click on the plus button. On mobile devices, open the left side menu in order to see the contact lists section and the plus button.

An editor pop-up window will open where you can enter the name of the new contact list and optionally add entries below.

When you start typing an address you, will see suggestions from your existing contacts but you can also add addresses that are not yet in your address book.

You can add multiple addresses and click "Save" when done. If you later decide to rename or delete the list, simply click on the three dots button next to its name.

Once you have a list created, you can use it in any recipient field in Tuta. For example when sending an email or an event invitation. Just enter the name of the contact list in the address field.

Here you can read [how to share contact lists](https://tuta.com/support#contact-lists-sharing).

What do I do if I have lost my recovery code?

Copy link

lostaccessresetrecovery

Your recovery code can be viewed in your Tuta account, provided that you are logged in and know your password. Simply go to Settings > Login and click on the pencil icon next to Recovery code.

If you know your password but still cannot log in because of a lost second authentication factor, we can only help if you have one of our paid plans and have either your PayPal or credit card stored on your account. In this case please [contact us in English or German](mailto:hello@tutao.de). Unfortunately we cannot provide any help in the case of free Tuta accounts because we have no way of verifying your ownership of the account.

If you have lost your password, then there is unfortunately nothing we can do to reset it for you. If we are able to verify you with the payment data, we can allow you to merge the lost address with a new paid account. All data stored in the previous account will be lost.

How can I upgrade a Free account and book additional features?

Copy link

You can [switch the subscription](https://tuta.com/support#settings-upgrade) in Tuta by upgrading or downgrading.

How can I upgrade my Tuta account with cryptocurrency?

To redeem a gift card from Proxystore, please follow the instructions in Proxystore right after ordering the gift card. You will get a gift card link. When you use the link, you need to choose 'Use existing account' or create a new account, depending on where you want to apply the credit to. Once you have added the gift card, you can check the credit on your account under Settings -> Payment. When upgrading your account, you can now choose 'Account balance' so that no payment details need to be linked to your Tuta account.

Can I book a Tuta subscription for multiple years?

Copy link

Yes, you can buy [gift cards](https://tuta.com/support#gift-cards) and add them to your own account. Once the credit is added to your account, it does not expire. It will be used for future invoices. This gives you the option to top up your account whenever it is convenient for you. You can check your credit under 'Settings' -> 'Payment'.

Unlock the Tuta app with a pin, or biometrics (fingerprint, Face ID)

Copy link

You can secure the stored app login with a pin, pattern or biometrics (fingerprint, Face ID, etc.). Please go to Settings -> Login -> Unlock method to activate this.

This option will only show after you have stored your login credentials in the Tuta app. Upon login tick the checkbox 'Store password' to store your login credentials.

How do I choose a strong password?

Copy link

Tuta uses a password strength indicator that takes several aspects of a password into consideration to make sure your chosen password is a perfect match for your [secure email](https://tuta.com/) account. You can find additional tips on how to choose a strong password [here](https://tuta.com/blog/how-create-strong-password).

Tuta has no limitations in regard to the password length or used characters; all unicode characters are respected.

When I log out of Tuta, the browser or app always logs in again. What can I do to stop this?

Copy link

If you click on 'Logout', you log out. Please note: If you have previously saved the password, you are now logged out, but the password is still saved for automatic login. To 'unsave' the password, please log out. The login screen appears, click on 'More' and 'Delete credentials'.

How does the passphrase generator work?

Copy link

A secure password is one that is random enough that it cannot be guessed in a feasible amount of time. But random strings of alphanumeric characters are hard to remember. That's why we have implemented a passphrase generator that finds a good balance between security and memorability. The generator chooses six easy words from a huge curated list and outputs a passphrase that is secure as well as easy to type and remember. Here are more tips on [how to create and remember a strong password](https://tuta.com/blog/how-create-strong-password).

What hashing function is used for the password?

Copy link

Your password is salted and hashed with Argon2 on your device before being transmitted to Tuta. Argon2 is the most reliable method because brute-force attacks need much more time in comparison to conventional methods such as MD5 or SHA.﻿ With this method, we guarantee an integrated confidentiality and we allow you to access and decrypt your emails from desktops and mobile devices instantly.

Tuta secures my private key with my password. Can you access my password?

Copy link

No. When a password is used for authentication (login), it is not necessary that it is known to the server you want to authenticate with. The server only needs a fingerprint (hash) of your password. With Tuta, your hash for authentication is calculated by your browser and only the hash is being sent. Your password never travels the Internet in plain text and it is never seen by our server. As hashes are non-invertible, the server is unable to reconstruct your password from the hash. The server is not able to decrypt your message, but it is still able to log you in.

My password was stolen. What should I do now?

Copy link

If you think your password was disclosed to someone else but you can still log into your account, please do the following:

* Change your password in 'Settings' -> 'Login' -> 'Password'.
* Update your recovery code in 'Settings' -> 'Login' -> 'Recovery code'.

If the attacker had been logged in as well, changing the password automatically logs them out.

We encourage you to always use [2FA](https://tuta.com/blog/login-security-best-practice) with your accounts as it makes it close to impossible for an attacker to log into your account.

If you can not log into your account anymore, please check this [FAQ](https://tuta.com/support#access-lost).

Go to Settings - Login and click on the pen symbol next to 'Recovery Code' to show the code or update it. To do this, you need to enter your password.

What encryption algorithms does Tuta use?

Copy link

For email encryption between users, Tuta uses a standardized, hybrid method consisting of a symmetrical and an asymmetrical algorithm. Tuta uses [AES with a length of 256 bit](https://tuta.com/blog/aes-256-encryption) and RSA with 2048 bit or a combination of ECDH (x25519) and Kyber-1024 (for [quantum-safe accounts](https://tuta.com/blog/post-quantum-cryptography)). Emails to external recipients are encrypted symmetrically with AES 256 bit.﻿

Does Tuta log IP addresses or can I use my encrypted mailbox anonymously?

Copy link

By default, we do not log IP addresses when you log in or when you send an email. The IP addresses of sent and received emails are stripped so that your location remains unknown.

We only log IP addresses of individual accounts in case of serious criminal acts such as murder, child pornography, robbery, bomb threats and blackmail after being served a valid court order by a German judge. You can find details on this as well as on German data protection rights [on our blog](https://tuta.com/blog/data-privacy-germany).

Learn on our blog how Tuta fights illegal mass surveillance by providing an [anonymous email](https://tuta.com/blog/anonymous-email) service. Upon registration you do not need to provide any personal data (e.g. no phone number required). We will also make it possible to pay for Tuta with [Bitcoin](https://tuta.com/blog/bitcoin-btc).

How are my emails encrypted with Tuta?

Copy link

Tuta automatically encrypts all emails stored in your mailbox. Emails between Tuta users are automatically encrypted end-to-end, and emails to external users can be secured with the help of a password. [Here we explain the differences between a confidential (end-to-end encrypted) and a non-confidential email](https://tuta.com/support#email-encrypt).

Independent of the end-to-end encryption, the [transport between the client and Tuta servers is secured with TLS to maximize security](https://tuta.com/blog/tutanota-uses-dane-on-top-of-ssl-pfs).

Watch our YouTube [email encryption guide](https://youtu.be/r2pJ5h7a_o8) for Tuta - the quickest email encryption guide you can get!

Is my address book within Tuta encrypted?

Copy link

Yes, all data within Tuta is end-to-end encrypted and only accessible with your password. Scanning and profiling of your data is not possible.﻿Where does the encryption process take place?

Copy link

Encryption and decryption of data always happens locally on your device upon login. All data is end-to-end encrypted and only you can access the data with your password.﻿

How can I view headers in my encrypted mailbox?

Copy link

You can show headers of received emails by pressing the shortcut H. Tuta strips headers from emails sent to protect your privacy.

To show all shortcuts in Tuta, please press F1 (Fn & F1).

Do you delete inactive accounts / recycle email addresses?

Copy link

A deleted email address (also if it is an alias) will not be recycled for security reasons. There must be no possibility that someone else is able to register your previously used email address, and then, by accident, receive a confidential email that was meant for you.

Free of charge accounts are deleted after an inactive period of six months. A regular login is necessary to prevent automatic deletion. We delete such accounts for security reasons and also to allow us to offer free of charge Tuta accounts at all. However, the email addresses of such deleted accounts may be taken over into another paid account and re-used as email aliases or additional user addresses if you still have the valid login credentials.

To re-use the email address of the inactive account

1. You need to create a paid email account (or use any paid Tuta account you already have as the target account).
2. Login to your lost account.

 ![Reactivate inactive account](/resources/images/faq/inactive-account-notification-desktop-screen.png)

3. Click on 'Help' as you can see in the screenshot above.

 ![Reactivate inactive account](/resources/images/faq/address-takeover-dialog-desktop-screen.png)

4. Enter the 'Target account address' (and - if you enabled two-factor authentication - the recovery code of the lost address).

Then you can add the lost address(es) as an alias (or user) to the target email account. We call it [merging of addresses](https://tuta.com/support#merge).

Where are my keys generated and how is my private key secured?

Copy link

Your private and your public keys are generated locally within your browser upon registration. Your private key is encrypted with your password. This way your login password receives the status of the private key. The key is encrypted so strongly that only you can use the key for encrypting and decrypting data. This is why a strong password is essential. An automatic password check on the client makes sure that you use a strong password. Your password is never transmitted to the server in plain text. It is salted and then hashed with Argon2 locally on your device so that neither the server nor we have access to your password. With this innovative design you can access your encrypted inbox from any device (desktop, mobile) easily.﻿

Why is automatic image loading blocked in Tuta Mail?

Copy link

Tuta does not load pictures automatically when you open an email. When you load external images manually, please note that

* someone knows that you read the email.
* someone may add cookies to your browser (if your browser is not configured to reject them).
* someone may track your location with your IP address.
* someone may track the parameters of your device.

Here we explain how to [display external images](https://tuta.com/support#view-image). Please read here how we make sure that you can use Tuta as an [anonymous email service](https://tuta.com/blog/anonymous-email).

One of my emails has a warning saying mail authentication is missing or failed. What does it mean?

Copy link

We require all messages to be authenticated. Without authentication, the email could be coming from anyone or could be modified so you should always treat such emails with scrutiny. If you see a message where the authentication has failed (red warning banner), you should be especially careful as it means that this email was likely faked.

One of my emails is displaying a phishing warning. What does it mean?

Copy link

Phishing is a name or type of online scam in which criminals try to look like a legitimate sender in order to get your data such as credentials or credit card data. Phishers use very sophisticated psychological techniques and develop very realistic copies of real websites and emails.

If you see a phishing banner, it means that some parts of this email match our phishing signatures after other users reported similar emails as phishing. Please be extremely careful with such messages. Usually, phishing emails contain a special link to the website which looks real but it actually is not. If you think that the email is legitimate and you opened the link, please make sure to check the full website URL: Check that you see all of it, sometimes only one part or one character may be swapped. Here is more information on [how to prevent email phishing attacks](https://tuta.com/blog/how-to-prevent-phishing).

You can mark an email as not phishing so you will not see the warning message anymore for this email.

We never send you emails with links where you need to type in your password. We encourage you to always protect your [login credentials](https://tuta.com/blog/login-security-best-practice) with 2FA as this makes it close to impossible for an attacker to log into your account.

If you've already fallen for a phishing attack, please check this [FAQ](https://tuta.com/support#password-stolen).

Where are the Tuta servers located?

Copy link

The Tuta servers are located in secure and ISO27001 certified data centers in Germany. All saved data are subject to the strict German privacy protection laws. Independent of that all data is end-to-end encrypted and cannot be read by the Tutao GmbH as the provider or by any third party.﻿

Can I disable sessions remotely (session handling)?

Copy link

Yes. You can view and remotely close active sessions under [Settings -> Login](https://app.tuta.com/settings/login).

[Check our How-to to learn how to enable storing of closed sessions](https://tuta.com/support#settings-login) to monitor whether someone else has access to your account. To guarantee the users' privacy, we have implemented the feature as follows:

* The IP address is stored encrypted, and only the user can decrypt this information. No one else - not even we at Tuta - can access this information.
* IP addresses are only stored for one week and then automatically deleted.

What is encrypted and what can you read?

Copy link

Tuta encrypts all data stored in your mailbox (contacts, emails, email signature, inbox rules, invoice data, payment method, certificate, and private keys of your own domains). When sending an email, Tuta encrypts the subject, content, and attachments automatically.

**You can find a detailed explanation about what is encrypted in Tuta on our [security](https://tuta.com/security) page.**

We can read only the following metadata:

* sender email address
* recipient email address
* date of the email

We are looking into possibilities to hide the metadata in the future as well.﻿

Where can I report a security issue or a vulnerability that I found in Tuta?

Copy link

As an external recipient, can I re-access my emails later?

Copy link

Yes, you can always access the emails sent via Tuta through the link from your latest notification email. Old notification links from the same sender are de-activated for security reasons. Your exchanged password, however, stays unchanged as long as the sender does not change it. If you have saved the password upon accessing your confidential emails in your browser, you do not have to re-enter it.﻿

Can I add alias email addresses in Tuta Mail?

Copy link

Email aliases are additional email addresses that you can use with the same mailbox without having to switch accounts. Additional email addresses are included in all paid plans of Tuta. If you upgrade to any of our paid plans, you can add alias email addresses.

Are there email limits to protect Tuta from being abused by spammers?

Copy link

Yes, Tuta uses different variables to calculate email limits for individual accounts. This is necessary to protect our free and anonymous email service from spammers who try to abuse Tuta. If spammers were able to abuse Tuta, it would harm all Tuta users - ie Tuta domains could end up on email spam lists, which we have to prevent under all circumstances.

If you receive the following message in your Tuta account "It looks like you exceeded the number of allowed emails. Please try again later.", the anti-spam protection method has stopped your account temporarily from sending new emails. Please wait a day or two to send new emails again.

If you need to send more emails immediately, please upgrade to any of our paid plans as limits for paying users are much higher. Simply click on 'Plan' in your side menu bar of Tuta.

Please note that Tuta is not meant for sending out mass mailings such as newsletters. Please read our [Terms & Conditions](https://tuta.com/terms) for details.

Can I receive notifications to another email account about incoming emails?

Copy link

Yes, with a paid subscription you can set up email notifications to any email address under 'Settings' - 'Notifications'. You will be informed about new emails once until you log in. Only if you have logged in to view this email, Tuta will send another notification to keep notification emails to a minimum.

As a Free user, you can receive push notifications in the browser, the Android & iOS app as well as the desktop clients.

Where can I request a new feature for Tuta?

Copy link

You can request and discuss new features with us and other users [in our Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/tutanota/). You can check whether someone has already requested this feature and whether we have already added it to our [Roadmap](https://tuta.com/roadmap).

Can I use a third-party email app like Thunderbird?

Copy link

No, this is not possible for security reasons. Tuta does not support the use of third-party email clients or the protocols IMAP/POP3/SMTP as we cannot guarantee end-to-end encryption of your data. Instead, Tuta offers email [desktop clients for Linux, macOS and Windows](https://tuta.com/blog/desktop-clients-tutanota) as well as a web client and apps for Android and iOS. We aim to provide all required functionalities with our own apps, for instance, offline access to your encrypted data is possible with our apps.

How to import your data to Tuta

Copy link

**Emails**: [You can export/download individual emails or batch-export emails by using multi-select](https://tuta.com/support#generalMail). Email import is not yet possible. We plan to support email import as well as an even easier export function with our new [secure desktop clients](https://tuta.com/blog/desktop-clients-tutanota).

Is it possible to merge several Tuta email addresses in one account?

Copy link

Yes, you can add existing email addresses (e.g. Alice2, Alice3) as aliases or users to a paid account (Alice1):

1. Delete the email accounts (e.g. Alice2, Alice3)
2. Upon deletion, it is important to enter the 'Target account address' (Alice1).
3. Then login to the stated target email account (Alice 1). Go to Settings → Email → Email aliases. Click on 'SHOW EMAIL ALIASES', click on the plus symbol, and add the deleted email address(es) here. Alternatively, you can add the address(es) as user(s) under Settings → User management by clicking on 'Add user'.

Please note: You are only transferring the email addresses. Emails and contacts stored in the deleted accounts (Alice2, Alice3) are being deleted. Please export important emails before deleting the accounts.

How can I use Tuta with multiple users at the same time?

Copy link

In the mobile app, you can currently only login with one user. To switch to another user, you must log out and log in again. You can login with multiple users in the browser by opening several tabs or windows. In the desktop clients, you can also open several windows to login with multiple users.

Push notifications on my Android phone are being delayed. What can I do?

Copy link

Please check the app settings on your phone. As we do not use Google's push notifications service, battery optimization must be disabled for Tuta to receive push notifications instantly.

This is necessary to offer you an [open source email service free from any links to Google](https://tuta.com/open-source).

Can I store my data locally so that I have access when offline?

Copy link

Yes, the Tuta mobile apps for iOS and Android as well as the Tuta desktop clients can store a local copy of your mailbox.

To activate local storage of data, please store your password within the client. By default, all contacts, calendars, and all emails sent and received within the last 30 days are then stored locally.

With all of Tuta's paid subscriptions you can increase the timeframe for which emails should be stored under Settings -> Email -> Local data. Please note that the emails must be loaded once to create the local copy.

Why does Tuta Mail not use PGP?

Copy link

Current encryption standards like PGP and S/MIME have several issues that we plan to address with Tuta. These standards do not support forward secrecy and are not resistant to attacks from quantum computers.

In addition, it is important to us that the subject line in emails is also encrypted. That's why we have developed a solution that is also based on recognized algorithms (RSA 2048 and AES 256) and that automatically encrypts the subject, the content and the attachments. We have replaced RSA with ECDH (x25519) Kyber-1024 to achieve [quantum-resistant encryption](https://tuta.com/blog/post-quantum-cryptography).

In the future, we plan to support forward secrecy. [You can find more information on why Tuta does not use PGP here](https://tuta.com/encryption).

We also see the importance that Tuta needs to be interoperable with other encryption solutions. We will develop an API so that Tuta users can communicate with users of other secure services confidentially in the future.

Can I use plus addresses for my Tuta email address?

Copy link

No, Tuta does not support plus addressing (xyz+username@tutanota.com) for Tuta domains. If you want to register with different plus addresses at different sites, you can upgrade to a plan that supports [alias email addresses](https://tuta.com/support#aliases) (limited to the number of aliases you book). Alternatively, you can use a [custom email domain with catch-all](https://tuta.com/support#custom-domain) to create an unlimited number of plus addresses for incoming emails.

Does Tuta offer full-text search?

Copy link

Yes, Tuta comes with full-text search of your encrypted mailbox. In the free version, the search is limited to four weeks into the past due to heavy server load caused by the encrypted search feature. [Learn here how you can improve your search results](https://tuta.com/support#searching). The spam folder is excluded from the search.

Search is executed locally via an encrypted search index to guarantee the security and privacy of your data as well as your search queries. As the search index needs to be stored in your browser, it does not work in private mode/incognito mode. [Read here how our innovative full-text search on encrypted data works](https://tuta.com/blog/first-search-encrypted-data).

Why do I see "Could not access secret storage" in the desktop client?

Copy link

Tuta desktop app uses a system keychain to be able to encrypt sensitive details such as credentials and alarms. On Linux there must be an app installed that provides secret storage (org.freedesktop.secrets interface). This is usually set up together with the rest of the desktop environment but sometimes it requires manual setup. Installing GNOME Seahorse and configuring keychain there should be sufficient. KeePassXC is another provider which can be used but it must be additionally configured.

Where do I find the Settings?

Copy link

The Settings are in the [navigation menu](https://tuta.com/support#nav) to the left.

Can I change the signature in a free account?

Copy link

Yes, you can change the signature in [Settings -> Email](https://app.tuta.com/settings/mail). Every account can change their signature. To support our free and [secure email](https://tuta.com/) service, please leave the link to our homepage in your signature.

Can I change the notification sound for the Android app?

Copy link

Yes, users have full control over notifications through the app system settings. On your phone go to 'Apps', select 'Tuta', and change the notification setting for new emails.

Does Tuta use a spam filter?

Copy link

Yes, Tuta uses a spam filter to keep your mailbox free from spam. We are improving this filter continuously. Should you receive spam emails in your inbox, you can also configure [your own spam rules here](https://tuta.com/support#spam) to deny or allow certain email addresses or domains. If a sender is blocked (rejected) by the spam filter, you can [change the settings to allow the sender](https://tuta.com/support#whitelist) for your account.

In paid accounts, only admins can create spam rules that are being applied across all users.

Is it possible to edit Tuta emails (HTML editing)?

Copy link

Yes, Tuta supports HTML editing options (embed images, add lists, bold, italics, underline, monospace, add hyperlinks, align the text left, center, right, justified, change text size, remove all formatting). These are explained in our how-to along with lots of information on [email handling](https://tuta.com/support#mail-handling).

Are emails in Trash and Spam folder deleted?

Copy link

Yes, all emails in Trash or Spam are automatically deleted 30 days after the emails were moved to these folders. You can also manually empty these folders with one click. **Please note**: Emails deleted from Trash or Spam folders are physically deleted and can't be restored.

Why does the Tuta app ask me to update WebView?

Copy link

WebView is a system app on Android devices which allows us to display web content inside the Tuta app. Newer versions let us use newer technologies to make the app smaller, faster, more beautiful, and more reliable. If you experiencing issues or bugs with the Android app, updating WebView has a good chance to help.

[Here are instructions on how to update WebView on your phone](https://tuta.com/support#web).

How can I zoom in on the Tuta app?

Copy link

In the apps, you can zoom with a double tap. We plan to improve this behavior further.

On desktop, you can zoom with Ctrl/Cmd + scroll.

My newly created account has been put on hold for 48 hours after registration. What should I do?

Copy link

Some accounts are automatically marked for approval upon sign-up to prevent abuse. This often affects IPs from VPN services or Tor as spammers try to bypass our anti-spam protection method by abusing these services. Please read here why the 48-hour wait is necessary to protect your privacy to the maximum with a truly [anonymous email](https://tuta.com/blog/anonymous-email) service.

During these 48 hours, emails cannot be sent or received. **Please do not share your new email address before the blocking has been lifted automatically.**

How do I solve the Tuta Captcha upon registration?

Copy link

Tuta uses its own Captcha so that we do not have to depend on using Google Captcha. This enables us to offer an [open source email service without any links to Google](https://tuta.com/open-source).

The Tuta Captcha shows a clock. You need to enter the displayed time with four numerals, including the colon in the middle. If the displayed time is 8.30 for example, you have to enter 08:30 or 20:30 exactly.

How do I delete my Tuta account?

Copy link

To delete your account, go to Settings - Global Settings - Delete Account. You need to enter your password upon deletion.

Please note: Deleted Tuta accounts can't be restored. Deleted email addresses are blocked for registration and can't be used again.

I don't receive confirmation emails from services or newsletters. What can I do?

Copy link

Please check whether the sender was blocked by following this [instruction](https://tuta.com/support#whitelist).

Sometimes newly created email addresses are put on hold for 48 hours to prevent abuse. It is important that you do not share your email address until this block is lifted automatically. If you do use the email address to register elsewhere or sign up for newsletters before the block is lifted, this service will send you a confirmation email, which will bounce with a temporary error. This might lead to problems registering with this service, even in the future.

The same issue sometimes affects users whose Tuta email address has been blocked, for instance due to inactivity. Even after you reactivate your Tuta email address, this might lead to problems receiving emails from online services because they stopped sending to your address due to bounces. In that case, please contact the service in question and ask them to start sending to your address again.

I can't register with my Tuta email address at an online service. What can I do?

Copy link

Most websites and online services let you register with your chosen Tuta email address just fine. Unfortunately, we have received reports from users that some websites block Tuta email addresses for registrations. Please check [these options](https://tuta.com/blog/website-blocks-secure-email-tutanota) to resolve this situation.

I have received an abusive email (spam, phishing) from one of your domains. How do I report abuse?

Setting up a second factor (2FA) in Tuta

Copy link

We recommend setting up 2FA because of its security benefits. [Learn in our online security guide how 2FA helps you to keep your emails safe from hackers](https://tuta.com/blog/email-security-guide-online).

**Registering your second factor**

You can connect your second factor with Tuta in [Settings -> Login](https://app.tuta.com/settings/login). As admin you can setup second factors for your users in [Settings -> User management](https://app.tuta.com/settings/users).

Tuta currently supports the following second factor types:

* Security keys (U2F), e.g. Yubikey. U2F is supported in all Tuta clients.
* TOTP with an authenticator app such as FreeOTP+, andOTP, Authenticator, Authy etc. If setting up a second factor with TOTP fails, please make sure that the time is synced between your devices.

Second factors can be added by administrators and users, but only admins can remove assigned second factors.

**Note: If you lose your second factor, you will no longer be able to login to your account. To prevent this, you can add multiple second factors. Additionally, please note down the recovery code shown to you when adding a second factor.**

**Authenticating with your second factor**

During login you have to authenticate with one of your second factors. Alternatively, you may also accept that session from another logged in client. If your browser does not support the second factor you had registered, you can only accept the session from another client.

**How to reset your second factor if you lose it**

For resetting your second factor, you will need your personal recovery code and your password. You can view and also update your recovery code in [Settings -> Login](https://app.tuta.com/settings/login).

If you have lost your second factor, click on [More -> Lost account access](https://app.tuta.com/recover) on the login page. There you will have to enter your recovery code as well as your password to delete all your second factors.

When do I need encrypted emails?

Copy link

Email encryption is needed whenever you want to send a confidential email. That is whenever your email contains personal information that should not become public. The following examples show the differences between end-to-end encrypted, confidential emails and emails that are not being end-to-end encrypted in Tuta.

In this YouTube tutorial we demonstrate how you can [send an encrypted email in seconds](https://youtu.be/-si8hguF8_Q).

Alice is registered with Tuta, Bob may be registered with Tuta or an external recipient and Carol is not registered with Tuta. In any case, all emails (including attachments) are stored encrypted on the Tuta servers. Independent of the end-to-end encryption, the [transport between the client and Tuta servers is secured with TLS to maximize security](https://tuta.com/blog/tutanota-uses-dane-on-top-of-ssl-pfs).

**Sending and receiving end-to-end encrypted emails**  
The email is encrypted on Alice's client, stored encrypted on the server and can only be decrypted by Alice or Bob.

 ![Sending and receiving end-to-end encrypted emails](/resources/images/faq/encrypted-sending-diagram.png)

**Sending non-confidential emails**  
The email is sent via SMTP to the recipient. Still, the sent email is encrypted for Alice on the server and then stored.

 ![Sending non-confidential emails](/resources/images/faq/unencrypted-sending-diagram.png)

**Receiving non-confidential emails**  
When the SMTP email is received by the Tuta server, it is encrypted for Alice and then stored on the server.﻿

How to add custom domain(s) to Tuta Mail

Copy link

If you own one or more domain names that you want to use with Tuta, you can add these domains to your paid subscription of Tuta. The setup wizard for your custom email domain will guide you through the process in just four small steps. In each step, the wizard will explain, which configuration changes you have to make. If you don't have a Tuta account, you can register [here](https://app.tuta.com/signup).

The setup wizard for your custom email domain can be found in 'Settings' -> 'Global settings' -> 'Custom email domains' by clicking the '+' button.

**Check out [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/NKYyqRtRc0o) to learn how to set up your own domain in Tuta.**

In order to send and receive emails with your custom domain in Tuta, you need to configure the following types of DNS records in the settings of your domain name provider. Prior to configuring those DNS records, the wizard will allow you to create new users or email aliases for your custom domain in order to have a smart switch to receiving emails in Tuta.

* a TXT record to prove that you are the owner of the domain
* an MX record with any priority
* a TXT record for SPF
* CNAME records (\_domainkey) for DKIM
* CNAME records for MTA-STS
* a TXT record (\_dmarc) for DMARC is recommended

The exact values that these DNS records should point to will be shown to you in the setup wizard.

The MX record is necessary to relay emails for your domain to the Tuta servers. The SPF TXT record marks the Tuta server as a valid sender of emails from your domain. The \_domainkey and \_dmarc records make sure your emails are signed with DKIM and sender spoofing of your domain's email addresses can be detected automatically by the recipient mail servers. The MTA-STS records make sure that transport encryption and authentication are used between different mail servers.

Tuta will indicate if the DNS records are fine for all your domains or if there is something that has to be changed.

Please note that with some domain name providers, it may take up to a few hours before changes to your DNS records become visible for other mail servers. [You can check your DNS settings here](http://mxtoolbox.com/).

How can I use Tuta in my organization or company with my custom email domain?

Copy link

1. [Register a paid Tuta account here](https://app.tuta.com/signup). This will create your initial administrator user mailbox. Once you have added additional users to your account, you can mark all - or just some - as admins. Your administrator(s) can configure all general settings and manage users, e.g. reset their passwords. As we at Tuta can not reset passwords, we recommend having at least two admins and/or to note down the recovery code during the signup process. You have to choose one of the Tuta domains for your initial admin user email address. You can later add an alias of your custom email domain to this user.
2. Add your custom email domain in "Settings" -> "Global settings" -> "Custom email domains". You have to set a DNS record for your custom email domain in order for us to verify that the domain is yours. You will find the exact instructions in Tuta when setting up your domain but you can also read about it [here](https://tuta.com/support#how-to-add-domain).
3. Add users (i.e. mailboxes) for your domain in "Settings" -> "User Management". If you have a large number of users, you can import a CSV file containing the user name, email address, and password. This is useful to automatically create all users in one single step.
4. Set the DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC) for your custom email domain in order to be able to send and receive emails with your custom domain in Tuta. If it does not work, you will see a list of missing or bad DNS records in "Settings" -> "Global settings" -> "Custom email domains".
5. Provide the user passwords to the users, so they can log in to their mailboxes.

Please note that we do not support email import, yet. We plan to enable import in the coming months. For now, we recommend keeping your old mailboxes as a reference when moving to Tuta from another provider or storing all emails locally.

On our business site, there is a summary of all available features of [Tuta's secure business emails](https://tuta.com/business).

How do I reset my password or second factor?

Copy link

When you create a new Tuta account, our [secure password reset feature](https://tuta.com/blog/secure-password-reset) empowers only you to reset your account yourself. Please make sure that:

* **You write your password down and keep it somewhere safe.**
* **You write down your recovery code to never lose access to your Tuta account.**

In case you can't login to Tuta, please make sure that:

* You have entered your email address with the correct ending, e.g. ".de" or ".com".
* The caps lock key is disabled.
* The time on your TOTP device is synchronized correctly (only applies if second factor authentication with TOTP fails).

We do not know your password and can't modify your second factors. However, there are different ways on how to regain access to your mailbox in case of a lost password or a second factor.

**Administrator is available**

If you are a member of an organization or a business: Ask your administrator to reset your password. Each administrator can reset the passwords of other users and admins. If you want to make sure to never lose your paid account, it's best to have at least two administrators.

**Recovery code is available**

Your recovery code is your personal code for resetting your account. If you did write it down when you created your account, you can reset your password or second factor using your personal recovery code [by clicking on _More_ > _Lost account access_ on the login page](https://app.tuta.com/recover).

You can view and also update your recovery code in [_Settings_ > _Login_](https://app.tuta.com/settings/login). [You can also find more information on this secure reset feature on our blog](https://tuta.com/blog/secure-password-reset).

**With 2FA enabled, you will need 2 out of 3 to reset your Tuta account**:

[Click here to reset your password](https://app.tuta.com/recover). You will need your second factor (if 2FA is enabled) and your recovery code.

[Click here to reset your second factor](https://app.tuta.com/recover). You will need your login password and the recovery code.

**Please note**: If you lose your password and your second factor, there is no option to reset your Tuta account with the recovery code.

How to improve my search results?

Copy link

To search your encrypted mailbox, simply click on the top search field or press F.

It is very important to know that you can search for multiple words at once, for instance, the sender's email address, keyword, and file ending. Such a search could look like this: alice@tutanota.de meeting notes pdf

 ![Tuta search field](/resources/images/faq/search-pop-desktop-screen.png)

When you press enter, Tuta takes you to a more detailed search mask. The free search feature goes back one month into the past.

 ![Detailed search mask](/resources/images/faq/search-results-desktop-screen.png)

The detailed search mask lets you specify the time frame which should be searched (one month for free users). The unlimited search feature also lets you filter your search, e.g. who sent the email, to whom did you send the email, was the search query contained in the subject or in the body, and what folder should be searched.

As all data in Tuta is encrypted, using our innovative search feature causes a lot of traffic. This is why unlimited search is only available to paying users. [Learn here how you can benefit from extra features by upgrading](https://tuta.com/pricing#plans).

**Please note**: You can only search emails and contacts, thus, the search field is not shown when you are browsing the 'Settings' of your mailbox.

Instruction on updating WebView on Android

Copy link

To update WebView it is enough to install or update one of the following apps:

* For most Android versions: [Android System WebView](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview)
    
* For Android N (7), Android O (8), Android P (9): [Chrome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome)
    

For some specific Android installations (e.g. custom Android ROMs, some LeEco devices) the procedure might be different or might not work. Please refer to your device or OS vendor for instructions.

**Advanced: Changing WebView provider**

If you do not want to use Google-provided WebView, it is possible to install some other app (like Chromium or another WebView build) which can be used instead. Please refer to [these instructions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/android_webview/docs/prerelease.md). Please note that we can only support Chrome/Chromium based WebView.

Encrypted email to an external recipient

Copy link

When sending an encrypted email to an external recipient, you need to specify a password when composing the email.

 ![Writing an email](/resources/images/faq/write-external-email-desktop-screen.png)

Once set, the password will be automatically saved along with the contact in your Tuta address book, which makes your encrypted address book the password manager for your external contacts. Next time you write an email to that recipient, you simply specify the email address and Tuta automatically enters the password. The password needs to be exchanged via a second channel. If you would like to change the password, you can either do this within the contacts view or when composing a new email to this external recipient.

The external recipient

* receives a notification email with a link to Tuta (browser opens up),
* enters the exchanged password,
* can read the automatically decrypted email, reply confidentially, export all exchanged messages, and save them locally.

Note: The link within the notification email contains a salt which is needed for decryption along with the password. Thus, someone who wants to intercept your encrypted messages needs the exact link and the password. (An old link gets deactivated as soon as you send a new email to the same email address.)

Watch our YouTube tutorial on how to send an [encrypted email to external recipients](https://youtu.be/paa8l9MnA6w).

 ![Report phishing](/resources/images/faq/phishing-email-desktop-screen.png) 

Spam detection rules

Copy link

Spam detection in Tuta is multi staged. For incoming unencrypted SMTP emails, the received email is checked against DNS spam lists first. In the second stage, we filter emails by executing content checks and mark emails as spam or not. Emails that have been marked as spam will be moved to the spam folder of your mailbox. In the third stage, we filter spam on the base of user defined email sender lists. This list provides the possibility to classify email addresses as spam or not as spam. The check is active for all incoming emails and can be configured by the administrator. The rules are valid for all users.

[As an administrator for a Tuta account you can configure the email address list here in Settings](https://app.tuta.com/settings/global).

Within a received email, please click on 'Show more', then click on the From address to assign the email address, the domain, or the top level domain with one of the following spam rules:

* Not spam - Emails from this sender email address are always stored in the inbox.
* Always spam - Emails from this sender email address will always be stored in the spam folder.
* Discard - Emails from this sender email address will be silently discarded. The sender does not get any information about it.

The "No spam" rule has a higher priority than "Always spam" and "Discard" has the lowest priority.

You can set spam rules for sender addresses (highest priority), domains (lower priority), and top level domains (lowest priority). To add a spam rule for a domain, just enter the domain like xyz.com without putting an @ in front. This rule will also apply to emails sent from a subdomain. To add a spam rule for a top level domain, just put in com - for example - no dot is needed before this.

Rules for domains are restricted. You are not able to assign the rules "Always spam" and "Discard" to Tuta domains, neither to your custom domains.

You also have the option to allow all emails. To do this, create a spam rule and put in an asterisk \* where you would usually put in the email address that the rule should apply to.

Insert a template into an email

This can be any of the Tuta domains or of your own domains that you have added to your Tuta account. Before doing this, you need to upgrade to a paid subscription. **Please note**: Aliases with a Tuta domain can only be disabled, but not removed. Deactivated aliases must remain linked to your account in case you want to activate them again in the future. When you are using your own domain with Tuta, you can delete aliases with your own domain and create new ones.

Setting the administrator for users

Copy link

* The global admin can create a local admin group to add as well as manage administrators of users and contact forms. Please refer to ['Create a local admin group'](https://tuta.com/support#local-admin-create) for details.
* The user who creates another user or contact form becomes the administrator of the created entity. More precisely, the admin group in which the user is a member will become the admin of the entity. If the user is a global admin, then the entity is administrated by the global admins. If the user is a local admin (i.e. member of a local admin group), then that local admin group becomes the admin.
* The global admin can change the administrator of a user by selecting a local admin group under 'Administrated by'.
* Local administrators only see those users and contact forms that they administrate.
* Even if an entity is administrated by a local admin group, the global admins can still administrate the entity.
* A contact form is always administrated by the administrator of its receiving mailbox. So if a global admin changes the receiving mailbox of a contact form, the admin of this user mailbox becomes the administrator of the contact form.

Global settings

Copy link

 ![Global settings](/resources/images/faq/global-settings-desktop-screen.png)

* 'Spam rules': Click on 'Show' to show all defined spam rules. Click the plus symbol to add rules.

[Details on using custom email domains with Tuta can be found in our FAQ](https://tuta.com/support#custom-domain). Next to each custom email domain is a three dot symbol. When you click it, you can 'Set a catch all mailbox' or 'Delete' this domain. If you select 'Set a catch all mailbox', you have to choose to which email address (=which inbox) catch-all mails should go to. This is usually your main admin, but can be any user that you have added to your account. All emails that are being sent to your own domain that do not match any existing email address will be delivered to the catch-all mailbox.
* 'Security': By Clicking the pen symbol, you can force your users to change their password after an administrator has reset the password. Please note: Only administrators of paid accounts can reset the passwords of their own users, e.g. all users of a custom domain. [Tuta as the mail service provider cannot reset your passwords for security reasons](https://tuta.com/support#access-lost).
* 'Audit log': This log is only visible to admins of paid Tuta accounts. It contains important administrative actions, e.g. if you have added a second factor to one of your user accounts, or if you have changed the password of one of your user accounts.

Whitelabel Tuta with your branding

Copy link

When you order the Whitelabel feature, you have two options: The Whitelabel feature is already included in the Pro subscription. Alternatively, you can order it separately in your paid account. Your whitelabel domain can be any subdomain, and might look like 'secure.mycompany.com' or 'email.mycompany.com'. In order to setup whitelabel you must be able to set the CNAME DNS entry.

The DNS entry should look like this: '< subdomain\_name > CNAME login.tutanota.com'. Depending on your hoster you might have to set the fields 'name' to '< subdomain\_name >', 'type' to 'CNAME' and 'value' to 'login.tutanota.com'. Keep in mind that the DNS changes may take a while until propagated.
* Enter this subdomain under 'Whitelabel domain'.

#### Whitelabel domain customizations

How do I register the desktop client as the default email app?

Copy link

**Windows**: Go to Settings > Apps > Default Apps to choose Tuta as you default email app.

**Mac**:  
\* macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer: Open the Apple Mail App and go to Mail -> Settings -> set "Default email reader" to "Tuta Mail.app"  
\* Older Versions: Go to Settings -> Desktop -> set "Default email handler" to "Registered".

**Linux**: This depends on your distribution. Please refer to the relevant documentation. Useful keywords are "mailto handler", "protocol handler"

On all platforms, you may have to tell applications like your internet browser to use the system default mail app.

How do I install the Tuta desktop client?

Copy link

**Mac**: Double-click the installer and follow the instructions on your computer.

**Linux**: After downloading, right click the AppImage and give it execute permission. Alternatively, run `chmod +x tutanota-desktop-linux.AppImage` from a terminal window. Now you can run the App like any other executable, no further installation is required. You may want to let it integrate itself with your desktop and app launcher.

**Windows**: Double-click on the Tuta app and follow the instructions on your computer.

**Enterprise mode (Windows)**: The desktop client can be installed on Windows in "enterprise mode" by passing the following flags to the installer:

* /S - Install silently (no wizard)
* /allusers - Install for all users on the system rather than just the current user (requires privilege escalation)
* /disableAutoUpdates - Disable automatic updates (updates would need to be done manually by an admin)

The application may also be uninstalled silently, by passing /S to the uninstaller (in the installation directory under Program Files).

What can I do if my browser does not recognize the desktop client as my mailto app?

Copy link

Sometimes the browser does not recognize the newly installed Tuta desktop client as the default mailto app. If clicking a mailto-link does not open an email in the desktop client, please make sure that the Tuta desktop client is activated as the default email app in your system settings as described above.

If everything is set up correctly, these instructions might help to troubleshoot:

**Firefox**

* Enter "about:preferences" in the address field.
* Go to "Applications" -> mailto set to "Tuta Desktop" or "Standard"
* Enter "about:config" in the address field
* Set "network.protocol-handler.expose.mailto = true"
* Set "network.protocol-handler.external.mailto = true"

**Chrome**

* Enter "chrome://settings/handlers" in the address field
* Deactivate all handlers for emails

Does the Windows desktop client include MAPI support?

Copy link

The Windows desktop client comes with MAPI support. Via the context menu of a file -> Send to... -> Email recipient - you can directly attach files to a new email.

In various programs (Office, Adobe Acrobat Reader, SAGE50) you can use the "Send document as mail" function and attach the currently opened file to a new email. You can find more details [on our blog](https://tuta.com/blog/desktop-clients-tutanota).

How can I receive notifications with the desktop client?

Copy link

You need to activate the 'Run in background' option to receive notifications from the desktop client. This option appears in your notification area on Windows and in the Tray on Linux.

When it is active, the desktop client will not terminate when all windows are closed and instead remain in the background to provide desktop notifications in case of incoming email or calendar alarms.

If you can't see the tray icon on Linux despite the app running and the 'Run in background' option being set to 'Yes', please refer to your distribution's documentation to enable tray icons or AppIndicators. On MacOS, this option is not visible, and the dock icon is always used to provide a context menu.

If you still do not receive notifications, please check that you do not have focus mode, alarms only, or do not disturb modes on. You can also check the desktop settings of the client.

How do I uninstall the desktop client?

Copy link

**Windows**: Hit the windows key, type "apps", choose the entry "Apps & Features". In the settings window, search for "Tuta Desktop". Click it and then click the "Uninstall" Button.

**Mac**: Right-click the Application in the Applications folder and select "Move to bin". To remove the app cache as well, you need to delete the directory `~/Library/Application Support/tutanota-desktop/`, for example via the terminal:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/
    rm -r ./tutanota-desktop
    

**Linux**:

* Delete the AppImage, then delete the file `~/.local/share/applications/appimagekit-tutanota-desktop.desktop` and the directory `~/.config/tutanota-desktop/` if they're present.
    
* If you want to remove the icons, too, open a terminal window and type
    

    cd ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/
    ls **/*/appimagekit-tutanota-desktop.png
    

* Make sure the output only lists tutanota-desktop image files, then type

    rm  -i **/*/appimagekit-tutanota-desktop.png

How do I verify the signature of the desktop client?

Copy link

The Tuta desktop applications for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS are signed. The signatures make sure that the desktop clients as well as any updates come directly from us and have not been tampered with. Upon every update, the desktop client automatically checks that the signature is valid.

You can verify the authenticity of your manually downloaded installer with the OpenSSL utility yourself as well. It should be installed on most Linux and Mac systems, but needs to be added to Windows, [you can get OpenSSL via this link](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries).

The installer signatures are provided as separate files:

* [Signature for Windows](https://app.tuta.com/desktop/win-sig.bin)
* [Signature for Mac (dmg)](https://app.tuta.com/desktop/mac-sig-dmg.bin)
* [Signature for Mac (zip)](https://app.tuta.com/desktop/mac-sig-zip.bin)
* [Signature for Linux](https://app.tuta.com/desktop/linux-sig.bin)

Tuta uses its own Captcha so that we do not have to depend on using Google Captcha. This enables us to offer an [open source email service without any links to Google](https://tuta.com/open-source).

The Tuta Captcha shows a clock. If applicable, you need to enter the displayed time with four numerals, including the colon in the middle. If the displayed time is 8.30 for example, you have to enter 08:30 or 20:30 exactly.

What are alias email addresses?

Copy link

An email alias is an additional email address that you can use within your mailbox. Tuta lets you add five or more aliases in any of the paid versions. You can use these alias email addresses for both receiving and sending secure emails.

Alias email addresses can be set up if you would like several email addresses to be linked to one inbox.

For example, as a private user, you might want to have different alias addresses for different purposes, e.g. youraddress@tutanota.com, shopping.youraddress@tutanota.com, newsletters.youraddress@tutanota.com etc.

As a business, you might want several email addresses for different purposes to go to one centrally managed inbox, e.g. support@yourcompany.com, sales@yourcompany.com, jobs@yourcompany.com etc.

What are users?

Copy link

As a family or organization using Tuta, you can set up users for each family member or employee. These users get a separate mailbox, including contacts and calendars, accessible via their personal login credentials.

When you sign up for Tuta, you create an email **account**. This account initially has a single user which is also an administrator. With any paid subscription, you can add multiple users to your account. As an admin you can manage the users (deactivate a user, change a password or remove a second factor). You may also allow multiple users to be administrators.

How to setup a catch-all email address

Copy link

1. First you need to complete the setup process of your custom domain.
    
2. Go to Settings -> Global Settings -> Custom email domains.
    
3. Next to each custom email domain is a three dot symbol. When you click it, you can select 'Set a catch all mailbox'. Then you need to choose to which email address and, consequently, to which of your inboxes catch-all mails should go to. This is usually your main admin, but can be any user that you have added to your account.
    

Once you have set up your catch-all email address, all emails that are being sent to your own domain that do not match any existing email address will be delivered to this catch-all inbox.

Tip: If your domain got leaked to spam lists, we recommend that you set up a dedicated user within your Tuta account for receiving catch-all emails, e.g. catchall@yourdomain.com.

A catch-all email address lets you receive all emails sent to your custom domain – even if the sender mistyped your email address.

In Tuta you can set up a catch-all email address with any [paid subscription](https://tuta.com/pricing).

How to import a user list via CSV

Copy link

If you have a large number of users, you can import a CSV file containing user name, email address and password. This is useful to automatically create all users in a single step.

To import all users via CSV, you need to create a CSV file with the items 'name', 'email address' and 'password' that contains all users for your company. Then you login with your admin to Tuta and go to 'Settings' → 'User management' →  '...' → 'Import Users'

You can then provide the user passwords to the users, so they can log in into their individual mailboxes.
