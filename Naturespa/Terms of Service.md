In returning your NatureSpa product, please follow these three (3) steps:

Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the product, send an email at [uspport@naturespashowerpurifier.com](mailto:support@naturespashowerpurifier.com) and indicate your intent to return and your reason.

2.

3.

After you have shipped the unit, email us your tracking number. Once the tracking confirms the delivery, we will not bill you with the price of the product returned. Not providing the tracking information within the time period provided herein may cause us to bill you for the product.

Not returning the product to us may cause us to bill you for the product. Buyer assumes responsibility for return shipping costs. The product must be returned with all parts, components and packaging as it was received. Unless carefully packed in the original inner and outer packaging (or equivalent), the return will not be accepted by us. That said, the trial phase is for thoroughly testing all the given features so that customers can make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with NatureSpa. We definitely want you to open the box!

Note: Reason for return is only asked so we can continue to improve our products and services. You may return your product during the return period for any reason or no reason at all. Please do not confuse warranty period with trial period. Warranties do not extend the duration of any trial period.
