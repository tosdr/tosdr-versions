Privacy Policy
==============

Welcome to Envato’s Privacy Policy
----------------------------------

1. Hi there, we’re Envato Pty Ltd (ABN 11 119 159 741) of PO Box 16122 Collins Street West, Victoria 8007 Australia and welcome to our privacy policy. This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re an Envato user or visitor to our Sites. It applies across all our sites, including Envato Elements, Envato Market, Envato Studio, Envato Sites, Envato Tuts+ and Placeit (the “**Sites**”) and our products, features, services, software applications, programs, add-ons, extensions, plug-ins, and other technologies we may develop or use from time to time (the “**Products**”). This policy applies to us and our affiliates, including Envato Elements Pty Ltd, Envato Sites Pty Ltd, Envato Placeit Pty Ltd and Sonley Bell Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“**Envato**”).
2. All Envato employees, agents and contractors are responsible for protecting personal information collected and processed by Envato. It is the responsibility of all Envato employees, agents and contractors to assist in the protection of personal information by acting in accordance with this policy.
3. When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘Envato’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites and/or Products.
4. If you are in a country whose privacy laws use the concept of data controller and processor, for example in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), United Kingdom (“UK”), or Mexico, then:

1. we are the ‘data controller’ of personal information related to your account, and to the delivery of our services and subscriptions to you;
2. please be aware that PayPal acts as an independent data controller in the context of processing your personal information where we use PayPal Braintree to facilitate and process transactions from our Sites and/or Products. PayPal’s privacy statement is available at [braintreepayments.com](https://www.braintreepayments.com/au/legal/braintree-privacy-policy).

6. If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using each of the Sites and/or Products. The rules vary by product and each product makes them separately available and seeks consent to them separately from this policy.

The type of personal information we collect
-------------------------------------------

6. We collect certain personal information about visitors and users of our Sites and/or Products.
7. The most common types of information we collect include things like: user-names, member names, email addresses, IP addresses, other contact details, survey responses, blogs, photos, payment information such as payment agent details, transactional details, tax information, support queries, forum comments (if applicable), content you direct us to make available on our Sites and/or Products (such as item descriptions and other information you choose to make available on your profile) and, your actions on our Sites and/or Products (including any selections or inputs into items, or text or image prompts) and web and email analytics data. We will also collect personal information from job applications (such as your CV, the application form itself, cover letter and interview notes) and from correspondence between you and us when you contact us.
8. We also collect information about your device and your interactions with our Sites using cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. For more information on the types of information we collect automatically, please read the section on cookies below and our [Cookie Policy](https://www.envato.com/cookies/#:~:text=Cookies%2C%20clear%20gifs%20and%20similar,our%20business%20partners%20and%20authors.).

How we collect personal information
-----------------------------------

9. We collect personal information:

1. directly when you provide it to us. For example, when you complete forms such as free trials, membership, email list, subscription or competition registrations, when you submit feedback or send us any other type of communication, or when you make transactions such as buying or providing services on our Sites or Products;
2. automatically as you navigate through the Sites and/or Products;
3. indirectly through other businesses that provide services associated with the Sites and/or Products, when you use those services, explained in further detail at paragraph 11.

11. As the operator of digital content marketplaces and subscription services, we have a legitimate interest in verifying the identity of our authors. We believe that knowing who our authors are will strengthen the integrity of our marketplaces and subscription services by reducing fraud, making authors more accountable for their content and giving Envato and customers the ability to enforce contracts for authors who break the rules. Envato also has certain legal obligations that require us to know who our authors are in certain circumstances. In light of this, if you are an author we will verify your identity, in particular, your name, full address and date of birth by asking you to show us a Photo ID document. The verification procedure is called Envato Verify. Envato Verify will be carried out by our service provider Jumio Corporation located at 395 Page Mill Road, Suite 150, Palo Alto, California, United States of America (“USA”). As part of Envato Verify, you will be asked to take a selfie which will then be compared against your Photo ID document using facial recognition technology. We will use your Photo ID document and your selfie solely to carry out Envato Verify and delete it after the completion of this process. If you are located in Australia, the EEA or the UK or Mexico, we will only process your biometric information or other sensitive personal information with your explicit consent.

Personal information we collect about you from others
-----------------------------------------------------

11. Although we generally collect personal information directly from you, on occasion, we also collect certain categories of personal information about you from other sources. In particular, this may include:
    1. financial and/or transaction details from payment providers located in USA, UK, and Australia in order to process a transaction;
    2. third party service providers (like Google and Facebook) who are located in various countries, including USA, UK, Mexico, Uruguay or Vietnam which may provide information about you when you link, connect, or login to your account with the third party provider and they send us information such as your registration and profile from that service. The information varies and is controlled by that service provider or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service provider; and
    3. other third party sources/and or partners from various countries, including Australia, USA, Mexico, Uruguay or Vietnam whereby we receive additional information about you (to the extent permitted by applicable law), such as demographic data or fraud detection information, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, fraud warnings from service providers like our identity verification service. We also receive information about you and your activities, experiences and interactions on and off the Sites and/or Products through partnerships with our partner ad networks. We also receive information about you as a rights holder from our third party authors. For example, information in the form of a model release when your image is used in an item made available on our Sites and/or Products; and
    4. the Subscriber of the account, if you’re a member of a team, agency or other organisation that uses our Sites and/or Products.

Where we transfer and/or store your personal information
--------------------------------------------------------

15. We are based in Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and USA so when your data is transferred to us it will be processed in those countries. Some of the recipients we have described in the section 14 above, and to whom we disclose your personal information, are based around the world including in places like Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Romania, UK, USA, India, Uruguay, Vietnam, New Zealand, Singapore, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Philippines, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and Israel. These countries may not provide the same protections as the data protection laws where you are based. When we transfer data to these recipients, we do this on the basis of this policy and we will ensure that relevant safeguards are in place to afford adequate protection for your personal information and we will comply with applicable data protection laws. For example, if you are in the EEA or the UK we may rely on a UK government adequacy regulation or adequacy decision by the European Commission, on contractual protections for the transfer of your personal information or a derogation if available. We also take care to work with subcontractors and service providers who we believe maintain an acceptable standard of data security compliance.
16. Where you are located in New Zealand, by providing us with your personal information, you authorise us to disclose that personal information to the recipients described in the section above (including those recipients that may not be required to protect your personal information in a way that provides comparable safeguards to those under the data protection laws where you are based).

How we keep your personal information secure
--------------------------------------------

17. We store personal information on secure servers that are managed by us and our service providers, and occasionally hard copy files that are kept in a secure location in Australia, Ireland, Mexico, USA and New Zealand. We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, loss, disclosure, alteration and destruction of the personal information we process, including username and password authentication, two-factor authentication, and data encryption where appropriate. Unfortunately, data transmission over the internet cannot be guaranteed as completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security.

Your rights relating to your personal information
-------------------------------------------------

18. Depending on the jurisdiction you are located in, you may have the following rights, as provided under applicable law and subject to any limitations in such law:

1. To **access** the personal information we hold about you;
2. To request **we correct** any inaccurate personal information we hold about you;
3. To request **we delete** any personal information we hold about you;
4. To **restrict** the processing of personal information we hold about you;

20. If you seek to exercise any of the rights described in section 18, we may need to pass on costs that are strictly necessary for the reproduction, modification or sending of personal information to you. Otherwise, your exercise of these rights will be free of charge.
21. These rights are limited in some situations – for example, if we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information. In some instances, this means that we may retain some data even if you withdraw your consent. Note that a request to limit the collection, use, disclosure and storage of your personal information and/or the deletion of personal information during your relationship with Envato will be taken into consideration in accordance with the internal procedures, legal needs and legal obligations that Envato may be subject to under applicable legislation in each country.

You can also close the account you have with us for any of our Sites at any time.

To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we use your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and other applicable legal requirements.
