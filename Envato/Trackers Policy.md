Cookie Policy
=============

1. This policy explains how Envato Pty Ltd and its affiliates (we, us, our) use cookies and similar tracking technologies (cookies) on our websites.
2. This policy applies to all of the websites that we operate including but not limited to Elements, Envato Market, Envato Studio, Envato Sites, Envato Tuts+, Deblank, Freeflo, Placeit and all related domains.

What Cookies Are
----------------

3. Cookies are small data files that are created when you browse a website, and which are sent to your computer or mobile device where they are stored by your web browser. Cookies serve a variety of functions, including things like keeping track of items in the shopping basket of an online shop, enabling you to stay logged into a website, or tracking web browsing activity and recording which buttons a user has clicked or which websites they have recently visited.
4. Clear gifs, pixel trackers and web beacons work similarly to cookies. They are tiny graphics that are embedded invisibly on web pages, with a unique identifier that can track a user’s activity on and between web pages and websites that they visit.
5. All references to cookies in this policy also include references to clear gifs, pixel trackers, web beacons and similar tracking technologies.

Types of Cookies that we use
----------------------------

6. Envato uses the following categories of cookies:
    1. **Necessary cookies:** Necessary cookies help make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation, website security, and access to information that requires authentication.
    2. **Preferences:** These cookies enable storage of information that changes the way a website behaves or looks, like language settings for your country.
    3. **Statistics and Performance:** These cookies help us to understand who visits our websites, including using anonymised and aggregated audience profiling analytics, and how visitors interact with our websites, including which parts of the websites are visited more or less frequently than others, so we can improve the way that information is available on those sites.
    4. **Marketing**: Marketing cookies are used for tracking your browsing activity and to customise and display advertisements that are relevant and engaging. This involves:
        1. Envato using cookies to share information with third parties about the way that users navigate to and use our websites, so that those third parties can show users advertising that’s relevant to their use of our websites; and
        2. Envato receiving cookies from third parties about the way that users have used other websites, so that Envato can show them advertising relevant to their use of third party websites.

Information that cookies collect and share
------------------------------------------

7. The information that cookies on Envato’s websites collect includes, but is not limited to:

1. The way that you use our websites, including the pages you visit, the buttons and items that you click on, how long you spend on different sections of the websites and the items that you view and download;
2. Search terms and filters that you use;
3. Information about the device, operating system and web browser you use to visit our websites; including the type of device, your browser type and version, session identifiers;
4. Text entered into forms such as your Envato username;
5. Language preference; and
6. Location.

How to manage your preferences and settings
-------------------------------------------

8. You can choose your preferred cookie settings by using our cookie banner, which will either open automatically when you visit our websites, or can be opened from the “Cookie Settings” link in the footer on any of our websites.
9. You can choose which categories of cookies will be used by toggling the on/off switches in the banner.
10. If you decide that you want to change your cookie settings, you can re-open the cookie banner using the “Cookie Settings” link in the footer on any of our websites. However, please note that if you have previously disabled one or more cookie categories, we may still use information previously collected from cookies that were set prior to you subsequently disabling them. We will stop using the disabled cookie to collect any further information.
11. Our websites are split into different sections called domains. For example, themeforest and codecanyon are different domains within Envato Market. When you select your cookie preferences in one domain, that selection may not always be applied consistently to a different domain on our websites. If that happens, then the cookie banner may appear in that separate domain and you can make your selection for that part of our website. This will not affect the settings for any earlier cookie choices that you’ve made in a different domain.
12. Your cookie setting choices will not be tracked across different web browsers, e.g. between Chrome and Firefox, so if you choose your cookie settings in one browser, you may receive a cookie banner the first time you visit the same website using a different web browser.
13. Please keep in mind that cookies can change the way our website works, so the quality of your experience on our website may be affected if you turn off performance and preference cookies.
14. The use of ad blockers or similar tools may interfere with our cookie banner, preventing it from appearing.
15. You can also make changes to the way that your web browser uses cookies directly in your web browser’s settings.

Do not sell or share my personal information
--------------------------------------------

16. We don’t sell your personal information, but the way that we advertise our products to you on different platforms including third party websites is considered in some states in the USA, including in California, to amount to sharing or disclosure of your personal information. If you don’t want us to do that, then you should:

1. click on the “Cookie Settings” link in the footer of any of our websites. This will open our cookie banner, where you can switch off “Marketing” under the Details section, and then click “Save preferences”; and
2. email us at [\[email protected\]](https://envato.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Just write "Do not sell or share my personal information" in the subject line and let us know your name, the email address linked with your account and the Envato service or services that you use, and we’ll do the rest. A representative can also make this request on your behalf. In order to do that, they’ll need to provide evidence that they are authorised to make any such request on your behalf.

18. Further information about the way we use your personal information is set out in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.envato.com/privacy/).
