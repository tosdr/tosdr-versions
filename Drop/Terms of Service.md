These links are provided for your reference and convenience only, and do not necessarily imply any endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of the material on these third-party websites or online services or any association with their operators. In addition, Corsair will not and cannot control or edit the content of any third-party website or online service. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY RELEASE THE CORSAIR PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF ANY THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE OR ONLINE SERVICES AND FROM ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY SORT YOU MAY INCUR FROM DEALING WITH ANY THIRD PARTY. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions of use for each other third party website or online service that you visit.

13\. CONTESTS AND PROMOTIONS

Unless otherwise stated, promotions are valid only in the countries in which they are applicable. Corsair reserves the right to modify the terms of or discontinue any contests and/or promotions at any time for any reason, including but not limited to product availability, pricing issues, reduced demand. Prizes, discounts and special pricing may be changed or substituted at any time without prior notice. Taxes on any prize or award are the sole responsibility of the recipient.

14\. PRICING AND PAYMENT
------------------------

1. **Transactions**.  If you wish to purchase goods or use services made available by or through Corsair, as described on the Service (each such activity, a "Transaction"), you may be asked to supply certain information applicable to your Transaction, including, without limitation, credit card and other information. Any information that you provide to Corsair will be handled in the manner described in our Privacy Policy. You agree that all information that you provide in connection with your Transaction will be accurate, current and complete. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card at the price(s) set forth on the Service at the time of your Transaction, however, such prices do not include and you must pay any excise, sales, use, or like taxes associated with the Transaction. Prices advertised on the Service are subject to increase in the amount of any such tax that Corsair may be required to collect or pay in connection with the Transaction. You are responsible for (and will indemnify the Corsair Parties against) all taxes associated with Transactions entered into by you or users of your account through the Service (excepting taxes based on Corsair’s income).
    
    You agree that you will not attempt to conceal your identity by using multiple Internet Protocol addresses or email addresses to use or to enter Transactions on the Service. You grant Corsair the right to provide any information you submit to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction.
    
  
3. **No Offers**.  Statements made on the Service concerning our products or services do not constitute an offer, but are merely solicitations of an offer, where appropriate. References to and information concerning products and services on the Service are not complete and must be read in conjunction with the specific information accompanying such products, as the same may change from time to time.
  
5. **Other Agreements/Terms of Sale**.  All products and services sold by us via the Service are sold in accordance with any terms of sale separately provided related to such sales. You may, from time to time, enter into additional written agreements with Corsair in connection with other products, services, or events made available by or through Corsair. In the event that any terms or provisions of such a written agreement or terms of sale conflict with the provisions of these Terms of Use, the terms and provisions of the written agreement or terms of sale shall prevail.
  
7. **Pricing**.  Pricing for Transactions shall be as set forth on the Service, which pricing may be changed by Corsair from time to time. Corsair may choose to temporarily change pricing for promotional events or new products or services, and such changes shall be immediately effective when Corsair posts the temporary pricing change to the Service.
  
9. **Payment Processing**.  When you conduct a Transaction, processing of the Transaction and collection of payments may be handled by our payment processor. Transactions will be processed only after a billing address, and other billing information, has been verified. If We receive incorrect billing or credit card account information, the processing of your Transaction will be cancelled without further notice.
  
11. **Transaction Confirmation**.  If you do not receive a confirmation number (in the form of a confirmation page or email) after submitting payment information, or if you experience an error message or service interruption after submitting payment information, it is your responsibility to confirm with Corsair whether or not your Transaction has been completed.
  
13. **Refunds**.  Before entering a Transaction on the Service, carefully review the Service and all policies and terms. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Corsair, Corsair will not issue refunds. In the event that the provisions of this Section conflict with any mandatory refund policies imposed by our payment processor, as may be applicable to a particular Transaction, the terms of such mandatory refund policy shall prevail. Additionally, certain legislation and consumer protection laws and regulations may confer you with rights, warranties, guarantees and remedies relating to your Transaction that cannot be excluded, restricted, or modified.
  
15. **Chargebacks**.  You agree that you will not attempt to circumvent any refund prohibitions with regard to Transactions on the Service. You will not dispute or otherwise seek a "chargeback" from the company whose credit card you used on the Service. Should you do so, your access may be cancelled, and Corsair may, in its sole discretion, refuse to honor pending and future Transactions made from all credit card accounts or online accounts on which such chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit all persons in whose name the credit card accounts exist, and any person who accesses any associated online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches this provision, from using the Service.
