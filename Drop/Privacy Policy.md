Targeted Advertising

We may engage in targeted advertising. This form of advertising includes various parties and service providers engaged in the processing of Personal Data in connection with advertising tailored to individual interests.

You may have certain rights and choices regarding the Personal Data we process. Please note these rights may vary based on the country or state where you reside, and our obligations under applicable law. Additional rights and disclosures for residents of the EEA, UK, Switzerland, California, Nevada, and other jurisdictions are described further below.

### Marketing Communications

You can withdraw your consent to receive marketing communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in an email or by submitting a request using the information below.

### Withdrawing Your Consent/Opt-Out/Opt-Out of Sales

Where we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent, you may change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time. The consequence of you withdrawing consent might be that we cannot perform certain services for you.

### Submission and Verification

To exercise your rights under applicable law, you may email us at [data.controller@corsair.com](mailto:data.controller@corsair.com). If you decide to exercise your rights, to help protect the security of your Personal Data, you will be asked to verify your identity. There may be situations where we cannot grant your request, e.g. if Corsair is legally obligated to keep Personal Data to comply with applicable law. We may also decline to grant a request where our legitimate use of the data outweighs individual privacy concerns, e.g. in relation to anti-fraud and security purposes, or a request for deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. We may also deny your privacy request if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, and where applicable law allows the denial.

DATA RETENTION
--------------

We retain Personal Data for so long as it, in our discretion, is necessary to achieve the processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy, and in any event, for so long as is required by law or necessary to provide the Service. We will review retention periods periodically and may sometimes pseudonymize or anonymize data held for longer periods. We may also retain and use your Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or for the period required or permitted by laws in applicable jurisdictions. Please note that some or all of the Personal Data we have collected may be required for the Service to function properly.

CORSAIR’S SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA
----------------------------------

Corsair may share Personal Data within our Affiliates and with service providers who act on our behalf, our partners, or others at your direction.

* **Service Providers**. Corsair may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, delivering products to customers. Corsair’s service providers are obligated to handle Personal Data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions.
* **Affiliates**. To streamline business operations and develop products and services that better meet the interests and needs of our customers and to inform our customers about relevant products and services, we may share your Personal Data with any of our current or future Affiliates.
* **Partners**. At times, Corsair may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Corsair offers financing in cooperation with partners who manage the extension of credit and financing offers. We may share Personal Data with these partners, and they may process Personal Data for their own purposes as a separate controller, or share certain Personal Data with Corsair, each as set forth in the applicable privacy policy.
* **Social Media/Advertisers**. To improve personalization, deliver more relevant advertisements to you and others, and develop better products and services, we may share certain Personal Data with third parties for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes, and we may allow third parties (such as Facebook and social media advertisers, ad exchanges, data management platforms, or ad servers) to operate on our Service and process data for targeted advertising. These transfers may be made for commercial purposes and in connection with data sales.
* **Data Aggregators**. In connection with our marketing operations, we may share certain Personal Data with data aggregators to help us better personalize our services, enrich Consumer Profiles and help ensure that you see advertisements that are more relevant to your interests.
* **Successors**. Any Personal Data may be processed in the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation, sale of all or a portion of our assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or other transaction. For example, Personal Data may be part of the assets transferred, or may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process for a potential transaction.
* **Others**. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users.

PROTECTION OF DATA AT CORSAIR
-----------------------------

We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Data, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data and the processing, and the threats posed. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate and reasonable in connection with the risk of processing your Personal Data.

While we take reasonable measures to protect Personal Data against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No Internet, email, or mobile application transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Email or other messages sent through the Service may not be secure.

TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA BETWEEN COUNTRIES
-------------------------------------------

We operate in and use service providers located in the United States. If you are located outside the U.S., your Personal Data may be transferred to the U.S. The U.S. does not provide the same legal protections guaranteed to Personal Data in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland. Accordingly, your Personal Data may be transferred to the U.S. pursuant to the Standard Contractual Clauses or other adequacy mechanisms or pursuant to exemptions provided under EU law. Contact us for additional information regarding the mechanisms to ensure adequate protection of data subject to these laws.

CHILDREN
--------

Except in limited cases described below or in our Supplemental Privacy Notices, our Service is not directed at users under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from minors unless we have the necessary consent from the child, parent, or guardian. If you have reason to believe that we may have accidentally received Personal Data from a minor, please contact us immediately at [data.controller@corsair.com](mailto:data.controller@corsair.com).

Designated portions of our Service, such as Gamer Sensei, may be used by children under the age of majority with the consent of Parents/Guardians. As Parents/Guardians, if you consent to your child’s use of the Service, we may collect and process certain additional Personal Data. Where we handle the Personal Data of children under the age of majority in the applicable jurisdiction, Parents/Guardians may have certain rights in their child’s Personal Data under applicable law. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act gives Parents/Guardians the right to access, correct, and delete their child’s Personal Data (subject to limited exceptions). Additional information regarding Parents/Guardians’ consent, supplemental processing of Personal Data, and the rights of Parents/Guardians in relation to the Gamer Sensei service is available in the Gamer Sensei Privacy Supplement.

### EEA/UK/Swiss Privacy Rights

Users based in the EEA/UK/Switzerland (“User”) have the following legal rights with respect to their information:

* The right to require Corsair to confirm whether or not their information is being processed, the purpose of any such processing, the recipients of any information that has been disclosed, the period for which their information is to be stored, and whether any automated decision-making processes are used in relation to their information;
* The right to require Corsair to rectify inaccurate information without undue delay;
* The right to request the erasure of their information. Subject to certain conditions, Corsair may be required to erase the information in response to such request where:
    * the information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected, such as where a User chooses to terminate his or her use of the Service;
    * the processing of the information is based on the User’s consent (and the other circumstances described in the Legal Bases for Processing Your Information and Corsair’s Sharing of Personal Data sections above no longer apply), if the User withdraws his or her consent; or
    * the User objects to the processing of his or her information and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing.
* Where Corsair has disclosed the information of an EEA/UK user to a third party and the user requests the erasure or rectification of the data, Corsair will take all reasonable steps to inform the third party of such request.
* The right to restrict Corsair from processing User information in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of that information is disputed or an objection has been raised (see below). In such circumstances, Corsair will only process that information with the express consent of the User, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest;
* User’s right to receive their information from Corsair in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format;

### Your California Privacy Rights

Right to Delete

You have the right to delete certain Personal Data that we hold about you, subject to exceptions under applicable law.

Direct Marketing

You may request a list of Personal Data we have disclosed about you to third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.

Right to Know

You may request that, for Personal Data that we have collected in the preceding 12 months, we disclose, free of charge (unless your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive) (1) the categories of Personal Data we have collected about you, or that we have sold, or disclosed for a Commercial Purpose; (2) the categories of sources from which your Personal Data was collected; (3) the business or Commercial Purpose for which we collected or sold your Personal Data; (4) the categories of third parties to whom we have sold your Personal Data or disclosed it for a business purpose; and (5) the specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you.

Do Not Sell My Personal Information

You may direct us, at any time, not to sell your Personal Data. We may sell personal information as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). Under the CCPA, “sell” means sell, rent, release, disclose, disseminate, make available, transfer, or otherwise communicate orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means a consumer’s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. The law contains exceptions to this definition which may limit how we respond to your direction.

Nondiscrimination

We may not discriminate against you because you exercised any of your rights under the CCPA, including, but not limited to, by: (A) denying goods or services to you; (B) charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; (C) providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you; or (D) suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, nothing prohibits us from charging you a different price or rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by your data.

We may offer financial incentives, including payments to you as compensation, for the collection of personal information, the sale of personal information, the retention of personal information, or the deletion of personal information. We may also offer a different price, rate, level, or quality of goods or services to you if that price or difference is directly related to the value provided to us by your data.

### Submission of Requests

To exercise this right to opt out, you may email us at [data.controller@corsair.com](mailto:data.controller@corsair.com).

### Verification of Requests

Before we can fulfill the requests to know and delete your personal information , we must verify your identity. If you have a password-protected account with us, we can verify your identity through our existing authentication procedures for your account. However, we will require you to re-authenticate yourself before we can disclose or delete any of your personal information.

If you do not have a password-protected account with us, we will require you to provide us with two types of information to verify your identity. This information may include your name, telephone number, email address, or home address, as well as supplemental information, such as purchase data or other unique information in your account. We may also require you to provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. We will match this information to the Personal Data we maintain.

You can also authorize another person, called an agent, to exercise your rights on your behalf. You must provide the authorized agent written and signed permission to act on your behalf. We may deny requests to opt out from an authorized agent who does not submit proof that he or she has been authorized to act on your behalf. Furthermore, we may require you to verify your identity directly with us. We may also require you to directly confirm with us that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit a request on your behalf. An authorized agent can make a request on your behalf by emailing us at [data.controller@corsair.com](mailto:data.controller@corsair.com).
