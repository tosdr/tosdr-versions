**ID.** ID providers manage and distribute unique identifiers associated with users across various digital platforms. Unique identifiers are pieces of information assigned to individual users to track their activities and preferences across different websites and apps. These identifiers help advertisers and platforms understand user behaviour and deliver personalised ads. Due to the changing privacy-landscape, ID providers are adapting by finding ways to maintain personalised advertising capabilities while respecting user privacy. This might involve using anonymized or aggregated data, implementing stricter data protection measures (e.g., encryption), and providing users with more control over their data and ad preferences. Encryption scrambles for example your email address into a secret code that can only be deciphered with a decryption key. We work with among others the following ID providers:

[Unified ID2.0](https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/about-us/industry-initiatives/unified-id-solution-2-0) - [for privacy policy click here](https://www.thetradedesk.com/general/privacy)

[Criteo](https://www.criteo.com/) - [for privacy policy click here](https://www.criteo.com/privacy/):Criteo uses a pseudonymized email address. Criteo and CrazyGames share responsibility as joint-controllers. You can opt-out of this use via the Disable button on [https://www.criteo.com/privacy](https://www.criteo.com/privacy).

[LiveRamp](https://liveramp.com/) - [for privacy policy click here](https://liveramp.com/privacy/): LiveRamp uses an encrypted email address. You can opt out of this use directly via [https://liveramp.com/opt\_out](https://liveramp.com/opt_out).

[Lotame](https://www.lotame.com/) - [for privacy policy click here](https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-notices/services/): Lotame uses pseudonymous and declared IDs. You can opt out of this use directly via their [Privacy Manager](https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-manager).

**Game developers**. Games on our Platform may be our own games or games offered by external game developers. CrazyGames may share specific personal data with such external game developers if that’s strictly required for the performance of our contractual obligations with the game developers. When sharing usage data with a game developer about his game, CrazyGames will always anonymize the data. In addition, if you share feedback with us about a game, we can also share this feedback with the developer of the game.

**Payment providers**. If you make in-game purchases, the transaction is processed by an external payment provider and is subject to the external payment provider's privacy policy.

**International Data Transfers**. CrazyGames may share your personal data outside the European Economic Area. In such a case, CrazyGames will always take appropriate and required measures to protect your data and privacy, including implementing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as Model Clauses) or UK International Data Transfer Addendums where necessary to provide safeguards for your personal data.

Should you need further details regarding how we transfer data internationally and the protective measures we employ, please reach out to us via email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.crazygames.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or through [our contact form](https://www.crazygames.com/contact)

When we use external providers to help us with the processing of your personal data (“**Processor**”), we will always ensure that your personal data is handled confidentially and in a safe manner. We also always draw up a contract with these Processors. This way the Processor will never be allowed to use your personal data on its own initiative and your personal data has to be erased as soon as the Processor has completed the assignment for CrazyGames.

If you have any questions on these security measures, feel free to contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.crazygames.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or through [our contact form](https://www.crazygames.com/contact). 3. **IN CHARGE OF YOUR DATA**

### 9\. **Manage your ad preferences**

When you first visit our Websites, you will be prompted to accept, reject or set advertising services according to your preference via our Consent Management Platform (“**CMP**”). You can access this CMP at any time in the menu of our Platform via the "Preferences"-button.

In addition, at the browser level you can manage your cookies by adapting your browser settings. Modern browsers allow you to choose to block cookies or to accept only cookies from specific websites. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Platform. For more information about cookies, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way.

If you would like to learn more about behavioural advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver personalised ads, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving personalised ads from them at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive an “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future. You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads. If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.

Please remember, if you opt-out of behaviorally targeted advertising you will continue to receive ads on our free, ad-supported Platform, but not behaviorally targeted ads. Also, if you opt-out of CrazyGames’s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based or contextual advertising through other companies.

Facebook does not allow children younger than thirteen (13) years of age or the applicable minimum age in the relevant country to create a Facebook account under its current terms of service. If you create an Account using your email, CrazyGames will ask you to confirm that you are older than thirteen (13) years of age.

### 11\. **Links to other websites**

Our Platform or web games of developers may contain links to other websites that do not belong to us. If you click on such a link, you will be directed to that other company's website such as social media. You should check the privacy policy of each website you visit by clicking on such a link.

We have no control over and take no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party websites or services.

### 12\. **Externally hosted games**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of personal data by data controllers other than CrazyGames, such as providers of third-party games available on the Platform. Such game providers may, for example, post their own advertisements, offer their own game accounts or a chat system to talk to other players. We will provide you with an explicit notice when you click to play such a game. The relevant provider of such a third-party game is itself responsible for ensuring that any processing of personal data by it in the context of a game complies with applicable data protection legislation.

In principle, CrazyGames does not allow third-party providers to collect personal data on Platform users. If personal data is nevertheless collected by third-party providers, CrazyGames will require that any processing of personal data by them, for example in the context of a game, complies with applicable legislation.

**Please note that if you choose to play a third-party game, you are playing that game in the environment of that game's third-party developer, over which we have no control. We, therefore, recommend that you read the privacy statement of that game distributor before playing the game. Below are CrazyGames' main gaming partners**:

**Crazygames Cookie Policy**
----------------------------

### 1\. **Who we are**

We are CrazyGames. We offer a browser game platform where you can discover and experience many different web games in an easy way (“**Platform**”). You can access our Platform via an account (“**Account**”) or without. The Platform is made available via one of CrazyGames' websites as visible in the address bar (“**Websites**”).

Legal information about CrazyGames ("**CrazyGames**", "**we**", "**us**"):

KBO 0550.758.377.

### 2\. **What are cookies?**

Cookies are small files that are saved on your computer when you visit web pages. They contain information linked to a web browser and the specific website. They are saved in a specific folder on your hard drive. If you return to a specific website, this page can recognize the visitor by means of the cookie and further elaborate the history. A web beacon is an (often transparent) graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel, that is placed on a website and that is used to monitor the behaviour of the user visiting the website.

Cookies are used to increase visitor-friendliness: by identifying visitors with a cookie, they do not always have to enter the same data such as login information or screen settings every time you visit the website.

In this Cookie Policy, we explain what cookies are, their purposes and which cookies we use on our Websites. More information on your privacy and data protection rights can be found in our Privacy Policy.

### 3\. **What kind of cookies exist?**

Often a distinction is made between two large groups of cookies:

* **First party cookies**: these cookies are created by a website to make the web page function better. They regulate the technical part of a site, such as language choice or remembering the products in the shopping basket in an online store. The visited website creates and places first party cookies.
    
* **Third party cookies**: these cookies are created and placed on your computer by another (third) party than the website you visit. They remember the behaviour of a surfer. Examples are social media such as Facebook or Twitter, but Google Analytics as well. This is the system used most to measure website visits.
    
* Cookies essential for the correct functioning of our Websites do not require permission. All other cookies do.
    

### 4\. **Why do we use Cookies?**

Cookies are generally used to increase visitor-friendliness: by identifying visitors with a cookie, they do not always have to enter the same data such as login information or screen settings every time you visit the Websites. Like other commercial websites, CrazyGames and our authorised, third-party service providers use cookies and other similar information-gathering technologies throughout our Platform to collect certain information automatically and store it in log files for a variety of legitimate business interests and purposes.

CrazyGames and its authorised, third-party service providers use cookies, beacons, and other similar technologies on our Websites either with your consent or for our legitimate business purposes to ensure you can navigate or otherwise use our Websites and access secure areas of our Websites. We also use these technologies for statistical purposes and to analyse and improve the use of our Platform and prepare aggregated usage reports.

CrazyGames wants to inform users as much as possible about the cookies we use. Cookies are essential for us to optimise each visit to the Platform and offer you a better game experience or offer you relevant ads that you might be interested in. For example, cookies remember each choice made by you (e.g. choices related to language, newsletter, etc.) and help offer you all relevant services and suggestions.

### 5\. **What is our legal basis?**

On our free, ad-supported Platform, we use these technologies for our legitimate business purposes of providing standard advertising controls, determining user response to advertisements and promotions, and delivering targeted advertisements that we or our authorised, third-party service providers believe will be of most interest to you.

### 6\. **Which Cookies do we use?**

**First party**. We will only use first party cookies to help improve your user and game experience on the Platform. We would do this by recording specific information about the user such as the language chosen, the pages visited and the duration of the visits.

**Game distributors**. We may offer games from third-party game distributors on our Platform. By playing a third-party game, your personal data may be processed by the third-party game distributor (directly or through the use of cookies or similar technologies). We will provide you with an explicit notice when you click to play such a game.

**Please note that if you choose to play a third-party game, you are playing that game in the environment of that game's third-party developer, over which we have no control. We, therefore, recommend that you read the privacy statement of that game distributor before playing the game. Below are CrazyGames' main gaming partners:**

**Third party**. Third parties might use information gathered by cookies and/or web beacons for the purpose of online behavioural advertising and/or multisite advertising. The types of information that is gathered by third party cookies and/or web beacons as well as the purpose(s) for which this information is used, are set out in the privacy policy of said third parties which CrazyGames encourages you to review. CrazyGames declines all and any liability for any third-party cookies or web beacons deployed by third parties for whatever purpose.

**Google Analytics**. In addition, the Website also uses third party cookies such as cookies from Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a free service by Google to collect statistics of websites and to represent them in detail. The website administrator thus has a clear view on visitor flows, traffic flows and page displays. This way it is possible to adapt parts of a website or complete websites to the behaviour and interests of the visitors.

### 7\. **How to manage your Cookies?**

When you first visit our Websites, you will be prompted to accept, reject or set our cookies according to your preference via our Consent Management Platform (“**CMP**”). You can access this CMP at any time in the top right corner of our Websites (next to the "Login" button) via the "Preferences" button and you can configure your ad preferences.

In addition, at the browser level you can manage your cookies by adapting your browser settings. Modern browsers allow you to choose to block cookies or to accept only cookies from specific websites. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Platform. For more information about cookies, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way.

If you would like to learn more about behavioural advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver personalised ads, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving personalised ads from them at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive an “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future. You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads. If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.

Please remember, if you opt-out of interest-based advertising you will continue to receive ads on our free, ad-supported Platform, but not behaviorally targeted ads. Also, if you opt-out of CrazyGames’s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies.
