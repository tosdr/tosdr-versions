(the “**Site**”). This privacy policy applies to all of CrazyGames services and products. You should be aware that CrazyGames cannot be held responsible for the privacy policy of other sites and sources.

CrazyGames will act as the data controller in the framework of this Privacy Policy. By clicking “**Agree & Continue**”, you provide your consent with the specific aspects of this Privacy Policy and you affirm that you are of legal age to agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Whenever important changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you. CrazyGames respects the privacy of all users of its Site and shall ensure the personal information you provide is treated confidentially.

We are aware of the trust you place in us. We see it as our responsibility to protect your privacy. On this page, we will let you know what information we collect when you use our Site, why we collect it and how we improve your user experience. Thus, you will understand exactly how we work.

I. WHICH DATA DO WE COLLECT?
----------------------------

### 1\. Data we receive from you

#### Contact form

When you fill in the contact form provided on our Site or send us an e-mail, we will optionally process the following types of personal data on the basis of consent:

* First name
* Name
* E-mail
* Other information that you provide

#### Account registration

If you register an account with us you give explicit consent to collect a password, email address, phone number, user agent, and IP address. We do not store this data ourselves but work with Google Firebase authentication services to do so. The data is used to enable end-user authentication, and facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent strings and IP addresses to provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and authentication. We use Firebase as described in [“How Google Uses Information From Sites Or Apps That Use Our Services”](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

IP addresses are logged for a few weeks. Other authentication information is retained until you initiate deletion of the associated user, after which data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days. You can delete your account via Account Settings.

### 2\. Data we receive automatically

We can collect some personal data through the use of cookies: see Section V of this Privacy Policy.

Some other (personal) data may be collected without the use of cookies. Said data can only be read and used during your visit to our Site:

2. Your browser type and revision;
3. The last visited internet page;
4. (mobile) device ID’s;
5. cookie data;
6. user level data (i.e. whether a user viewed or clicked on an advertisement);

### 3\. Data we receive from third parties

When we receive Personal Information from third parties we will inform you personally.

II. WHY DO WE COLLECT THESE DATA? BASED ON WHICH LEGAL GROUND?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Your personal data will be used to enable us to optimise the services we render and the content we provide on the Site. In certain cases when we are under a legal requirement to process personal data, like age limits, we will process these personal data.

We may also use your personal data for direct marketing purposes, such as updates on new or existing games and newsletters.

We may opt to use your personal data for statistical purposes and to improve our services and product. These processing activities are thus based on a justified legitimate interest of CrazyGames.

We do not carry out any automated individual decision-making, including profiling, within the meaning of article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) which would require your explicit consent.

Advertisers on our website might use information gathered by the use cookies and/or web beacons for the purpose of online behavioral advertising and/or multisite advertising. Further information as regards the use of cookies and web beacons is set out in Section V below.

Additionally, we may share information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our identity partners/service providers. These partners return an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. To opt out of this use, please click [here](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN).

CrazyGames is not responsible for any personal data collected via any third party software or methods present on the Site and to which said third parties’ general terms and conditions may apply.

You are advised not to use your real name or share any other personal information in any of the games provided on our Site including, without limitation, when engaging in multi-player.

We have the right to share your data with all Google CPS Vendors so that Google DV360 may return GDPR compliant bids for ad delivery.

III. DATA RETENTION PERIODS
---------------------------

Your personal data will only be processed for as long as this is necessary for the purposes mentioned above. Unless there is a justified reason to retain the personal data, for example within the framework of customer relation management, your personal data will be deleted one month after you failed to visit our site during a consecutive period of \[2\] years.

IV. YOUR RIGHTS
---------------

You can get access to your personal data and rectify or erase them, free of charge. You also have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data.

If you do not wish to receive newsletters or information about our products or services, you can at any moment and without any need for justification, object to the processing of your personal data for these purposes (“unsubscribe”). You can do this by sending us an e-mail or by contacting as at the address mentioned below. You can also do this by clicking on the unsubscribe link in our advertising e-mails.

Moreover, you have the right to data portability for the personal data you have provided to CrazyGames if any and to the extent that CrazyGames has retained your personal data. If you want more information on your rights, you can always contact us or take a look at the website of the Belgian Data Protection Authority:

[https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/](https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/).

To exercise these rights, we ask you to send a clear request, to the address mentioned below, that states clearly what it is you want to know, rectify or erase. This request needs to be signed and dated and contain a copy of the front side of your identity card.

You should specifically motivate your request if you want to rectify or erase personal data or restrict the processing thereof. Once these conditions are fulfilled, CrazyGames will execute your request as soon as possible and send you a message on this matter.

V. COOKIES
----------

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small files that are saved on your computer when you visit web pages. They contain information linked to a web browser and the specific website. They are saved in a specific folder on your hard drive. If you return to a specific website, this page can recognize the visitor by means of the cookie and further elaborate the history. A web beacon is an (often transparent) graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel, that is placed on a website and that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website.

Cookies are used to increase visitor-friendliness: by identifying visitors with a cookie, they do not always have to enter the same data such as login information or screen settings every time you visit the website.

### Which kind of cookies exist?

Often a distinction is made between two large groups of cookies:

**First party cookies**: these cookies are created by a website to have the web page function better. They regulate the technical part of a site, such as language choice or remembering the products in the shopping basket in an online store. The visited website creates and places first party cookies.

**Third party cookies**: these cookies are created and placed on your computer by another (third) party than the website you visit. They remember the behavior of a surfer. Examples are social media such as Facebook or Twitter, but Google Analytics as well. This is the system used most to measure website visits.

Cookies required for the correct functioning of the Site do not require permission. All other cookies do.

### Which cookies do we use?

We will only use first party cookies to help improve your user experience on the Site. We would do this by recording specific information about the user such as the language chosen, the pages visited and the duration of the visits.

We may offer games from third-party game distributors on our portal. By playing a third-party game, your Personal Data may be processed by the third-party game distributor (directly or through the use of cookies or similar technology). Please note that if you choose to play a third-party game, you are playing that game in the environment of that game's third-party developer, over which we have no control. We, therefore, recommend that you read the privacy statement of that game distributor before playing the game.

* Game Distribution: [Privacy Policy](https://azerion.com/business/privacy.html)
* Famobi: [Privacy Policy](https://famobi.com/privacy-policy/?locale=en)
* Gamepix: [Privacy Policy](https://company.gamepix.com/privacy-policy/)
* Gamerina: [Privacy Policy](https://prinxy.app/tos/privacy/)
* Coolgames: [Privacy Policy](https://www.coolgames.com/privacy-policy)
* FRVR: [Privacy Policy](https://frvr.com/legal#PrivacyPolicy)

**Via our Consent Management Platform (CMP), which you can access at the right top corner of this page via the Show Preferences button, you can configure your cookie preferences.**

Third parties might use information gathered by cookies and/or web beacons for the purpose of online behavioral advertising and/or multisite advertising. The types of information that is gathered by third party cookies and/or web beacons as well as the purpose(s) for which this information is used, are set out in the privacy policy of said third parties which CrazyGames encourages you to review. CrazyGames declines all and any liability for any third party cookies or web beacons deployed by third parties for whatever purpose.

The Site may therefore use third party cookies such as cookies from:

In addition, the Site also uses third party cookies such as cookies from Google Analytics.

Google Analytics is a free service by Google to collect statistics of websites and to represent them in detail. The website administrator thus has a clear view on visitor flows, traffic flows and page displays. This way it is possible to adapt parts of a website or complete websites to the behavior and interests of the visitors.

### How to manage cookies?

You can do so by adapting your browser settings. Modern browsers allow you to choose to block cookies or to accept only cookies from specific websites. Contact us if you need any help in doing so.

### ID Providers

We work with the following ID providers:

* [Unified ID](https://www.thetradedesk.com/industry-initiatives/unified-id-solution) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetradedesk.com/general/privacy)
* [ID5](https://www.id5.io/) - [Privacy Policy](https://www.id5.io/privacy-policy)

VI. SECURITY MEASURES
---------------------

CrazyGames has taken all reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that your Personal Information is processed securely.

If you have any questions on these security measures, feel free to contact us at the address mentioned below.

Within CrazyGames, personal data is only available to people who need to have access to it in relation to their job.

If we do this, we will always ensure that your information is handled confidentially and in a safe manner. We also always draw up a contract with these processors. This way the processor will never be allowed to use your data on its own initiative and your data has to be erased as soon as the processor has finished the assignment.
