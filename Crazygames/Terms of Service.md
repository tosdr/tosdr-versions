CrazyGames provides a web-based gaming platform ("**Platform**"). A User is a person who visits the Website and/or the Platform, plays web games, registers via any form available on the Website and/or the Platform, creates a login, subscribes or enters into a contract with CrazyGames.

Notice will be sent to [\[email protected\]](https://www.crazygames.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). You may also contact us by writing to Ketelmakerij 20, 3010 Kessel-Lo, Belgium.

### 16\. **Applicable Law and Competent Court**

**Summary: As a Belgium-based company, the law that governs these terms and conditions and our relationship with you is Belgian law. Any disputes need to be resolved by the competent courts of Leuven (Belgium).**

These Terms will be construed in accordance with Belgian law, without prejudice to any other imperative provision of law more favorable to you applicable in your country of habitual residence.

The competent courts of Leuven will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute or controversy arising from or related to these Terms or its subject matter. If you are a resident of an EU Member State or a country or state where this clause is prohibited by local law, this clause does not apply to you and does not deprive you of the protection of the mandatory provisions of consumer protection laws in your country. CrazyGames nonetheless reserves the right to take legal proceedings in a country other than Belgium, to protect its interests or to enforce its rights where it deems it appropriate to do so.

To the extent permitted by law, the Parties agree that all claims and disputes made against the other in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, class arbitration, or representative proceeding.

### 17\. **Miscellaneous**

If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be deemed amended to comply with applicable law and the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by law.

These Terms and our Privacy Policy represent the entire understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications with respect to the subject matter.

Your use of the Website/Platform does not create an employment, partnership, joint venture or any other relationship beyond that of a website user governed by these Terms. CrazyGames cannot be held responsible in case of default (temporary or otherwise) or in case of failure to perform any of its obligations as a result of a case of force majeure or coincidence.

These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by CrazyGames without restriction.

CrazyGames' waiver of any term in these Terms does not imply an ongoing or additional waiver of that term or any other term, and CrazyGames' failure to enforce a right or provision does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
