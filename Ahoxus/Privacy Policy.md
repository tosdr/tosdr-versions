the “right to be forgotten” (RTBF), or “right to delisting” applies for individuals. you can ask for your right that information about you be not visible when associated with your exact name, **unless this information has a particular interest for the public**. this is in accordance with [the european court of justice (ECJ) 2014 decision](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62012CJ0131&from=enhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62012CJ0131&from=en).

as a principle, we remove any data we may have about you that is inaccurate, obsolete, sensitive or that do you harm anyway. except when there are “particular reasons substantiating a preponderant interest of the public in having, in the context of such data point, access to that information“. it can be the case for instance if you play an important role in public life and that this information can enlight your action or important public discussions.

your right to privacy and the right of the public to have access to information are two equally important fundamental rights when assessing the right to be forgotten.
