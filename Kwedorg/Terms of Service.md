**Can I use the music found on this site for <project-X> ?**

Legally speaking video game music remixing is rather a grey area. However, the C64 remixing community is a very friendly one, and the general feeling is that as long as you're not using the tunes in a commercial fashion, or failing to respect the wishes of the artists you won't get in trouble.

That being said, the tunes are still copyrighted, often by the composer/performer or their publisher so if you want to do right (and you should) please check with the remixer/arranger and composer for each track before you use it. You can click the names in the 'arranger' column on Remix.Kwed.Org to get in touch with the performing artists by e-mail.

Composer copyright for the original chiptunes is a bit harder to navigate. However, Chris Abbott over at C64Audio.com administers the intellectual properties for a lot of the 'big name' C64 SID composers as well as a few others, so to make sure you're covering all bases, please check with him as well (he can often informally advise about other copyrights too).
