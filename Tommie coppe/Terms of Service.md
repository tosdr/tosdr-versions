2. [Terms of Use](https://www.tommiecopper.com/terms-of-use/)

**TERMS OF USE**
================

Last Updated: July 1, 2023

**Terms and Conditions of Use** This is a legal agreement (the "Agreement" or “Terms” or “Terms of Use”) between you, the individual, company or organization ("you," "your", or "Customer") and Tommie Copper, Inc. ("we," “us” or "our"). By ordering, accessing, using, or purchasing any of our products (collectively the "Products") or services through this website (the "Website") or otherwise in any transaction with us, you are agreeing to be bound by, and are becoming a party to, this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use this Website or order Products or utilize any of our services. Your use of this Website means that you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. We may at our sole and absolute discretion change, add, modify, or delete portions of this Agreement at any time without notice. It is your sole responsibility to review this Agreement for changes prior to use of the Website, purchase of the Products or use of our services.

**General**  
   
These terms and conditions apply to ALL transactions made on or through this Website. This Agreement is intended to be governed by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. You manifest your agreement to the terms and conditions in this document by any act demonstrating your assent thereto, including clicking any button containing the words "I agree" or similar syntax, or by merely accessing the Website, whether you have read these terms or not. It is suggested that you print this form for your personal records.  
   
Our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference and further describes the collection and use of your information on the Website, including terms and conditions with respect to user reviews and testimonials, is available at [https://www.tommiecopper.com/privacy-policy](https://www.tommiecopper.com/privacy-policy/ "Privacy Policy").

 **Order Processing**  
   
Orders placed by 12:00 pm eastern time between Monday and Friday for Standard service (DHL Expedited) will be processed and shipped the same business day. Orders placed after 12:00 pm eastern standard time for this level of service will not ship until the next business day. Orders placed by 1:00 pm eastern standard time for Express service (2-3 Day) will be processed and shipped the same business day. Orders placed after 1:00 pm eastern standard time for this level of service will not ship until the next business day. **These processing times do not apply during our higher volume peak season which runs from November through January**.  
Tommie Copper does not process or ship orders on weekends, holidays, or during severe weather conditions. Any order placed during such time will be processed and shipped the next business day that shipping is feasible. Additionally, once an order has been submitted, adjustments and cancellations cannot be made.      
   
**Shipping**  
   
Tommie Copper currently ships within the United States, including United States territories and military addresses. International shipments will be delivered by the postal service of the destination country. At this time, Tommie Copper only accepts international orders from Canada. Tommie Copper uses DHL, Federal Express, United States Postal Service, or a combination of all services to ship and deliver packages. Standard service is shipped using DHL eCommerce® wherein DHL carries the package from Tommie Copper's fulfillment center to a USPS sorting facility. USPS then handles the final delivery of the package. Expedited and International services utilize only FedEx in the shipping and delivery process. Orders shipped to a PO Box must be shipped using Standard service, as expedited services cannot deliver to PO Boxes. Depending on the shipping service and location, domestic shipments can take up to 10 business days for delivery. Depending on the location, international shipments can take up to 15 days for delivery. Tommie Copper does not guarantee arrival dates or times. Tommie Copper is not responsible for shipments for any reason once they have been picked up by the carrier. Tommie Copper does not refund, credit, or upgrade shipping for any reason.

**Returns**

Tommie Copper proudly guarantees the quality, performance and fit of our products. If you are not completely satisfied with your Tommie Copper purchase or gift, simply return the item within 60 days of purchase for a refund. Please note that it can take up to ten (10) days from receipt by Tommie Copper of your returned item for your refund to be credited. Most Tommie Copper Products come with a 60-day money back guarantee, which begins the day your order ships. The following Products are Final Sale and cannot be returned or refunded: Community Wear Masks, Face Mask Gaiters, Weighted Blankets, Pillows, and Undershorts.

Any misuse or abuse of the 60-Day Money Back Guarantee or other conditions of sale, as determined by Tommie Copper in its sole discretion, shall negate, and render a purchaser ineligible for, among other benefits, the 60-Day Money Back Guarantee.   In the event that Tommie Copper deems a purchaser ineligible for the 60-Day Money Back Guarantee and/or any such other benefits, Tommie Copper may, in addition to its other rights and remedies:  (i) decline claims for refunds, returns and exchanges;  and (ii) reject all future orders.

**Billing Errors**  
   
If you believe that you have been billed in error, please notify our Customer Service Department immediately. If we do not hear from you within thirty (30) days after such billing error first appears on any account statement, the billing will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes, including resolution of inquiries made by your credit card issuer. You are deemed to have released us from all liabilities and claims of loss resulting from any error or discrepancy that is not reported to us within thirty (30) days of its appearance on your credit card account statement.

**Assignment.** This Agreement and the rights and liabilities of the parties hereto inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns. We may assign this Agreement to any successor entity. Customer may not assign without our written permission.  
**Severability**. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator finds any provision of this Agreement, or any portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions will continue in full force and effect.  
**Attorneys’ Fees**. In the event any Party shall commence any claims, actions, formal legal action, or arbitration to interpret and/or enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or relating in any way to this Agreement, including without limitation asserted breaches of representations and warranties, the prevailing party in any such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover, in addition to all other available relief, its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in connection therewith, including attorneys’ fees incurred on appeal.

**Disputes and Governing Law**

Use of this Website and these Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York of the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In the event that any portion of these Terms of Use are deemed unenforceable, unlawful or void by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, in any jurisdiction for any reason, unless narrowed by construction, such portion of these Terms of Use shall, for purposes of such jurisdiction only, be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable portion had been more narrowly constructed so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable (or if such provision cannot be drawn narrowly enough, the tribunal making any such determination shall have the power to modify such portion of these Terms of Use to the extent necessary to make such portion of these Terms of Use enforceable in such jurisdiction, and such portion shall then be applicable in such modified form in such jurisdiction). If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such portion of these Terms of Use would be held to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction for any reason, such portion, as to such jurisdiction only, shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, prohibition or unenforceability, without invalidating the remaining provisions set forth in these Terms of Use. No narrowed construction, modification, or invalidation of any portion of the Terms of Use shall affect the construction, validity, or enforceability of such portion in any other jurisdiction. No waiver by Tommie Copper of any term or condition of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or of any other term or condition, and Tommie Copper’s failure to assert any right or demand compliance with any provision of these Terms of Use shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.

Except where prohibited by law, as a condition of you clicking acceptance of these Terms of Use and/or accessing and/or using this Website, you agree that (1) any and all disputes and causes of action arising out of or connected with this Website, including but not limited to purchases or attempted purchases of Products, shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, and exclusively by final and binding arbitration in New York within one year from the date that the cause of action arose (or, if multiple cause of actions are involved, from the date that the first cause of action arose), with such arbitration conducted pursuant to the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association; and (2) judgment upon such arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Unless prohibited by law, no arbitration brought pursuant hereto shall be joined to any other action or arbitration.

The rules governing arbitration are different than those in court. Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages as a court. Except as may otherwise be provided in AAA’s Consumer Due Process Protocol that allows consumers to file certain claims in small claims court, you understand that by accepting these Terms and Conditions, you are giving up your right to a trial in court, either with or without a jury.

Unless prohibited by law, under no circumstances will you be permitted to obtain an award for, and by accessing and/or using the Website you waive all rights to claim, punitive, incidental, consequential or any other indirect damages (including multiplied and/or increased damages and/or attorneys' fees and court costs) for, any dispute or cause of action that you may have that relates in whole or part to this Website, and/or its content.

By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you have agreed to waive your right to recover any damages relating to your use of the Website. If such waiver is deemed unenforceable, you, nonetheless, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Terms of Use or otherwise, you agree that your recovery with respect to any and all claims, judgments, and awards for which you are entitled shall, unless prohibited by law, be limited to your actual out-of-pocket costs incurred, excluding attorneys’ fees and court costs.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Terms of Use, Tommie Copper may at any time seek injunctive or other appropriate relief against you and/or against others, in any state or federal court in the state of New York and/or in any other court chosen by Tommie Copper, in the event that Tommie Copper believes that there is a violation, or a threatened violation, that has jurisdiction of any of Tommie Copper’s intellectual property rights and, in such case, you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such court.
