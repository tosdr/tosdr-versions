### * COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

Cookies are small files that we or others send to and store on or with your computer so that your computer, browser, mobile app or other application can be recognized as unique the next time you access, visit, use or otherwise take advantage of the Services or other media. Cookies may also reflect demographic data pertaining to you or other data linked to information you submit. One use or consequence of cookies is to enable you to receive customized ads, alerts, content, services or information. You are always free to decline any cookies we use by adjusting the settings of your browser, as your browser may permit; however, some products, services or features might not be available or operate properly if cookies are not enabled. Some of our advertisers and third-party service providers may also utilize their own cookies.

In addition, we, our service providers and others sometimes use data-gathering mechanisms on the Services, including without limitation “web beacons”, “clear GIFs”, “pixels” and/or “tags”. These perform statistical and administrative functions, such as measuring site and page traffic, verifying advertising paths, better understanding user interests and activity, gathering related information (such as information relating to a particular browser, device or IP address) and positioning images, and typically do so without detracting from your online experience. Such mechanisms are not necessarily designed to collect Personal Information. In addition, if you have provided your email address, we might use a non-human unreadable form (or “hash”) of your email address to deliver, or facilitate delivery of, relevant advertisements and information to you on or by way of the Services or on or by way of other websites or media, including, for example, popular social media sites and features.

### * HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN

We, or service providers acting on our behalf, may use the information collected from and about you to:

* Provide our products and services, including authorizing a purchase, or completing a transaction that you requested;
* Create and manage online accounts;
* Send promotional materials, alerts regarding available offers and other communications, including text/SMS messages if you provided your mobile number and opted in to receive such messages (for information on our text messaging program, please see our Text/SMS Messaging Program Terms);
* Communicate about, and administer participation in, special events, promotions, programs, offers, surveys, contests and market research;
* Respond to inquiries from you and other third-parties, including inquiries from law enforcement agencies;
* Anonymize or de-identify personal information to provide third parties with aggregated data reports showing anonymized information and other non-personal information;
* Provide technical support;
* Generate suggestions about the type of content you may enjoy;
* Supplement your personal information collected directly from you and/or from automated means with additional information from publicly and commercially available sources, and/or information from Move affiliates and our business partners;

* Protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, claims and other liabilities;
* Comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, contractual obligations and our terms of service and other policies; and
* In other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.

### INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING

As described in this Privacy Notice, we, as well as our third-party service providers, may obtain information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. We and our third-party service providers also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites and apps. We also use third parties (including third-party ad servers) to serve ads on our Services. We engage third-party advertising networks to help us target our messaging to visitors through interest-based and contextual means.

Through these ad networks, we can track your online activities (such as your visits to websites and your use of apps that serve our advertisements, including the pages or ads your view and actions you take on those sites or apps) over time and across third-party websites and apps by obtaining information through automated means, as described above. This data collection takes place both on our sites, apps and emails and on third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad networks. Our third-party advertisers and/or ad networks may also gather data relating to you in connection with your interactions with the advertisements they place on our Services. The networks use this information to show you advertisements on our Services or other third-party websites and apps that may be tailored to your individual interests. This information also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

The activities described in this section may be considered “sharing” data under the laws of certain states. Subject to certain limitations, some U.S. residents have the right to opt out of having their personal information shared for this purpose. The section below entitled [Your Choices and Rights](#your-choices-and-rights) provides details on and explains how to exercise your choices regarding interest-based advertising.

### * INFORMATION WE SHARE

* **Our Subsidiaries and Affiliated Businesses.** Our subsidiaries and affiliated businesses within the Move family of companies and the News Corp family of companies may use your personal information consistent with this Privacy Notice.

We also share certain data such as your clickstream data, browsing and content viewing history, with our affiliate NC Audience Exchange LLC, ("NewsIQ"), which collects information from you through automated means, as described above, when you are using the Services. To learn more about News IQ and if you wish to opt out of having your data shared with NC Audience Exchange, please click [here.](http://ncaudienceexchange.com/privacy/)
  
* **With our Service Providers.** With third parties who perform services on our behalf.
  
* **With our Clients or Business Partners.** With our third-party clients or business partners, such as realtors, landlords, and other Professionals to facilitate your transactions, and other third parties for their own commercial or marketing purposes, such as to serve targeted advertisements.
  
* **For Legal Requirements and Proceedings.** We may disclose information to law enforcement authorities or other government officials if we are required to do so to comply with subpoenas, court orders, legal process or other law enforcement or other government measures, and to comply with other legal obligations. We may also disclose information if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.
  
* **To Protect our Services and Users.** We may disclose information to protect and defend the rights, interests and safety of the Services, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and their employees, contractors and agents; to protect the security and safety of our users of the Services, including when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss.
  
* **For Business Transfers.** In the event of a proposed or completed sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).
  
* **With Your Consent.** We may share your information with select third-party partners with your consent or at your direction so they can send you promotions, ads or offers about their services or products that you may be interested in. We also may give you the option to receive communications from one of our advertising partners, such as when we offer a joint promotion with that third-party advertiser. If you choose to opt in to receiving communications from that third-party advertiser by providing your explicit consent, the third-party advertiser will manage your personal information pursuant to their own privacy policy.
  
* **Non-personal Information.** When the information collected from or about you is not defined as personal information under applicable law, we may share such non-personal, de-identified information or aggregated information with third parties at our discretion.
  
* **Our business partners:**
    * National Association of REALTORS® (“NAR”). We may share information about you with the NAR and its affiliates in connection with business, advocacy and real estate related matters of interest to Move, the NAR or both, who may use such information to contact you or otherwise with respect to such matters
    * Adobe: We participate in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op to better understand how you use our websites and apps across the various devices you use (such as a laptop or desktop computer, tablet, phone or smart watch) and to deliver tailored promotions. To learn more about how this is done and manage certain choices you have, please [click here](https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com/)
    * FullStory: We use the FullStory technology service to help us better understand how users experience our Services (e.g. how much time users spend on specific pages or which links they choose to click) and incorporate that feedback into our Services. FullStory collects data on our users’ mouse clicks and movement on our Services to generate virtual “recordings” of users’ behavior on our Services. All collected information is stored in a pseudonymized user profile. Neither FullStory nor we will use this information to identify individual users or to match it with further data on an individual user. For further details, please see FullStory’s privacy policy by [clicking here](https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy-policy); you can opt out of the creation of a user profile, FullStory’s storing of data about your usage of our Services and FullStory’s use of tracking cookies on other websites by following [this opt-out link](https://www.fullstory.com/optout/).
* For information, features, products and services marketed or offered to you jointly or on a coordinated basis by us and a third party, we may share information about you with, or information may be gathered independently by, the third party. In these situations, we will be free to use such information to facilitate such features, products and services (or information about them) being made available to you and as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Notice, and you understand the third party may use the information in different ways. Although not always the case, you often can tell when information, features, products or services are marketed or offered jointly or in coordination with a third party because a portion of the Services often will be “co-branded” in such cases, will display the third party’s logo and/or name (whether or not along with our own), will describe or reference the relationship between us and the third party or will be set up so that you can contact or be linked to the third party or its website to initiate, complete or learn more about the transaction. Please be aware that each company we do business with (including Professionals) has its own policies regarding its use, sharing and protection of information about you and that such policies may differ from those outlined in this Privacy Notice.

You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).

Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services to you and for compliance with applicable law. If you ask us to delete certain information, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.

California customers may request, once per year, that we disclose the identity of any third parties with whom we have shared personal information for the third-parties’ direct marketing purposes within the previous calendar year, along with the type of personal information disclosed.

You also have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. California law broadly defines sale or sharing such that it may include allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies, IP address and/or browsing behavior, to deliver targeted advertising.
