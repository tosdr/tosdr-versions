Service Level Agreement

Reliable and Always Online

**Service Level Agreement:**
----------------------------

  

This document shows you the high quality of service we are promising. RackNerd has spent considerable time to make available one of the most redundant networks available anywhere. This has been accomplished by the following:

  

**\- Redundant routers and switches**

**\- Multiple upstream providers**

**\- All key network components are monitored**

  

RackNerd will provide a 99.999% uninterrupted transit to the Internet (as measured on a monthly basis) as well as 99.999% uninterrupted electricity. Should transit to the Internet or electricity become unavailable for a cumulative period up to 1 hour beyond the 99.999% minimum in any month of service, the client will receive an account credit equivalent to 2% of the client’s Recurring Monthly Fees of affected services for that month for every additional 1 hour the network or power is unavailable, unless otherwise stated below it will not to exceed 50% of the client’s Recurring Monthly Fees.

  

Unless otherwise stated below, all credit calculations will be based on unavailability in 1 hour increments. The above agreement does not cover outages caused by equipment and/or events under the control of the client. This Service Level Agreement does not cover outages due to scheduled or emergency network and/or facility maintenance, which will be broadcast to all customers in advance via the web page here, and will not exceed 180 minutes per month.

  

Unless otherwise stated below, any and all credits to the client will not exceed 50% of the client’s Recurring Monthly Fees for the month in which the credit is issued. Unless otherwise stated below, all credits must be requested within 30 days of the incident.

  

To request a credit via email [\[email protected\]](https://racknerd.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with your account name along with the time of and time span of the outage. Accounts must not be past due when requesting an SLA credit.
