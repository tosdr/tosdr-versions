We loved the opportunity to apply our business knowledge in a real world context. By analyzing our results from previous rounds, we have learned to maximize our profits as well as how to take care of customer and employee satisfaction. It was great how realistic the simulation was and how many variables were taken into account.

The game itself is very well developed keeping in mind the work-from-home nature that pre-exists in current times. While some can pass it off as just a game, the insight attained from it is invaluable, especially when money is a constraint as it very much is in the real world and failure is not an option. Everything in the simulation is in the right place and the progression of the levels make logical sense even in a virtual scenario. We highly appreciated the fact that the game catered to ALL the scenarios that concern a business; financial, strategy, marketing, human resources and even supply chain to a limited extent.

I thought the „Electronic Store“ simulation would be great to implement during the processes of onboarding and training of new entry level employees who haven’t had any experience in the given field. It was great helping everyone with their decisions and how invested they all became in the game. Some players stuck to one strategy that proved to be successful, while others decided to experiment. Given the fact everyone was competing against each other in the same market, the players had to study their competition’s strategies and try to think one that would help their business grow. Every round was different and exciting. I would definitely recommend this simulation, or any other simulation by Revas, for education or training of employees. It has been a great pleasure to work with the Revas team and I hope we will work together again in the near future.

I think Revas Business Simulation Games gives a fantastic opportunity for youngsters to apply all the concepts that they are learning or have learnt in their classrooms. We as teachers talk about real life situations and try to give students a feel through case studies. This, however, is way beyond any of that! My students’ understanding of the concepts has improved so much. Thank you Revas!

The Revas software flexible solutions, possible combinations and a well-chosen method of analyzing the output data, for which the game participant is responsible, indicate that this tool should be more widely used not only in secondary education, but above all in universities, where each participant, even tangibly will be able to observe what are the effects of business operations of virtual companies.  
I have seen many similar solutions, but the quality of REVAS software should be a specific reference as a great example of product accuracy.

Unsere Website nutzt so genannte Cookies, welche dazu dienen, unsere Internetpräsenz insgesamt nutzerfreundlicher, effektiver sowie sicherer zu machen – etwa wenn es darum geht, das Navigieren auf unserer Plattform zu beschleunigen. Zudem versetzen uns Cookies in die Lage, etwa die Häufigkeit von Seitenaufrufen und die allgemeine Navigation zu messen.

Bei Cookies handelt es sich um kleine Textdateien, die auf Ihrem Computersystem abgelegt werden. Cookies richten auf Ihrem Rechner keinen Schaden an und enthalten keine Viren.

Im Auftrag des Betreibers dieser Website wird Google diese Informationen benutzen, um Ihre Nutzung der Website auszuwerten, um Reports über die Websiteaktivitäten zusammenzustellen und um weitere mit der Websitenutzung und der Internetnutzung verbundene Dienstleistungen gegenüber dem Websitebetreiber zu erbringen. Die im Rahmen von Google Analytics von Ihrem Browser übermittelte IP-Adresse wird nicht mit anderen Daten von Google zusammengeführt.

**Einsatz von Google-Maps**

Diese Website nutzt die Komponente “Google Maps” zur Darstellung von Lageplänen, betrieben von der Firma Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, nachfolgend „Google“.

Bei jedem Aufruf der Komponente “Google Maps” wird von Google ein Cookie gesetzt, um bei der Anzeige der Seite, auf der die Komponente “Google Maps” integriert ist, Nutzereinstellungen und -daten zu verarbeiten.

Jedoch greift der Google Tag Manager nicht auf diese Daten zu. Wurde auf Domain- oder Cookie-Ebene eine Deaktivierung vorgenommen, so bleibt sie für alle Tracking-Tags bestehen, insofern diese mit dem Google Tag Manager implementiert werden.

**Providing, improving and developing our services.**  
The availability of this information allows us to maintain the Services, personalize the content and suggest different solutions to users, because it is thanks to the information collected that we understand how users use elements of the Services and resources that are of interest to them.

We provide and support our Services using cookies and other similar technologies, applying them in each of the areas described here using information about users.

**Policy for cookies and other similar technologies**

In connection with providing the content of websites, we use so-called cookies, i.e. information saved by servers on the user’s terminal device, which servers can read every time they connect to this terminal device. We may also use other technologies with functions similar or identical to cookies. In this document, information about cookies also applies to other similar technologies used within our websites. Cookie files (or ‘cookies’) consist of IT data, in particular text files, which are stored in the user’s terminal device connected to websites. Cookies usually contain the domain name of the website they come from, the time they were stored on the terminal device and a unique number.  
Cookies are used to:  
1) adapt the content of websites to user preferences and optimize the use of websites; in particular, these files allows the recognition of the user of the website’s device and proper display of the website, tailored to his individual needs,  
2) create statistics that help to understand how the website users use the websites, which allows improvements in their structure and content,  
3) maintaining the user session of the website (after logging in), thanks to which the user does not have to re-enter their login and password on each subpage of the website,  
4) providing users with advertising content more tailored to their interests.  
As part of our websites, we may use the following types of cookies:  
1) “essential” cookies, enabling the use of services available as part of the website, e.g. authentication cookies used for services that require authentication on the site,  
2) cookies used to ensure security, e.g. used to detect fraud in the field of authentication within the website,  
3) cookies enabling the collection of information on the use of website pages,  
4) “functional” cookies that enable “remembering” the settings selected by the user and personalization of the user interface, e.g. in the scope of the selected language or region of the user’s origin, font size, website appearance, etc.,  
5) “advertising” cookies, enabling provision to the users of advertising content more tailored to their interests.  
In many cases, software used for browsing websites (web browser) allows cookies to be stored in the user’s terminal device by default. Website users can change cookie settings at any time. These settings can be changed, in particular in such a way as to block the automatic handling of cookies in the settings of the web browser or to inform the user of the website about each placing in their device. Detailed information about the possibilities and ways of using cookies is available in the software (web browser) settings. Failure to change the cookie settings means that they will be placed in the user’s terminal device, and thus we will store information on the user’s terminal device and access this information.  
Disabling the use of cookies may make it difficult to use certain services on our websites, in particular those requiring login. Disabling the option of accepting cookies does not make it impossible to read or watch content posted on websites, apart from those to which access requires login.

**Summonses and court orders and damages prevention**  
We reserve the right to access the user’s information, store and share it in the case of summonses and court orders, if we believe in good faith that we are obliged to do so by law. This may also apply to summonses and orders from jurisdictions from outside Poland, for which we believe in good faith that this is required by the law of the jurisdiction, applies to users in a given jurisdiction and is compliant with international standards. We also reserve the right to obtain, store and transmit information in the case of a good faith belief that this is necessary to detect frauds and other illegal activities, prevent such actions or minimise their effects, to protect us, the User and others, including in investigations, as well as to prevent risks to human life or health. We may, for example, provide other entities with information about the credibility of the user’s account, with a view to preventing fraud and abuse, both inside and outside our website. The information we collect may be displayed, processed and retained for a long period if it is subject to a court order or subpoena, investigation by law enforcement or investigation of violations of our terms or policies, or if its storage may otherwise prevent damage. We also reserve the right to store information about accounts blocked as a result of violation of our regulations for at least a year to prevent further violations and other breaches of our regulations.

The privacy policy can be changed. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of information and will always be available at the Internet address [https://www.revas.online/en/privacy-policy/](https://www.revas.online/en/privacy-policy/).
