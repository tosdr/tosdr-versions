If you submit an inquiry to us regarding a job application, we will handle it in accordance with our [Candidate Privacy Policy](https://www.verkada.com/privacy/candidate-privacy-policy).

    We work with social media platforms and search engines, such as LinkedIn, Meta, Reddit and Google, to deliver targeted ads on their platforms.  We do this by: (1) matching our customers and prospects to those who are also users of these platforms; and (2) identifying individuals on these platforms who share common characteristics with our customers and prospects to create targeted audiences for our ads. These audiences may include current customers, prospects, Site visitors and Product users. 
    
    You can review and update how social media platforms use and share your data for these purposes. Please visit your social media platform privacy settings for more information.
    
    Command also uses third-party technologies, such as cookies, to measure the performance of our Apps and the Command website to help us develop and improve them. Metrics collected by these technologies are not used for advertising purposes.

    * law enforcement, regulators, government agencies, courts or other third parties in response to legal process or where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person

    _Legal Basis for processing Personal Information_
    
    Our legal basis for processing the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We may rely on the following legal bases for processing:
    
    We process Personal Information from you based on consent where appropriate, for example, depending on where you are located, prior to using cookies (see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.verkada.com/privacy/cookie-policy)). If we rely on your consent to process your Personal Information, we will ask for this before processing. 
    
    Where we are subject to a contract with you, we process your Personal Information on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of the contract or pre-contractual steps. If you do not provide the Personal Information required, we may not be able to perform the contract.
    
    We also process Personal Information on the basis of our legitimate interests. For example, to understand how you engage with us, deliver our Site and Products to you, troubleshoot, secure, develop and improve our Products or Site, determine your location to deliver the Site in certain languages and any region- specific content provide you with information you have requested from us or to respond to your requests such as signing up to an event or to receive content online (e.g., webinar, whitepaper, product demo) and to create and provide you access to your Command account. We may also process your Personal Information in relation to a contract with us, for example, when we notify you about changes to our services, fulfilling orders, sending invoices, and processing renewals. Where we rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis for processing your Personal Information, we have also considered your rights and interests at the same time, and concluded that our interests are not overridden by your rights.
    
    In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process your Personal Information.
    
    _Data Transfer_
    
    Verkada has implemented safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection where your Personal Information is transferred outside of the EEA or UK, such as data processing agreements with our third party vendors and partners through which we implement the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of Personal Information as approved by the European Commission or other permitted mechanisms. Further details can be provided upon request.
    
    _Your Rights_
    
    You have the following data protection rights (depending on the context in which we process your information):
    
    * **Access:** You have the right to ask us for copies of your Personal Information. There are some exemptions, which means you may not always receive all the information we process. If you use Command, you can access your Personal Information through your Command account. 
        
    * **Erasure:** You have the right to ask us to erase your Personal Information in certain circumstances. You can access, amend, or delete your information, including Personal Information, through your Command account. Please contact Verkada Support at [\[email protected\]](https://www.verkada.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you have questions regarding how to delete your account or information associated with it.
        
    * **Rectification:** You have the right to ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate and to complete information you think is incomplete. If you use Command, you can amend your Personal Information held on Command through your Command account.
        
    * **Object / Restrict Processing / Request Portability:** In certain circumstances, you can object to processing of your Personal Information, ask us to restrict processing of your Personal Information or request portability of your Personal Information. 
        
    * **Opt-out of Marketing Communications:** You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time [on our website](https://www.verkada.com/emailsettings/). 
        
    * **Withdraw Your Consent**: Similarly, if we have collected and processed your Personal Information with your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
        
    
    You can request to exercise any of your privacy rights above by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.verkada.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). You also have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. For Europe please see [here](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en), for Switzerland [here](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html)  and for the UK, [here](https://ico.org.uk/).
    
* California Residents
    
    The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to disclose information regarding the categories of personal information and sensitive personal information that we have collected about California consumers, the categories of sources from which the information was collected, the business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined by applicable law) for which the information was collected, and the categories of parties to whom we disclose personal information. As used in this section, “personal information” shall have the meaning set forth in the CCPA.
    
    Throughout this Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we share it. Under the CCPA, we also have to provide you with the "categories" of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect and disclose for “business or commercial purposes” (as those terms are defined by the CCPA). 
    
    In the twelve months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we have collected and disclosed the categories of personal information described in [When do we collect Personal Information?](#whendowecollectpersonalinformation) The categories of personal information are: identifiers (such as name, address, and email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); financial data (such as credit card and other financial account information); internet or other network or device activity (such as IP address); professional or employment-related information (such as your current employer and job title); general location information (such as inferred from an IP address); inference data about you (such as if we derive information about your role within a company); audio and visual information (such as when you call into customer service or visit our offices); and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. 
    
    The categories of sensitive personal information are account log-in and password or other credentials allowing access to your account.
    
    We process the categories of personal information identified above for the purposes as described in more detail in [When do we collect Personal Information?](#whendowecollectpersonalinformation) 
    
    We collect the categories of personal information identified above from the following sources: (1) directly from you; (2) through your use of the Products; and (3) other parties (e.g., other users) and unaffiliated parties.
    
    We describe our information disclosure practices in more detail in the section above on [Disclosure of Personal Information](#disclosureofpersonalinformation).
    
    _“Sale” and “Sharing” of Personal Information_
    
    The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” or “share” personal information. Where we refer to “sell” or “share” (or their variants) in quotes, we are referring to those terms as uniquely defined in the CCPA.
    
    We may use third-party analytics services and online advertising services that may result in the “sharing” of online identifiers and other identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, general location information, usage information, email addresses) with analytics partners to help us analyze and understand use of the Site and our Products and to advertise the Products on other websites. In some cases, such practice may also constitute a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA. If you or your authorized agent would like to opt out of our “sharing” or “sale” of your information for such purposes, you may do so by clicking Your Privacy Choices on the footer of the Site. To opt-out of the “sharing” or “sale” of personal information that is not based on cookies or other tracking technologies, please contact [\[email protected\]](https://www.verkada.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  For more information, see our [Cookies Policy](https://www.verkada.com/privacy/cookie-policy). For clarity, if you’ve provided consent to receive text messages from us, we do not share that consent with unaffiliated third parties for their own use unless you have consented to that disclosure.
    
    Please note that we also respond to and abide by opt-out preference signals sent through the Global Privacy Control. Any opt-out preferences you have exercised through these methods will only apply to the specific device/browser on which you made them.  For more information on how to use the Global Privacy Control, see [www.globalprivacycontrol.org](http://www.globalprivacycontrol.org/).
    
    We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of children under 16.
    
    _Do Not Track Disclosure_
    
    We do not respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations, and solutions. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the Global Privacy Control browser choice referenced above.
    
    _Retention of Your Personal Information_
    
    Please see the [Data Retention](#dataretention) section below.
    
    _CCPA Rights_
    
    If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we:
    
    * provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, “selling,” or “sharing” your personal information; the categories of third parties to whom we disclose or “sell,” or with whom we “share,” personal information; and the categories of personal information we “sell” or “share”
        
    * provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you
        
    * delete certain information we have about you
        
    * correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you
        
    
    You may also have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any, and the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights.
    
    Some information may be exempt from these rights under applicable law. We may also need certain types of information in order to provide you with our Products or services, and if you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use them.  If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request at [\[email protected\]](https://www.verkada.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or call 833.280.5900. You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. To do so, you will need to provide the information identified in the webform or as otherwise directed by us. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You may still need to verify your identity directly with us.
    
    The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information in ways that create an opt-out right.
    
    Please see the [Candidate Privacy Policy](https://www.verkada.com/privacy/candidate-privacy-policy#californiaresidents) for information on how we handle Personal Information Collected with regard to a job application.
    
* Opt-out of Marketing Communications
    
    You  can  opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can do this by following the opt-out link or instructions contained in any such email or by visiting [our website](https://www.verkada.com/emailsettings/) and following the instructions listed there. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (e.g., postal marketing), please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.verkada.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please note that it may take a few business days for us to process opt-out requests and we will need to retain your Personal Information on a suppression list to honor your opt-out request. 
    
    If you opt-out of receiving marketing emails or promotions, we will still send you service-based emails where requested by you or to service your account and emails to facilitate a transaction.
    
* Third-party Links
    
    The Site contains links to other, third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Privacy Policy, but, instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.
    
* Where your Personal Information is stored and processed
    
    Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective) and data may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances. The Site is primarily hosted in the United States.
    
    By providing your Personal Information to Verkada, you acknowledge the transfer of your information to the United States for storage, use, processing, maintenance, and onward transfer of such information to other entities, regardless of their location. However, such activities will be done in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
    
    Third parties that we work with may also process your Personal Information in the U.S. and / or facilitate the transfer of or access to your Personal Information outside of the U.S. We will take steps to require them to process your Personal Information subject to appropriate safeguards (for example, implementing standard contractual clauses where appropriate).
    
* Data Retention
    
    We retain Personal Information we collect from you for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed, including where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested) or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements or as otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations.
    
* Children and Minors
    
    The Site and Products are not directed to individuals under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 18. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.verkada.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible as required under applicable laws.
    
* Updates to this Privacy Policy
    
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When we update our Privacy Policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you consistent with the significance of the changes we make and as required by applicable law.
