* Applicable taxes may vary. We are not able to notify you in advance of changes in applicable taxes.
* If a stated price is determined by us in our sole discretion to be in error, we are not under any obligation to offer you the subscription or product at that price.

**ADDITIONAL COSTS**

* You may choose to access additional products that are not included in your subscription price ("paid products"). If you access additional products, you will be responsible for paying any additional charges. Any additional charges will be clearly described during the order process.
* When you use your digital subscription on a mobile device or a computer, you may incur charges from your service provider, such as telecommunications fees or data fees. These fees are not included in your subscription, and you are responsible for paying them separately.
* If you believe someone else has used your account or you are being charged for a product you do not have, please contact Customer Service by e-mail at support \[at\] newsweek.com

To view your billing cycle, visit the "My Account" section of Newsweek.com.
* All Newsweek subscriptions are renewed automatically. By clicking "Subscribe" when you purchase a digital or print subscription, you authorize us to renew your subscription automatically and to charge you at the start of each new term until you cancel.
* When we renew your digital or print subscription, we will use the payment method currently associated with your account. For your convenience, we will use our most up to date credit card information to charge your account.
* You will not be notified in advance of upcoming renewals. Please see our policies on [Cancellations and Refunds](https://www.newsweek.com/terms-sale#cancel-refund) below for information about canceling.

**PROMOTIONS**

* From time to time, we may offer promotions. The specific terms of each promotion are stated at the time each promotion is offered. Each promotion may be different. Promotions cannot be combined.
* You are required to provide your payment details when you sign up for a promotion. At the end of the promotion, you will automatically be signed up for the related subscription that will begin at the end of the promotional period. We will not notify you in advance that the promotion is about to end. To cancel and avoid being charged, you must notify us five working days before the promotion ends.

**THIRD PARTIES**

* If you have purchased your subscription or a product through a third party, these Terms of Sale may not apply to you. We are not liable to you for any claims related to purchases made through third parties. Please contact the third party directly which would include application providers.

**ACCESS RESTRICTIONS**

* You are not authorized to access any digital subscriptions or other paid products unless you have opened a subscription account and paid the appropriate fee. If you purchased a subscription through Newsweek directly, as opposed to a third party, you will have received access credentials (e.g., a username and password) from us, and are using those access credentials.
* You may not assist third parties in accessing digital subscriptions or paid products on an unauthorized basis, including by sharing your access credentials or providing any content or other materials that you obtained through a digital subscription or as a paid product.
* You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access credentials and for all usage or activity on your digital subscription accounts. Such responsibility expressly includes any purchases made or other charges incurred on your credit card in connection with your use (or an authorized third party's use) of a digital subscription or paid product.
* In the event of any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity relating to your digital subscription or paid products, we may, in our sole discretion, terminate those accounts and refer you to appropriate law enforcement agencies. You may be responsible for damages from any such fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity.

**MOBILE ACCESS AND JURISDICTIONAL AVAILABILITY**

* Some components of digital subscriptions or other paid products may be accessible only using a particular kind of device – for example, an Apple iPad or an Amazon Kindle. You should investigate digital subscriptions or other paid products before you pay for access to them to ensure that they will work with your device because those third parties may not refund your order and we will not refund any fees you paid if the digital subscription or paid product you ordered is not compatible.
* Certain components of digital subscriptions or paid products may not be available for use in every jurisdiction, and we will not refund any fees you paid if the digital subscription or paid product you ordered is not available. In addition, if a mobile device or service or digital product is no longer available to you, we will not issue you a refund for any fees you paid for those services or products.
* For information on compatibility and availability, please visit the applicable provider's website or contact us at support \[at\] newsweek.com before you subscribe or order.

**2\. CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS**

**CANCELLATION AND REFUNDS OF DIGITAL, PRINT SUBSCRIPTIONS OR ONE-TIME PURCHASES**

* You can cancel your Newsweek subscription at any time by e-mailing us at support \[at\] newsweek.com. To the extent applicable, Corporate Subscription billing cycles and terms of cancellations may differ and would be governed by the terms set forth in the Corporate Subscription Purchase Order.
* We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to issue refunds or credits when you request it. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.
* We also reserve the right to suspend or terminate your subscription or product for any lawful reason, with or without notice and without further obligation. You will not be entitled to a refund in these circumstances.
* You will not receive a refund if a portion or all of our digital products are temporarily unavailable.
* If you canceled your subscription, but are still receiving bills, please note that it takes a few days for a cancellation to become effective. Therefore, if you receive any invoices after you have canceled, please ignore them. If you ordered through an agent (e.g., [EBSCO](https://www.ebscomags.com/newsweek-regular-ed?postingid=2128&utm_campaign=ebsco_1&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_content=ebsco_ad%20link&utm_term=epsco&gclid=cov32khg9l0cfahlogod9cmahg) or [New Sub Services](http://www.magazinecustomerservice.com/)), you should also check with that agent to ensure that your cancellation request was received and processed.
* One-time purchases (e.g., gift subscriptions, single issues, etc.) cannot be canceled and no refunds will be issued.

**CANCELLATION OF NEWSWEEK MONTHLY OR ANNUAL DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTIONS**

* When you cancel your digital subscription, you cancel only future charges associated with your subscription. You may notify us of your intent to cancel at any time, but the cancellation will become effective as of the billing cycle following the date of cancellation. You will not receive a refund for the current billing cycle. You will continue to have the same access and benefits of your product for the remainder of the current billing period. Please note, you must notify us at least five working days before your next billing period begins in order to cancel and avoid being charged.

**CANCELLATION OF PRINT SUBSCRIPTIONS**

* When you cancel your print subscription, we will stop your print service and issue a prorated refund for the unserved or unmailed portion of your print subscription. When you cancel your print subscription, your digital subscription will end with it.
* If your print subscription is paid monthly, your cancellation will become effective as of the billing cycle following the date of cancellation. You will not receive a refund for the current billing cycle. You will continue to have the same digital access, and to receive print copies, for the remainder of the current billing period.

**CHANGES TO CONTENT OR ACCESS**

* We reserve the right to make changes to our digital products at any time. If we temporarily reduce or eliminate the charge for content or access that you are currently paying for under different terms, you will not receive a refund.
