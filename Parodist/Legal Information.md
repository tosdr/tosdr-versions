Why it is nothing but a parody



We have the utmost respect for copyright as well as everybody’s right to one’s voice.That’s why we have thoroughly studied the issue of the use of our technology invarious products. We found that the parody is one of the ways to use it.A parody (derived from Ancient Greek παρά “near, besides, parallel to” and Ancient

Greek ᾠδή "song, ode") is an artwork which is created to imitate and/or make fun of

an original work employing deliberate reproduction of unique features of a knownwork in a modified form.This means that a person who parodies another person has his or her voice and useshis or her skills and talents. Thanks to many hours of training, a parodist changes hisor her voice into a different one and emphasizes its special features by deliberatelyexaggerating or magnifying.

When developing our synthesized voices, we used the approach which a parodistuses when creating a parody, as follows:- Our neural network was originally taught using a huge amount of data (over30 hours of recorded speech) of a single announcer who isn’t a well-knownperson. After that, our neural network was given additional training with theuse of the data of a certain celebrity (under 1 hours of speech). That meansthat our goal was just to teach the model to create parodies but we didn’tteach it using raw data of a certain celebrity (which isn’t hard indeed). Thus,like a parodist, our neural network has a certain “own voice”, which it tries tochange and make it as close to that of a certain celebrity as possible.- We deliberately picked the data from the selections of announcers’ speecheswhich could add as many comic elements to the voice as possible. Forexample, when creating a voice resembling that of Donald Trump, wedeliberately picked the data where he speaks in a raised voice, that’s why withthe synthesis complete, he often shouts even ordinary words, which makesthe most listeners laugh. We ran focus groups, and over 60% noted thathearing these fragments made a person smile.- We modified the voice and added some unnatural effects. Whenpreprocessing the data before teaching the neural network, we deliberatelyapplied various filters, for example, we raised the tone and added artificialmetallic and robot-like sounds to create a voice resembling that of DonaldTrump to make the loudly shouted vowels sound more forced and comic.

The technical aspects of the creation of parody voices, which we have listed above,describe only a part of the process. In addition to these, we introduced many other

changes to the voices. It’s a rather difficult task to create a parody voice, whichrequires a creative approach and many hours of experiments.

Besides technical changes to the voices, we have also worked on the contentcomponent. Our app offers only humorous stories that are somehow related to acertain comic trait of a certain announcer. For example, for Joe Biden’s voice, wewrote the jokes about his friendship with Barack Obama.

Users can’t create any text of their own except the case of customized jokes wherethey can only have their name and surname voiced. These jokes are meant to behumorous in nature and subject to mandatory moderation. The watermark isattached to every video template.

As to the voices of the characters to which we provide unrestricted access, all ofthem were reconstructed using the data of actual parodists / voice actors whom wehired to make recordings of them reading certain texts to teach the neural networkand to whom we paid. It’s rather easy to find such parodists / voice actors usingplatforms like https://www.fiverr.com/. We also provide access to the voices ofcartoon characters only. When it comes to real people’s voices, we provide access tothe templates only.

In addition to the above-presented arguments, we realize that this sphere lackscomprehensive government regulation, that is why we don’t open the access to thetechnology and don’t provide our users with the opportunity to synthesize any textusing any voice. Moreover, we’re open to dialogue on this issue and we’re ready tohear every suggestion and comment and modify our product, if necessary. If youhave any questions, please, write at hello@parodist.ai. We’ll be happy to discuss this.
