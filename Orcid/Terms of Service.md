Terms of Use
============

* * *

### Introduction  

These Terms and Conditions of Use describe conditions under which ORCID allows the public to use the ORCID Registry and Websites.  Among the items included, there are:

* A license from ORCID to you regarding use of the ORCID software and the Registry, including to create an ORCID ID;
* A license from you to ORCID and the public to use data you deposit in the Registry;
* A list of impermissible activities and conditions under which ORCID may terminate your access to the Registry; and
* An explanation of the potential scope of liability for you and ORCID related to your use of the Registry and Websites. 

The Terms and Conditions of Use also contain a link to ORCID’s [Privacy Policy](https://info.orcid.org/privacy-policy/) which is part of the Terms and Conditions of Use.  We recommend that you read the full Terms and Conditions of Use below carefully as they create a legally binding agreement between you and ORCID.  

### 1.0 Welcome and Consent to Terms  

ORCID, Inc. (referred to as “ORCID”, “us” “our” and “we”) is a nonprofit organization that operates certain Websites at the orcid.org URL (“Websites”). Our mission is to solve the name ambiguity problem in research and scholarly communication by creating and operating an open-access registry (referred to as the “Registry”) of persistent unique identifiers for individual researchers.  We work collaboratively with the research community to establish open and transparent linking methods with other identifier schemes and research objects such as publications, grants and patents. Consistent with our mission, we offer use of the Registry, including obtaining an ORCID ID, free of charge to the public. 

By using our Website and Registry, whether by creating an ORCID Record, acting as a Trusted Individual, searching the Registry, or otherwise (including use through a public API which ORCID makes available for computer communication with the ORCID Registry), you are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions of Use, including ORCID’s [Privacy Policy](https://orcid.org/privacy-policy). Please read these Terms and Conditions of Use and the Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree to these Terms and Conditions of Use and the Privacy Policy, please refrain from using the Websites and Registry.  

If you have questions about our Websites and Registry, please [contact us by email](https://orcid.org/help/contact-us), or by mail at our main office at Executive Director, ORCID, Inc., 10411 Motor City Drive, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD, 20817, USA.

### 2\. Definitions  

In this document, we use “you” to refer to researchers and other users of the Websites and Registry.    We also use the following defined terms:

  
**ORCID Record:** The composite data set other than system data (e.g., user ID, password, log files), including the ORCID ID, pertaining to a specific individual and stored in the Registry.  
**ORCID Public API:** An application program interface available to the public to facilitate computer communication with the Registry.  
**Privacy Settings:** Settings that an individual or a Trusted Individual use to indicate the extent to which data should be publicly shared via the ORCID Registry.     
**Trusted Individual:** A person whom the Record Holder has given the authority to manage an ORCID Record on his or her behalf, including setting privacy settings, naming Trusted Organizations, and editing and depositing data. Trusted Individuals must agree to ORCID’s Terms and Conditions of Use.  
**Record Data:** The individual data elements in an ORCID Record, including the ORCID identifier and metadata associated with linked research objects. A link, but not the linked object itself (e.g., text or full metadata), is considered part of the Record Data.  
**Record Holder:** The owner of an ORCID Record.  
**Trusted Organization:** An ORCID member organization to which the Record Holder has given the right to view, edit, and/or deposit specific data in his or her ORCID Record. For example, you may grant a publisher the right to update information about your publications, or grant a funder the right to read information about grants that is otherwise not viewable by the public through the Registry.

### 3\. Your Right to Use the Registry  

The Websites and Registry contain technology that is owned by ORCID or third parties and content, including the Registry database, that are owned by ORCID or its third party licensors.  We grant you a limited license to make use of the ORCID software on which the ORCID Registry is based and the ORCID Public API to access and search the Registry.  In addition, we grant you a license to use any Record Data marked “Public,” subject to these Terms and Conditions of Use, including the limits described in the section Limitations on Use below.  By “use” we mean sublicense, reproduce, store, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display the Record Data for non-commercial and commercial uses.  If an ORCID Record contains links to full text articles or other materials, this license does not extend to the linked materials.  You may download and modify Record Data, but only in manner that does not make the data false or misleading.  We also grant you a license to use the Registry to obtain an ORCID identifier for yourself, and to create and manage an ORCID Record for yourself, and to manage an ORCID Record if you are named as a Trusted Individual, subject to these Terms and Conditions of Use.  You may not obtain an identifier and an ORCID Record for another person.  

If you are interested in other uses of the software platform on which the Registry is based, please note that where possible, we make ORCID software available on an open source basis. You can find additional information about the software and license at [https://orcid.org/about/community/orcid-technical-community](https://orcid.org/about/community/orcid-technical-community).

ORCID owns the ORCID trademark and logo displayed on the Websites. The license granted herein does not include a right to use the ORCID trademark or any other marks on the website without the express permission of the trademark owner.

All rights not explicitly granted herein are reserved.

### 4\. Depositing Data in the Registry  

ORCID seeks to support open access to information for the research community. ORCID shares with the public free of charge any data marked as Public through both the Registry and an annual data file (which we call the “Public Data File”) for viewing and use, including commercial uses.

If you deposit data in the ORCID Registry, you still own the data, but you grant a license to ORCID and its users to use the data. Specifically, by depositing any data (including links, but not the linked content) in the ORCID Registry, you grant ORCID and its users a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to sublicense, reproduce, store, modify, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display such data, subject to the Privacy Settings you or your Trusted Individual select. This license continues even after you stop using the Registry. You can remove information (other than the ORCID ID, which is always public, and your name and email address, which you can make private); however, if you previously made data publicly available through the Registry, there is no way to stop the public from continuing to use that data.

The Privacy Settings are summarized below and are described in more detail in the Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, which is part of these Terms and Conditions of Use.

  
**Public.** Data marked as Public will be available to the public for viewing and commercial and non-commercial use through an annual public data file which ORCID will release to the public under a Creative Commons CC0 Universal 1.0 Public Domain Dedication.  Consistent with the CC0 waiver, the public data file will not contain the restrictions on use set forth in these Terms and Conditions of use, but will include suggested community norms for use.    
**Limited Access.** Data marked Limited Access may be viewed through the Registry by the individual Record Holder or a designated Trusted Individual (if any). The individual Record Holder (or his/her Trusted Individual, if any) can elect to share a field or specific data within a field with Trusted Organizations. Trusted Organizations will have the on-going viewing, editing and/or updating rights to the specified Limited Access data, as indicated by the Record Holder (or his/her Trusted Individual). ORCID has no control over how a Trusted Organization uses the Limited Access data, including sharing it with others, although under their membership agreements, Trusted Organizations have indicated that they will not disclose Limited Access data unless (i) such data is publicly available from another source, or (ii) they provide notice to Record Holder regarding how and to whom such data will be disclosed.  
**Private.**  Data marked as Private may be viewed through the Registry only by the Record Holder and any designated Trusted Individual. Private data are not shared with the public, Trusted Organizations or other members of ORCID. Only our staff, and our agents’ or contractors’ staff, with a “need to know” to manage the Registry and process data for us are able to view Private and Limited Access data.

While you are not required to keep your ORCID Record current (other than your email address), we strongly encourage you to do so in order to increase the usefulness of the Registry for you and your colleagues in the research community.

### 5\. Representations and Warranties about Data You Deposit  

You represent and warrant to ORCID that:

* If you are an individual record creator, the ORCID Identifier you obtain and the ORCID Record you create is about you and does not misrepresent your identity in any manner.
* All data you deposit is true and correct at the time of deposit.  If you later discover that any data was not true and correct at the time of deposit, you must correct the data.
* The license you grant to ORCID and the public of any links to full texts, blogs, data sets, or other materials, or other content you deposit, does not infringe on the copyright or other rights of a third party. 

### 6\. Limitations on Use  

ORCID is a community-based initiative developed by and for the research community. We aim to create an accurate and secure Registry. We encourage you to consider community norms and expectations in using the Registry and information in the Registry. In addition, to help us ensure that ORCID is a useful and respected community resource, the following are explicitly prohibited in connection with the Registry:

* You may not obtain an ORCID ID and create an ORCID Record for anyone other than yourself.
* You may not edit or deposit data in any ORCID Record without the explicit consent of the Record Holder (i.e., by being designated as a Trusted Individual).
* You may not deposit types of data other than those permitted by a specified field and may not include any full works (e.g., full articles or other publications, blogs, or datasets) in such field; however, metadata and links are permitted.
* You may not obtain an ORCID ID and create an ORCID Record about yourself if you are under 18 years of age (or the age of majority in jurisdiction in which you are located).
* You may not use the Websites or Registry for any unlawful, illegal (in the United States and any jurisdiction in which you are located), or injurious purpose or to publish, post, distribute, receive, or disseminate defamatory, infringing, confidential, obscene, or other unlawful material or to threaten, harass, stalk, abuse, or other otherwise violate the legal rights (including without limitation, the rights of privacy and publicity) of any third party.
* You may not deposit, edit, modify or otherwise use any Record Data in a manner that makes it false, incomplete or misleading.
