Frequently Asked Questions
=====================================

The WiGLE WiFi Android Client: Why Does WiGLE WiFi ask to access...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**...my WiFi state?**

As a network detection package, WiGLE WiFi Wardriving records WiFi Networks when your device can see them.

**...my cellular network state?**

As a network detection package, WiGLE WiFi Wardriving records cell Networks when your device can see them. It also detects when you're in a voice call and mutes the audio output so we don't interfere with your conversation.

**...my internet connection?**

In order to upload network observations, check stats and status, receive news, and download observation data, internet access is required.

**...my external storage and files?**

To record observations and stage files, it may help to use larger external storage on your device.

**...my camera?**

In recent versions of the OS, WiGLE WiFi Wardriving can save you the trouble of typing your username and password using a QR code from the WiGLE Website for logged-in users.

WiGLE WiFi Android Client: How it interacts with the website
------------------------------------------------------------

**How do you keep my identity and location safe?**

Just like the website, WiGLE WiFi Wardriving doesn't require real identifying information. We may profile your device, but don't need or want information that could be used to identify it directly. Your observed networks and traces are available directly _only_ to you, but not traceable to you. If you're the first person to observe any individual network, you'll be credited with its discovery internally but the publicly accessible network data will not list your name. As a website, WiGLE doesn't re-vend your individual observations, only a trilaterated location based on a number of observations by any number of participants.
