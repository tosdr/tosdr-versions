5\. Lawful basis for the processing of personal data
----------------------------------------------------

Our organisation’s infrastructure means that all personal data is processed on common platforms. We have processes in place to make sure that only those people related to the organisation (staff, board, steering group), who need to access your data can do so. By default, only the organisations’ staff have access to all collected personal data and others, such as board and steering group members, as well as our volunteers, are granted access on an as-needed basis.

Some data may be shared with third parties and, where this happens, this is always indicated in the relevant registry description.

Before we ask for your data, we always apply the following tests to determine whether it is appropriate:

* Purpose test – why are we collecting this data?
* Necessity test – is it essential that we collect this data?

We collect the following types of personal information on the legal grounds of legitimate interests, contractual performance, and/or consent where applicable:

Types of personal information collected

* Name
* Email
* City, country, and/or continent of residence
* Gender
* Phone number
* Twitter ID
* Linkedin ID
* Facebook ID
* Address
* Job title
* Date of birth
* T-shirt size
* Dietary information
* Photo
* Billing details

6\. Your rights as a data subject
---------------------------------

As a data subject whose personal information we hold, you have certain rights. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email datarequest(at)mydata.org or use the information supplied in the Contact us section on our website. In order to process your request, we will need to verify your identity.

Your rights are as follows:

The right to be informed

As a data controller, we are obliged to provide clear and transparent information about our data processing activities. This is provided by this privacy notice and any related communications we may send you.

* What types of data we have
* Who can access your data
* For how long we foresee storing this data

If there are exceptional circumstances that mean we can refuse to provide the information, we will explain them. Otherwise, we will comply with all data requests. If answering requests is likely to require additional time, we will inform you.

The right to erasure (the ‘right to be forgotten’)

Where no overriding legal basis or legitimate reason continues to exist for processing personal data, you may request that we delete the personal data. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure erasure.

The right to restrict processing

* Processing is based on legitimate interest;
* Processing is for the purpose of direct marketing; or
* Processing is for the purposes of scientific or historical research.

7\. Security measures
---------------------

We have what we believe are appropriate security controls in place to protect personal data. Risk assessment, including assessing risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, is at the heart of our project. We do not, however, have any control over what happens between your device and the boundary of our information infrastructure. You should be aware of the many information security risks that exist and take appropriate steps to safeguard your own information. We accept no liability in respect of breaches that occur beyond our sphere of control.
