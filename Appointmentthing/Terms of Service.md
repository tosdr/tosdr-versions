    4. **Suspension of Services.** AddEvent may limit or suspend the Services from time to time at our discretion (for example, to perform scheduled maintenance). If AddEvent limits or suspends the Services, we will endeavor to give the Customer reasonable advance notice so that the Customer can plan around it. However, there may be some situations, such as security emergencies, where it may not be practicable for AddEvent to give advance notice. AddEvent will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of the suspension or limitation as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action.

AddEvent will not be responsible for any act or omission of the third party, including such third party’s use of the customer’s information.
