PRIVACY POLICY
--------------

Who we are
----------

**Suggested text:** We are a content marketing and SEO company and our website address is: https://www.contentspotlight.org.

Comments
--------

**Suggested text:** When visitors leave comments on the site, we collect the data shown in the comments form including name, email address and website name to help spam detection.

Embedded content from other websites
------------------------------------

**Suggested text:** Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

How long we retain your data
----------------------------

**Suggested text:** If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

What rights you have over your data
-----------------------------------

**Suggested text:** If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. We do not send your personal data to anyone. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
