This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions ([https://www.webshare.io/terms](https://www.webshare.io/terms)).

If you are based in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“UK”), additional rights and procedures applicable to your personal information are set forth in our [Additional EEA, Switzerland and UK Privacy Disclosures](https://www.webshare.io/privacy-notice-for-eea-switzerland-and-uk).

* **_Single Sign-On._** We may use single sign-on ("SSO") to allow a user to authenticate their account using one set of login information, including through Google. We will have access to certain information from those third parties in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by those third parties, which may include, for example, your name and email address. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.  We may also send you service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, purchase confirmation, customer support, changes, or updates to features of the Service, and technical and security notices).
