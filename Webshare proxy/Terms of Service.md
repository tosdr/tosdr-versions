By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. Webshare reserves the right to modify these Terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below (section 13.2.). These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service (“**Users**”).

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 12.2 (THE “**ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**”) AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION IN SECTION 12.3 (THE “**CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER**”) THAT REQUIRE, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS IN SECTION 12.2, THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US, INCLUDING ANY CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED BEFORE YOU AGREED TO THESE TERMS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST WEBSHARE, AS WELL AS YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST WEBSHARE.

These Terms constitute a legally binding contract between you and Webshare. You must read and agree to these Terms before using the Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Webshare, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. If you agree to these Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then “you” includes you and that entity and you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf. Any use of or access to the Service by anyone under 18 is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Webshare.

**1.2 Limited License**

Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your internal business use only as permitted by Webshare or the features of a particular Service. Webshare reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Webshare Content (as defined in Section 2). Webshare may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.

**1.3 User Accounts**

Your account on the Service (your “**User Account**”) gives you access to the Service and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of Users. By connecting to the Service with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service. 

You may never use another User’s User Account without permission. When creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your User Account, and you must keep your User Account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your User Account. You must notify Webshare immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your User Account. Webshare will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your User Account.

You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your settings page. By providing Webshare your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out; opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

**1.4 Service Rules**

You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium; (ii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iii) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (iv) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our or any target website’s infrastructure; (v) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vi) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (vii) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (viii) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (ix) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; (x) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein; (xiii) reselling or otherwise redistributing the Service (unless explicitly agreed otherwise with Webshare); (xiv) using the Service to attempt security breaches (e.g. accessing any server, network, host or account which you are not authorized to access); (xv) using the Service to attempt any disruptions of internet communications (e.g. denial of service attack); (xvi) using the Service for the purposes of ticket buying bots, ad frauds or to collect data that is not publicly available or otherwise protected due to its sensitivity;  or (xvii) using the Service for any purpose in breach of any applicable law, regulation, Terms of Service/Terms of Use or third party rights. You agree to provide complete ID verification if Webshare suspects any of the above prohibited activities are conducted by your account. Failure to complete ID verification will result in account suspension.

Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by these Terms.

**1.6 Subscriptions**

A subscription may be procured through the Services interface, or in some cases, via an order form entered into between Users and us (each an “**Order Form**”). Subscriptions commence when we make them available to Customer and continue for the term specified in the Services or in the Order Form, as applicable (the “**Subscription Period**”). 

**1.7 Disputes with Other Users**

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. Webshare shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.

**12\. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**

**12.1 Governing Law.** You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“**FAA**”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 12.2 and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

**12.2 Arbitration.** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WEBSHARE. This Section 12.2 (the “**Arbitration Agreement**”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Webshare that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Webshare, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“**Claim**” or collectively, “**Claims**”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to these Terms. 

If you are a new Webshare User, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing Webshare at \[legal@webshare.io\] with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.

For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at [**legal@webshare.io**](mailto:legal@webshare.io) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Webshare has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “**Arbitrator**”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “**Rules**”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control. AAA may be contacted at [**www.adr.org**](http://www.adr.org/), where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or San Francisco, California unless you and Webshare agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and Arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (A) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (B) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (C) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Webshare agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.

Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Webshare from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.  

If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver in Section 12.3 is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

**12.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.** WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND WEBSHARE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER WEBSHARE USERS. YOU AND WEBSHARE FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WEBSHARE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. 

**13\. General**

**13.1 Assignment.** These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Webshare without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

**13.2 Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms.** Webshare may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Webshare in our sole discretion. Webshare reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms. Webshare is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. 

Webshare may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time. When we change these Terms, we will post the updated Terms on our website and notify you that changes have been made to these Terms. Any updated Terms shall be deemed accepted and become effective 30 days after such notification, unless you provide Webshare with a written rejection of the updated Terms, in which case, the Terms shall continue under its original provisions until the end of your ongoing Subscription Period and the updated Terms shall become effective at the start of your next Subscription Period or your purchase of any other Service, whichever is earlier. If you do not agree to these Terms or any updated Terms, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service. Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of the Terms or effective date of any updated Terms will confirm your consent and acceptance thereto. You also recognize and agree that Webshare’s [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.webshare.io/privacy-policy) is not incorporated into these Terms and may be revised and updated by Webshare at any time in its sole discretion, with or without following the procedures of this Section 13.2.

**13.3 Entire Agreement/Severability.** These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Webshare in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Webshare concerning the Service. Except as otherwise stated in Section 12.2, if any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.

**13.4 No Waiver.** No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Webshare’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**13.5 Contact.** Please contact us at [**legal@webshare.io**](mailto:legal@webshare.io) with any questions regarding these Terms.
