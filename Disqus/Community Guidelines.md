Although impersonating or portraying another person in a confusing or deceptive manner is against our terms of service, parody accounts are okay - as long as they meet the requirements below.

Requirements for parody accounts
================================

Avatar
------

The avatar must not be exactly the same as the account it is parodying. This includes the default avatar.

Display Name
------------

The display name must not be exactly the same as the account it is parodying without an additional distinguishing word such as "not" or "fake". If the display name is different only in subtle changes of spelling, it must also be accompanied by a distinguishing word.

Bio
---

The bio must include a statement that distinguishes it from the account it is parodying. For instance, a bio could say, "this a parody account" or "not affiliated with..."

How do I report impersonation?
==============================

Click the [flag](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1774987-user-flagging) icon in the profile of the user who is impersonating your account and complete a short survey. Please be sure to include the email address associated with the account being impersonated for verification purposes.

What happens when an impersonation complaint is reported?
=========================================================

The case will be reviewed and if the account doesn't comply with the above requirements (or is otherwise found to be portraying another person in a confusing or deceptive manner) the profile of the account will be set back to default and the user will have an opportunity to update their profile information abiding by the above requirements. Repeated violations may result in an account getting banned or deactivated.

Have questions?
