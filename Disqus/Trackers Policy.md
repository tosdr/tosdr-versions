**Cookies and Data Recipients**

Disqus uses cookies and allows partners to also set cookies through the Service in order to facilitate cross-context behavioral advertising. Cookies are unique identifiers that are matched with other cookies and other information, which may include Identifying Information.  
​  
We work with [LiveRamp](https://liveramp.com/) to help marketers connect browsers and devices with data from other sources that has been obfuscated to remove any directly identifying information. LiveRamp provides a [privacy policy](https://liveramp.com/service-privacy-policy/) and [opt-out options](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/). We share information that we collect from you, such as your email (in an encoded form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our identity partners/service providers, including LiveRamp Inc. LiveRamp matches your email with an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online, in-app, and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. To opt-out of this use, please [click here.](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out)  
​

We share your web browsing activity with [Viglink](https://www.viglink.com/) to allow advertisers to personalize ads based on the types of products and services in which you seem to be interested. You may read Viglink’s [privacy policy](https://www.viglink.com/legal/privacy/) and [opt-out.](https://www.viglink.com/opt-out/)

**Cookies**

Disqus uses 'authentication' cookies, e.g., sessionid, disqusauth, and disqusauths, to keep you logged in from your web browser and personalize your Disqus experience.

Disqus uses 'unique' cookies, e.g., disqus\_unique and \_jid, to associate web-based activities with a page load and with a web browser, including activities that violate our Terms of Service, and understand your interests and product usage.

When Disqus loads ads, we use ad serving technologies from [Google](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) that may set cookies for the purposes of personalized marketing, associating ads with later activities, and limiting how often you are shown specific ads.  
​  
​**OTHER THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING PARTNERS**

We work with several third party partners to serve relevant advertising within the Disqus comment embed on partner websites. We do not share your information with these partners, however, in the course of serving or displaying ads through Disqus, these partners may place a cookie on your browser. We expect all third party partners to follow all relevant privacy laws and regulations when serving ads through Disqus.
