The Users shall moreover be responsible for any use of their Identifiers, for instance if they pre-record their Identifiers on their computer, smartphone or any other type of terminal, to enable automatic connection to the Account.

----------------------------------

If, for any given reason, Pearltrees considers that a User is not complying with these T&Cs, including the obligations that are listed above, Pearltrees may at any point in time, and at its entire discretion, eliminate or suspend the User’s account and take all requisite legal measures against that User, bearing in mind that no decision shall be taken without first informing the User, giving a reasonable period of notice to remedy the violation, save in case of gross misconduct by the User.

Pearltrees shall be entitled to retain evidence of the violations that are witnessed by archiving them with a third party service provider for as long as is necessary to resolve the dispute.

9.       Liability
------------------

Pearltrees shall be liable to Users for the proper performance of the obligations arising from these T&Cs.

Pearltrees shall not be liable for any failure to perform these T&Cs that may be blamed on the User, a third party to this contract, or any event that is beyond its control and that cannot be reasonably foreseen.

In its capacity as a mere service provider, Pearltrees hereby disclaims liability for any information, messages and publications disclosed by the Users in the Account and for the Collections published by the Users, such as on account of the content aggregated within these Collections.

Pearltrees shall do everything in its power to guarantee uninterrupted access to the Platform and to the Account and continuous provision of the Service but may not under any circumstance bear liability if, due to any unavailability linked to maintenance operations or to a failure of the Internet network or any other reason beyond its control or force majeure, a User cannot temporarily access the Platform and/or the Account.

Similarly, although Pearltrees does everything possible to ensure the security of the information and data stored on its Platform, it cannot guarantee the lack of any risk of intrusions, data piracy or contamination by computer viruses pursuant to using the Platform. It is therefore up to the Users to take all the necessary precautions for ensuring the security of their data and the protection of their computer systems against contamination by viruses or other forms of attacks that may occur upon the use of the Platform.
