Please contact us if you need assistance with anything. We want you to be aware that by changing certain preferences you might cause the page to not work correctly, or at all, and that would be very sad, wouldn’t it? Changing the settings, also, would not remove advertising from the site, but would instead make it less relevant and even more annoying.

Cookies are stored both if you are a registered user of a social network and if you do not have an account with the relevant social network. We do not have access to the personal data collected about you and can only obtain statistical information from the administrators of the social networks about the traffic of the Social Media Accounts.

Headquarters of the majority of the social media networks administrators are established in third countries (mostly, USA), so visiting our Social Media Accounts may result in transfer of your personal data to third countries (mostly, USA). We recommend that you read the privacy notices of third parties and contact the social media networks’ administrators directly if you have any questions about how they use your personal data.

**6\. How the information may be shared?**

Your personal data may be transferred to our data processors, such as IT or cloud service companies (e.g. when we rent servers from an IT company, your personal data will be physically hosted (stored) with that IT company).  We require our data processors to ensure adequate protection of your data and ensure that they process your personal data only for the purposes for which we have instructed them to do so and only under our written instructions.

Personal data may also be transferred to recipients who act as data controllers (separately or jointly with us). For example, social network operators, banks, payment service providers (for payments for paid services), etc.

If you have any questions about our service providers, please contact us at the email address listed in our Privacy Policy.

In addition to the specific recipients of the data identified in this Privacy Policy, we may also disclose information about you:

— if we are required to do so by law (e.g. by a court or law enforcement authority);

— when you intend to sell the business or part of its assets by disclosing your personal data to a potential buyer of the business or part of the business;

— the sale of the company’s business or a substantial part of its assets to a third party.

— Where necessary to protect our rights and legitimate interests.

Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not provide your personal data to any third parties.

**7\. Your rights**

In this section, we provide information about your rights in relation to our processing of your personal data and when you can exercise these rights. If you would like more information about your rights or to exercise them, please contact us at the email address set out in this Privacy Policy.

We will provide you with information on the action taken following your request for the exercise of your rights without undue delay, but at the latest within one (1) month of receipt of the request. Depending on the complexity of the request and the number of requests received, the aforementioned time limit may be extended for a further 2 (two) months. In this case, we will inform you within 1 (one) month of receipt of the request of such extension and the reasons for it. The company will only refuse to exercise your rights in cases provided for by law.

**Right of access to your personal data**

We want you to fully understand how we use your personal data so that you do not experience any inconvenience. You can contact us at any time to enquire whether we are processing any of your personal data. If we store or use your personal data in any way, you have the right to access it. To do so, please submit a written request to us at the email address set out in this Privacy Policy, confirm your identity; and observe the principles of fairness and reasonableness when making such a request.

**Right to withdraw consent**

If you have given us your explicit consent to the processing of your data, you can withdraw it at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of consent-based processing carried out before the withdrawal of consent.

**Additional rights**

Below you will find information about additional rights that you may have, which you can exercise by following the procedures described below.

(a) You have the right to ask us to correct any inaccuracies in the data we hold. In this case, we may ask you to confirm the corrected information.

(b) You have the right to ask us to delete your personal data. This right shall be exercised in the cases provided for in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

(c) You have the right to ask us to restrict or not to process your personal data:

— the period of time necessary to verify the accuracy of your personal data when you make a complaint about the accuracy of the data;

— where our collection, storage or use of your personal data is unlawful, but you choose not to request erasure;

— where we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim;

— the period necessary to determine whether we have an overriding legal basis to continue processing your personal data if you have exercised your right to object to the processing of personal data.

(d) You have the right to the transfer of data processed by automated means which we have received from you in a structured, commonly used and computer-readable format with your consent or for the purposes of concluding a contract (right to data portability). If you exercise this right, we will, at your request, transfer a copy of the data provided by you to you or to a data controller of your choice.

(e) You have the right to object to our use of your personal data in accordance with Article 21 of the GDPR. You have the right to object when your personal data is processed on the basis of legitimate interest (for each of the above purposes of processing, it is indicated on which basis the data is processed) or for direct marketing purposes.

**Right to request more information**

We hope that you will understand that it is very difficult to discuss all possible ways of collecting and using personal data. We do our best to provide as clear and complete information as possible and we undertake to update this Privacy Policy if the process of using personal data changes. However, if you have any questions about our use of your personal data, we will be happy to answer them or provide you with any additional information we may disclose. If you have any specific questions or do not understand the information provided, please contact us.

**Complaints**
