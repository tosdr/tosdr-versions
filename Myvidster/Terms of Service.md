10\. 18 U.S.C. § 2257 STATEMENT

The Website allows users to collect and share bookmarks to third-party video content hosted on third-party websites. MyVidster does not create any video content. As such, MyVidster is not a producer (primary or secondary) of any of the content found on the Website. With respect to the records required by 18 U.S.C. § 2257 for any and all content found on the Website, please direct your request to the third-party site for which the content was produced. For further assistance and/or information in finding the content's originating site, please contact MyVidster compliance at [copyright@myvidster.com](mailto:copyright@myvidster.com).

The Website allows registered users and visitors to flag content to be flagged as inappropriate. We will promptly remove any content flagged as illegal, unlawful, harassing, harmful, or offensive. Users of the Website who encounter such content are urged to flag it by clicking 'flag as inappropriate' link found below each video.

11\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

MyVidster respects the intellectual property of others. By bookmarking video content on the Website, you represent and warrant that such public display does not constitute copyright infringement or violation of any other intellectual property rights.

In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512 ("DMCA"), we will respond promptly to claims of copyright infringement that are reported to the agent that we have designated to receive notifications of claims of infringement (our “Designated Agent”). Our Designated Agent may be reached via email at: [copyright@myvidster.com](mailto:copyright@myvidster.com), and via regular mail at: Marques Gunter SalsaIndy LLC, 815-A Brazos Street #365 Austin, TX 78701.

If you are a copyright owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner) and have a good faith belief that your work’s copyright has been infringed, please report your notice of infringement to use by providing our Designated Agent with a written notification of claimed infringement that includes substantially the following: (i) your contact information, including your name, address, telephone number, and email address; (ii) identification and description of each copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (iii) the exact URL or location of the material that you claim is infringing; (iv) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (v) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; and (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owners.

Please note that Section 512(f) of the DMCA may impose liability for damages on any person who knowingly sends meritless notices of infringement. Please do not make false claims.

Upon receipt of a bona fide infringement notification by the Designated Agent, it is our policy to expeditiously remove or disable access to the infringing material, notify the registered user of its violation of the DMCA and these Terms and, for repeat offenders, we may also terminate such registered user’s access to the Website.

In particular, upon receipt of a notice complying or substantially complying with the DMCA, MyVidster may send the registered user, who initially linked to the allegedly infringing material and first introduced it to the MyVidster website (the “Original Linker”), a notice that it has violated these Terms and Conditions and the DMCA. Upon receiving a third notice from the same copyright owner that a particular registered user – who is an Original Linker and has already received two violation notices – has linked to an allegedly infringing video, MyVidster may consider that user to be a repeat infringer, and may disable that user’s account. Upon termination of that account, MyVidster may disclose to the copyright owner the following personal information relating to that user, to the extent MyVidster possesses such information: first and last name, login history (which includes date, time and IP address at time of login), email address, internet protocol (IP) address, physical and billing address, and last four digits of the user’s credit card. Please see MyVidster’s [Privacy Policy](http://www.myvidster.com/docs/privacy) for further details about how MyVidster collects and shares user information.

If we remove or disable access to content in response to an infringement notice, we will make reasonable attempts to contact the owner or administrator of the affected content. If your material has been removed and you believe that your material does not constitute infringement, you may provide MyVidster with a counter notification by written communication to the attention of "DMCA Counter Notification Dept." at copyright@myvidster.com that sets forth all of the necessary information required by the DMCA (http://www.copyright.gov/title17/ 92chap5.html#512). Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material does not constitute copyright infringement. If you are uncertain whether an activity constitutes infringement, we recommended seeking advice of an attorney.

12\. APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE TOOL

We provide webmasters with access to a back-end application program interface (API) tool that allows webmasters to see the source of allegedly infringing content and directly remove links to infringing content appearing on the Website, including the entire post, page and/or comments associated with that link; provided that the webmaster has first authenticated itself to MyVidster, requested access to the API tool and been granted access by MyVidster.

13\. TERMINATION

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate or restrict access or discontinue service to the Website (or any portions, components, or features of the Website) to you or anyone else, for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, at any time, without notice or liability. Failure to comply with these Terms may, among other things, result in the immediate termination of your access to and use of the Website.

Upon being notified that your access is terminated, you must destroy any materials you have obtained from the Website. You may not access the Website after your access is terminated without our written approval. After terminating your access, we will retain all rights, including all intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, and licenses retained in these Terms, and the limitations upon your use and treatment of Content will remain in full force.

In a jurisdiction that does not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for certain damages, the liability of MyVidster and our Representatives will be limited in accordance with these Terms to the extent permitted by law.

Without limiting any of the foregoing, if we or any of our Representatives are found liable to you or to any third party as a result of any claims or other matters arising under or in connection with these Terms, the Website, or your use of the Website, the maximum liability for all such claims and other matters will not exceed $100 in any calendar year.

16\. INDEMNITY

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless MyVidster, its parent corporation, officers, directors, members, managers, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees) arising from:

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Texas and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. You consent to service of process in any legal proceeding.

If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any term, clause or provision and such invalid term, clause or provision shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms.
