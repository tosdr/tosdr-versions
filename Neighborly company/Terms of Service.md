Responsibility For User-Generated Content Posted on or Through This Site
------------------------------------------------------------------------

_You are responsible for User-Generated Content that you post._ Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any UGC.

This means that you, not Neighborly, are entirely responsible for all UGC that you post and that you can be held personally liable for comments that are defamatory, obscene, or libelous, or that violate these Terms of Use, an obligation of confidentiality, or the rights of others. You represent and warrant that for all UGC: (i) you own or have all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to use and grant Neighborly authority to use all intellectual property or proprietary rights therein; and (ii) you have the appropriate consent and permission of each identifiable individual in the UGC to use their name, image, and likeness.

Because we do not control the UGC posted on or through this Site, we cannot and do not warrant or guarantee the truthfulness, integrity, suitability, or quality of that UGC. You also agree and understand that by accessing this Site, you may encounter UGC that you may consider to be objectionable. We have no responsibility for any UGC, including without limitation any errors or omissions therein.

We are not liable for any loss or damage of any kind you may claim was incurred because of the use of any UGC posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available on or through this Site. The UGC posted on or through this Site expresses the personal opinions of the individuals who posted it and does not necessarily reflect the views of Neighborly or any person or entity associated with Neighborly.

_You own User-Generated Content, but we may use it._ You understand that whether or not UGC is published, we do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any UGC. You own the copyright in any original UGC you post. We do not claim any copyrights in UGC.

However, by using this Site you are granting us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, a nonexclusive, fully paid, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly display and perform, publish, transmit, remove, retain repurpose, and commercialize UGC you post in any and all media or form of communication whether now existing or hereafter developed, without obtaining additional consent, without restriction, notification, or attribution, and without compensating you in any way, and to authorize others to do the same.

For this reason, we ask that you not post any UGC that you do not wish to license to us, including any photographs, videos, confidential information, or product ideas.

_We may disclose and/or remove User-Generated Content._ Neighborly has certain rights. We have the right (but do not assume the obligation) to:

* monitor all UGC
* require that you avoid certain subjects.
* remove or block any UGC at any time without notice at our sole and absolute discretion.
* disclose any UGC and the identity of the user who posted it in response to a subpoena or whenever we believe that disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order, to prevent or investigate a possible crime or other violation of law, to protect the rights of Neighborly or others, or to enforce these Terms of Use, and
* terminate your access to and use of this Site, or to modify, edit or block your transmissions thereto in our sole discretion.

You agree that our exercise of such discretion shall not render us the owners of UGC you post, and that you will retain ownership thereof as described above.

_Restrictions on User-Generated Content._ It is a condition of these Terms of Use that you do not:

* upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available:

* any UGC that is unlawful, harmful, hateful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, racially disparaging, indecent, or invasive of another’s privacy.
* any UGC that constitutes or encourages activity illegal under criminal or civil law.
* any UGC that is false, misleading, or fraudulent.
* any UGC that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information or proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements).
* any UGC that violates or infringes upon the rights of others, including UGC which violates the patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, trade secret rights, confidentiality rights, contract rights, or any other rights of any individual, living or deceased, or any legal entity.
* any UGC that contains the image, name, or likeness of anyone other than yourself, unless (i) that person is at least eighteen years old, and you have first obtained his/her express written permission or (ii) that person is under eighteen years old but you are his/her parent or legal guardian.
* any request for or solicitation of any personal or private information from any individual.
* any request for or solicitation of money, goods, or services for private gain.
* any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment, or
* any UGC that contains advertising, promotions, or marketing, or which otherwise has a commercial purpose.

* impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity, or
* violate any local, state, national or international law, rule, or regulation.

By posting User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that (i) you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the UGC and have the right to grant the license set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the UGC is accurate, and (iii) you have read, understood, and your UGC fully complies with these Terms of Use and applicable laws and will not cause injury to any person or entity.

Removal of Content
------------------

_In general._ You can seek removal of objectionable UGC by contacting us using the information provided [below](https://www.neighborly.com/terms-of-use#Questions). We will review all such requests and will remove UGC that we determine should be removed, in our sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms of Use and applicable law. Please be aware, however, that if the UGC has already been distributed to other websites or published in other media, we will not be able to recapture and delete it. Also, a back-up or residual copy of the UGC we remove from this Site may remain on back-up servers.

_Violation of copyrights._ Neighborly does not knowingly violate or permit others to violate the copyrights of others. We will promptly remove or disable access to material that we know is infringing or if we become aware of circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.

If you are requesting removal of content because of a violation of your copyrights, please note that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.

Your notice must be in writing and must include:

* an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest.
* a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed.
* a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on this Site (including the URL, title and/or item number if applicable, or other identifying characteristics).
* your name, address, telephone number, and email address, and, if you are not the owner of the copyright, the name of the owner, and
* a written statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law, and
* a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

Your statement must be sent to: [\[email protected\]](https://www.neighborly.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon us actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident.
