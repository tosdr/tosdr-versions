Scope of This Policy
--------------------

This online privacy policy (this “Policy”) applies only to information collected through Neighborly-Owned websites on which it is posted. It does not apply to third-party platforms, such as websites owned by our franchisees, social media websites, vendor pages, websites of other corporations, limited liability companies, etc. or to Neighborly-owned websites or other Neighborly owned platforms on which it is not posted. It also does not apply to information collected through other channels, such as over the phone or in person.

By installing any third-party application, you are authorizing such third-party application to perform the actions and/or share with the third-party application the information communicated to Neighborly, or requested from Neighborly to perform the actions and/or share with the third-party application the information communicated to Neighborly, or requested from Neighborly. Neighborly is going to send that information through the third-party application, which will then go through the internet. Neighborly shall not be held responsible for any dissemination, use, misuse, and/or disclosure of the user's information through use of this or any third-party application.

Some of the information we collect through this Site may be “personal information”—information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. Other information may be non-personally identifiable, such as information collected by cookies.

This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by additional privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”), provided at the time we collect your information. For example, certain pages of this Site may contain Privacy Notices providing more details about the information we collect on those particular pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. In other cases, specific Privacy Notices may be required to comply with the privacy laws of one of the countries, provinces, or states in which we do business.

Your Consent
------------

By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you). If you do not consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you), you may not use this Site. If you have questions about this Policy, or any Privacy Notice, please contact us using the information provided [in the section below](#Questions).

Our Terms of Use
----------------

This Policy is part of the [Terms of Use](https://www.neighborly.com/terms-of-use) that govern your use of this Site. A link to our [Terms of Use](https://www.neighborly.com/terms-of-use) is provided at the bottom of each page of this Site.

Your Choices
------------

_In General._ We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and disclose your information. This Policy describes some of your choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving “[cookies](#Cookies).” We may ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your information.

_Do Not Track Mechanisms_. California law requires this Policy to address how we respond to any “Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) signal” delivered by your browser. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.

_Previously Expressed Preferences._ You may change previously expressed preferences regarding how we use your information. If at any time you wish to be taken off our mailing lists, please contact us using the information provided [contact section below](#Questions).

This Policy May Change
----------------------

Neighborly reserves the right to update or modify this Policy and any Privacy Notice, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of the Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site. These changes will only apply to the information we collect after we have posted the revised Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site.

Your use of this Site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all information collected from or about you after the revised Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Policy. You may access the current version of this Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked “Privacy” at the bottom of each page of the public areas of this Site.

Information We Collect
----------------------

_Information You Manually Provide_. Neighborly collects the information you manually provide (using your keyboard, mouse, or touchpad) when you use this Site, for example, we collect the information you provide when you request service, express interest in becoming a franchisee, send us questions, or otherwise interact with this Site. Some of the information you manually provide may be personal information, such as your name and contact information.

_Information from Third-Party Social Media Platforms._ You may be able to register with, log on to, or enhance your profile on this Site by choosing to automatically populate the requested data fields with information you previously provided to a third-party social media platform (such as Facebook or Twitter). By doing this, you are asking the third-party platform to send us information, including personal information, from your profile on that platform. We treat that information as we do any other information you give to us when you register, log on, or enhance your profile.

_Information from Your Browser or Device._ Neighborly collects information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser or mobile device. This information typically includes your IP address, the name of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit.

The information we receive may depend on your browser or device settings. The information we receive from your web browser and device typically is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable. However, we may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with information that does identify you.

_Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies_. We use “cookies” and other technologies to collect information and support certain features of this Site. For example, we may use these technologies to:

* collect information about the ways visitors use this Site—which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page.
* support the features and functionality of this Site—for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits.
* personalize your experience when you use this Site, and
* improve our marketing efforts, including through use of targeted advertising.

The information we collect using cookies and similar technologies is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable, but we may link it to personal information that you provide. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit this Site, you may be unable to use all the functionality of this Site if your browser rejects our cookies.

Information About Third-Party Cookies
-------------------------------------

In addition to the cookies, Neighborly delivers to your computer or mobile device through this Site, certain third parties may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our Sites. To learn more about Google Analytics, [read the Google Analytics definition here.](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html)

Other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer or mobile device for the purpose of tracking your online behaviors over time and across nonaffiliated websites and/or delivering targeted advertisements either on this Site or on other websites.

You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our Sites. For example, if you don’t want information about your visit to this Site sent to Google Analytics, you may download an Opt-out Browser Add-on by [selecting a browser add-on here.](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en) Please note that the Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to Neighborly.

In addition, if you would like to opt-out of having interest-based information collected by certain entities during your visits to this Site or other websites, please [select collection opt-out here.](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) You will be directed to an industry-developed website that contains mechanisms for choosing whether each listed entity may collect and use data for online behavioral advertising purposes.

It may be that some of the third parties that collect interest-based information on this Site do not participate in the industry-developed opt-out website, in which case the best way to avoid third-party tracking of your online behaviors may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies. Please note that the industry-developed opt-out mechanism is device and browser specific. If you wish to opt-out from having interest-based information collected by participating entities across all devices and browsers, you need take the steps outlined above from each device and browser.

* to provide you with effective customer service.
* to provide you with a personalized experience when you use this Site.
* to contact you with information and notices related to your use of this Site.
* to contact you with special offers and other information we believe will be of interest to you (in accordance with any privacy preferences you have expressed to us).

We transfer customer information to franchisees, service providers, vendors and other companies who globally support our business, such as providing services requested through this website, technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, facilitating payments, or conducting surveys. These companies must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this privacy policy and the agreements we enter into with them.

How We Share Your Information
-----------------------------

_With Third-Party Vendors_. Neighborly shares information collected through this Site with third-party vendors who act for us or on our behalf. For example, we may use third-party vendors to design and operate this Site; to conduct surveys; and to help us with our promotional efforts. These third-party vendors may need information about you to perform their functions.

_With Other Users of this Site_. You may be able to submit User-Generated Content on or through this Site. In this Policy, “User-Generated Content” or “UGC” refers to content that you post using the social networking tools we make available to you and that does not constitute “Feedback” (as that term is defined in our [Terms of Use](https://www.neighborly.com/terms-of-use). Any personal information contained in UGC can be read, collected, or used by others.

In addition, we may use UGC you submit for advertising campaigns and other promotions. We may or may not use your name in connection with such use, and we may or may not seek your consent before using the content for such purposes. Therefore, you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to UGC you submit on or through this Site.

_With Third-Party Social Media Platforms._ We may provide functionality on this Site that allows you to automatically post information about the actions you take on this Site to a third-party social media platform (such as Facebook or Twitter). If you choose to take advantage of this functionality, people with access to your profile on the third-party platform may be able to see the actions you have taken—for example, the products or services you have purchased. Thus, you should have no expectation of privacy in those actions.

Further, if you choose to link your profile on this Site with an account on a third-party social media platform, we may share the information in your profile with that third-party platform. We may also use third-party social media platforms to offer you interest-based ads. To offer such ads, we may convert your email address into a unique value which can be matched by our partner company with a user on their platform. Although we do not provide any personal information to these platform vendors, they may gain insights about individuals who respond to the ads we serve.

_Within Neighborly Corporate Family._ We may share information collected through this Site with other companies in Neighborly corporate structure. These affiliate companies are permitted to use your information for their own marketing purposes and in a manner otherwise consistent with this Policy.

_With our Franchisees_. We may share information collected through this Site with our franchisees, which may be permitted to use your information for their own marketing purposes and in any manner otherwise consistent with this Policy.

_With Other, Carefully Selected Business Partners_. From time to time, we may share your information with selected third parties for their own marketing purposes. For example, we may partner with third parties to sponsor contests or other promotions, and we may share with these third parties the information you submit to us to participate in the contest or take advantage of the promotion. Before doing so, however, we may offer you the opportunity to “opt out” or “opt in,” as required by applicable law. We do not share your SMS opt-in data and consent with external third parties for their own marketing purposes without your express consent.

_In Aggregate or De-Identified Form._ We use information collected through this Site to create a compiled, aggregate view of usage patterns. We may share aggregate information with third parties so they can better understand our user base. We may also share, with third parties, information about how particular individuals use this Site, but only on a de-identified basis (“Individualized Data”). Individualized Data is not personally identifiable, but it does reflect the usage patterns of a particular Site user, as opposed to Site users collectively.

_As Part of a Business Transfer_. Your information may be transferred to successor organization if, for example, we transfer the ownership or operation of this Site to another organization or if we merge with another organization or liquidate our assets. If such a transfer occurs, the successor organization’s use of your information will still be subject to this Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

_To Comply with Laws and Protect Our Rights and the Rights of Others_. We may disclose your information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose your information to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to protect the security of this Site; to enforce or apply our online [Terms of Use](https://www.neighborly.com/terms-of-use) or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others.

_As Described in a Privacy Notice or Click-Through Agreement._ We reserve the right to disclose your information as described in any Privacy Notice posted on a page of this Site where you provide that information. By providing your information on that page you will be consenting to the disclosure of your information as described in that privacy notice. We also reserve the right to disclose your information as described in any click–through agreement to which you have agreed.
