By using or accessing the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 12 below.

There may be instances when we offer additional terms specific to a product, application, or service, which are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use. To the extent such additional terms conflict with these Terms of Use, the additional terms associated with the product, application, or service, with respect to your use of the product, application or service, will prevail.

References to “us,” “we,” and “our” mean Atypon. References to “you” and “user” are used to mean anyone who is using or accessing the Services.
