When sharing your Personal Data with other Binance entities, we will use our best endeavours to ensure that such entities are either subject to this Privacy Notice, or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

* Affiliates: Personal data that we process and collect may be transferred between Binance companies as a normal part of conducting business and offering our Services to you. See Section 1 “Binance Relationship with you” and Section 2. “What Personal Data does Binance collect and process?”.

The third-party service providers only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protection laws.

_Third Party Independent Controllers_

Within the context of the services rendered by Binance, some of the third party service providers may process your personal data as independent data controllers for their own purposes which may include but are not limited to:

\- compliance with legal or regulatory obligations under applicable laws;

\- prevention of criminal activity, fraud (including impersonation fraud), money laundering or other illicit activities by checking data against records of confirmed or suspected illegal activities; in connection with this purpose, the service provider may carry out profiling, statistical analysis and analytics in AML/CFT tendency using machine learning

\- enhancing the effectiveness and quality of its fraud prevention services;

\- user onboarding as the third party’s own client or customer;

\- user identification necessary to respond to data subject requests;

\- establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (if applicable).

The service providers rely on legal bases for data processing as disclosed in their respective privacy notices, accessible from their websites. Your personal data will be processed no longer than necessary for the above processing purposes and will be retained according to the service providers’ retention schedules. You can request for more information about the identity of the third party service providers and their processing activities by contacting Binance (see Section 10). 

* Legal Authorities or Legal requirements: We may share your information with courts, law enforcement authorities, regulators, attorneys or other third parties: (a) to comply with laws and legal obligations; (b) for the establishment, exercise, or defence of a legal or equitable claim; (c) to respond to law enforcement and regulatory requests, including (1) when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, search or seizure warrant, or similar legal procedure, or (2) for international law enforcement requests, pursuant to a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) or letters of request; (d) to comply with one or more forms of “travel rules” that require our transmitting of your information to another financial institution, regulatory authorities or other industry partners; (e) when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of our customers, Binance, or others, including to prevent imminent physical harm or material financial loss; (f) to investigate violations of our Terms of Use or other applicable policies; or (g) to detect, investigate, prevent or address fraud or credit risk, other illegal activity or security and technical issues, to report suspected illegal activity or to assist law enforcement in the investigation of suspected illegal or wrongful activity.

In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Binance or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, user information will be one of the transferred assets.
    
* With your Consent: We also may disclose your Personal Data as may be described in a notice to you at the time the information is collected or before it is shared, or in any other manner to which you consent.

We also rely on decisions from the European Commission where they recognise that certain countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area ensure an adequate level of protection for personal information. These decisions are referred to as “adequacy decisions”.
