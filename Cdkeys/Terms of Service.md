We do our best to provide a refund where possible, but please note that games that have been played or keys that have been redeemed are ineligible for a refund. Refund requests have to be submitted within 7 days of the delivery of the key by the Vendor to the Purchaser or Customer.

8.7 If a purchase has been made through Crypto and exceeds 90 days or has been made through other available payment methods (PayPal, Checkout, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.) and exceeds 120 days, we will be unable to refund back to the original payment method, as per the payment processor’s capabilities. We may be able to refund the value in gift card or CDKoins. This is only providing all other terms and conditions are met, and the refund is accepted.

8.8 The buyer acknowledges they are of appropriate age both for the game and its content, and have the authorisation of the card holder (or payment method) to make the purchase.
