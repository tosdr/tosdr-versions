8.5 Buyers agree and acknowledge that CDKeys.com has the right to delay or decline purchases of any Program for any reason. Limits may apply to the amount and number of Programs you can buy through the Online Shop. 

8.6 We offer refunds on a discretionary basis, and each refund request is looked at individually. We do our best to provide a refund where possible, but please note that games that have been played or keys that have been redeemed are ineligible for a refund. Refund requests have to be submitted within 7 days of the delivery of the key by the Vendor to the Purchaser or Customer.

8.7 If a purchase has been made through Crypto and exceeds 90 days or has been made through other available payment methods (PayPal, Checkout, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.) and exceeds 120 days, we will be unable to refund back to the original payment method, as per the payment processor’s capabilities. We may be able to refund the value in gift card or CDKoins. This is only providing all other terms and conditions are met, and the refund is accepted.

8.8 The buyer acknowledges they are of appropriate age both for the game and its content, and have the authorisation of the card holder (or payment method) to make the purchase.

If you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, please get in touch with us by logging a support ticket at support.cdkeys.com.

  
**9\. Pre-Orders**

9.2 Although CDKeys.com shall use its best endeavours to deliver the CD keys for the pre-ordered Program prior to the official release date indicated on the Online Shop, CDKeys.com does not guarantee that the CD keys for the pre-ordered Program shall be delivered prior to the official release date.

CDKeys.com may only guarantee the delivery of the CD keys that it receives from the Sellers.

9.3 Buyers acknowledge that the price of the pre-ordered Program may vary from time to time. Buyers further acknowledge that the sale of the pre-ordered Program may be revoked for any reason, in which case the Program Price paid for the pre-ordered Program shall be reimbursed by the Seller.

9.4 Where a purchase has been made through Crypto and exceeds 90 days or has been made through other available payment methods (PayPal, Checkout, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.) and exceeds 120 days, we will be unable to refund back to the original payment method, as per the payment processor’s capabilities. We may be able to refund the value in gift card or CDKoins. This is only providing all other terms and conditions are met, and the refund is accepted.

9.5 Where possible, CDKeys.com will try to ensure that any pre-order bonus content is included within the product if mentioned on the product description page. However, there may be occasions when the bonus content is only available while stocks last and is not always guaranteed. Customers who pre-ordered are advised to regularly check their orders page to ensure they receive the bonus content as soon as the keys become available.
