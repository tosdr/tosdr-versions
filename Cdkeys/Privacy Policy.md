Privacy Policy
==============

     

Compliance
----------

CDK LLC (‚Äú**CDKeys.com**‚Äù, ‚Äú**we**‚Äù, ‚Äú**us**‚Äù, ‚Äú**our**‚Äù) is committed to respecting privacy and data protection compliance.

This privacy policy together with Appendix A (‚Äú**Privacy Policy**‚Äù) sets out how and why we collect, store, use, transfer and disclose your personal data (also referred to as personal information in this Privacy Policy) and how you may access your personal information and correct it. This Privacy Policy also explains the use of cookies on our Site. For the avoidance of doubt, ‚Äú**personal data**‚Äù or ‚Äú**personal information**‚Äù means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, photo, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, birthday, office location, professional and personal interests, company name, title department, and spoken languages) or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. ‚Äú**Site‚Äù** means [https://www.cdkeys.com/](https://www.cdkeys.com/) and all subpages and subdomains related to [https://www.cdkeys.com/](https://www.cdkeys.com/) and any additional website domains as determined by CDKeys.com from time to time. **‚ÄùUser‚Äù**, ‚Äú**you**‚Äù and ‚Äú**your**‚Äù collectively mean the person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Site. A user may be a visitor of CDKeys.com or an Account holder. ‚Äú**Account**‚Äù means the account that users may create through the Site.

For the purposes of the data processing and control, the relevant legal entity is CDKeys.com. Our contact email address for any communications regarding your personal data is [\[email¬†protected\]](https://www.cdkeys.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) (please include ‚Äúpersonal data‚Äù in the email subject).

**GDPR**

If you are a resident of the European Union, you are protected by, and enjoy additional, rights under the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, also known as GDPR.

Changes to Privacy Policy
-------------------------

We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and at our sole discretion. Although we will use our best endeavours to notify you of any amendment to this Privacy Policy, we will not be required to provide you with prior notification of such amendments or changes to this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to frequently check our Site for any changes to our Privacy Policy.

Your continued use of our Site, services, requesting our assistance or the provision of further personal information to us (directly or via an authorised person) after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

### **What data do we collect?**

Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

We collect non-personally identifying information to better understand how our visitors use our Site. The information collected will also help us troubleshoot problems, analyse our resources and improve our services and/or products. There is nothing in that kind of information that could enable anyone to identify who you are.

We also collect potentially personal information including:

* your name
* your contact information including your email address
* your demographic information including preferences and interests
* other information relevant to customer surveys and/or offers
* Internet Protocol(**IP‚Äù**) addresses
* cookies. For the complete list of cookies we collect see the [List of cookies we collect](https://www.cdkeys.com/privacy-policy#list) section.

### **How do we collect personal data?**

We collect personal information in a number of ways, including:

* when you or a third-party contact us independently of our Site, such as by email, phone or in person
* when you visit and interact with our Site and related software (including any mobile applications)
* when you engage in transactions with us
* when you sign up for an Account with CDKeys.com or become a part of the CDKeys.com affiliate programme
* through cookies and other technologies that allow us to give you a better experience on our Site
* when you contact us via our Site or sign up for our newsletter/mailing list

In each case, we collect such personal information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of your interaction with us. We do not disclose personal information other than as described below in this Privacy Policy.

You may refuse to supply personal information, however this may prevent you from engaging in certain Site-related activities and we may not be able to provide our services and/or products or assistance to you or on your behalf.

You must not provide us with the personal information about another person unless you have first obtained that person's prior consent to do so and you have told them their personal information will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy (including where to find it). By providing us with information about any third party individual, you hereby warrant and represent that you have all necessary consents and permissions to do so, and that you can provide proof of the same to us.

We will not sell, distribute or lend access to your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you have given us permission for this to happen.

If you have previously given us permission to use your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to us at [\[email¬†protected\]](https://www.cdkeys.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Cookies
-------

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our Site in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes, after which the data is removed from the system.

Cookies help us to provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. You should note that this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site and its associated services.

We do or may use the following cookies:

* Strictly necessary cookies.These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Site. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Site, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.
* Analytical/performance cookies.They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Site works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
* Functionality cookies.These are used to recognise you when you return to our Site. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* Targeting cookies.These cookies record your visit to our Site, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our Site and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.

Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.

If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer you should set your browsers to refuse cookies before using our Site, with the drawback that certain features of our Site may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**APPENDIX A**

**ALTERNATIVE CLAUSES/ADDITIONAL CLAUSES**

**1.More detailed background on data collection**

Information we collect, and how we do it
========================================

We collect information, both general and personal, in a number of ways, as detailed in this Privacy Policy. In the case of personal or personally-identifiable information, we collect information only insofar as it is, and remains, necessary to fulfil the purpose of your interaction with us. We collect and store information using a number of technologies such as cookies, caches, databases, and logs. We do not use or disclose personal information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.

You may refuse to provide us with personal information, and you may object to our collection of information; however, this may impact your ability to use or benefit from our Site, platforms, apps, products, and/or services, and our ability to provide you with support or assistance.

Information you provide, content you create, and files you upload
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When you create an Account on our Site and other affiliated platforms, including any mobile applications, you provide us with personal information that includes your name, email address, phone number, and a password.

Even if you do not create an Account, you may opt to provide us with personal information for specific purposes. For instance, you may provide us with an email address to receive marketing material or updates about our services or a phone number so that we may call you back about a customer inquiry.

We also collect content that you create, upload, or receive from others when using our Site and other platforms. This includes comments as well as orders, invoices, sites and documents you generate.

Information we collect about your browser and devices
-----------------------------------------------------

While you use our Site and other platforms, we collect general information of the sort that web browsers, servers and network operators typically make available, such as unique identifiers (e.g. persistent cookies, MAC addresses, device IDs, IMEI numbers), browser type and settings, location data, device type and settings, operating system, IP address, mobile network information including operator name and phone number and application version number, language preferences, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time and referral URL of each visitor request. This information helps us to troubleshoot problems, understand how visitors use our Site, allocate and balance resources, and improve our products and services.

Some of this information could be personal data, i.e. data that is personally-identifiable (that is they could be used to directly or indirectly identify you as an individual and natural person)‚Äîinformation like IP addresses, phone numbers, and unique identifiers. We treat such information in the same way that we treat all other personal information (such as your name), and will only use and disclose such personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Information we collect about how you use our Site and services
--------------------------------------------------------------

As you use our Site and services, we collect information about how you interact with our platform and how you use our services, such as the links that you click, content that you view, terms, products, and services that you search for, products that you buy, people you communicate, or share information, with, and how you interact with advertisements.

We collect information about your activity to understand how you use and interact with our Site, other platforms, our products and services. This helps us understand customer preferences, optimise our Site and other platforms, allocate and balance resources, and improve our products and services.

How we use the information we collect
=====================================

We collect information to enable you to receive the benefit of our Site, platforms, apps, products, and services. Subject to this Privacy Policy, and your data preferences, we may use the information we collect for some or all of the following purposes:

* carry out our obligations and to provide you with agreed products and services
* establish, maintain and administer your Account (including the facilitation of payments)
* maintain, troubleshoot, and improve our Site, platforms, apps, products, and services
* develop new products and services
* if your preferences permit, to provide you with recommendations and personalised products and services
* measure performance of our Site, platforms, apps, products, and services
* secure and protect you, us, our Site, platforms, apps, products, and services, and the public
