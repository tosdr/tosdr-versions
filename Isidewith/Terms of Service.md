The arbitrator will apply the law specified in Section 14 to the merits of any dispute or claim. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties to the arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator may grant permanent injunctions or other relief in such dispute or claim; provided that the arbitrator may not grant licenses to any intellectual property owned by either party nor may the arbitrator award punitive damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without breach of this arbitration provision either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to collect amounts due, for temporary injunctive relief, or to enforce such party's intellectual property rights.

### 13\. Attorney’s Fees

### 14\. Choice of Law; Severability; Waiver; Entire Agreement; Assignment

These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without application of the conflict of law principles thereof. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms shall not be affected or impaired thereby. No waiver by either party of the breach of these Terms will be valid or binding unless made in writing and signed by the party prejudiced thereby. These Terms constitute the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements concerning such subject matter.
