The Services are owned and operated by Choozle, Inc., DBA Choozle (“**Choozle**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”). You, the reader (“**Company**”, “**you**”, “**your**”)  should read these Terms of Service carefully before using the Services.

BY USING OR ACCESSING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND ALL TERMS, POLICIES, AND GUIDELINES INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CHOOZLE’S PRIVACY POLICY ([HTTPS://CHOOZLE.COM/PRIVACY-POLICY](https://choozle.com/PRIVACY-POLICY)). THESE TERMS OF SERVICE ARE LEGALLY BINDING AND CONDITIONS YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you may not use the Services.

1. **ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND ACCESS**

To register for the Choozle Platform and create an “**Organization Account**” for your organization, you (including any agent designated by you operating on your behalf) must complete the registration process by providing Choozle with the information prompted by the registration form, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, telephone, Company name, Company website, and password. After you create your Organization Account, you may create subsequent “**User Accounts**” for each of your clients (Organization Account and User Accounts are referred to herein as “**Account(s)**”). You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for the Choozle Platform, and to keep such information up to date.

You shall protect your username and password and are solely responsible for activities that occur under or through your Account(s), including activities initiated by third parties, whether or not you authorize such activities. If you allow a third party to access the Choozle Platform on your behalf, you shall ensure that such third party is bound by, and abides by, these Terms of Service, and any applicable Master Services Agreement (“**MSA**”) or Order Form, Statement of Work, or Insertion Order (“**SOW**”). You solely are responsible for any activity on your Account(s). You agree to notify Choozle immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account(s) or any other breach of security relating to your Account(s) or your use of the Choozle Platform. You may only use the Services for your internal business purposes.

Choozle may access your Account(s), or information associated with your Account(s), to provide support or maintenance, for security-related reasons, or any other business purpose. You acknowledge and consent to such access.

2. **FEES**

2.1  **Subscription Plans and Additional Services**

Choozle offers monthly subscription plans (the “**Subscription Plans**”) with optional add-ons that can be purchased.

Additional fees may be outlined in any applicable MSA and SOW(s). You agree to pay all fees incurred by you in using the Choozle Services.

2.2 **Changes in Fees**

We may, upon any notice required by applicable law, change the fees for the Choozle Platform at any time or impose additional fees or charges. Such fee changes will be effective only as to prospective Choozle Platform orders (including monthly, automatic renewals and Subscription Plan upgrades) after the effective date of such change.

2.3 **Subscription Plan Fees**

During the registration process, you will enter your required details to create your Organization Account and subsequent User Accounts. A credit card is required to activate your subscription and ensure you have continued access to your Account(s) and the Platform. The Subscription Plan will be charged to the card on file for the Organization Account.

After your first month or usage, your Subscription Plan will automatically renew at the first of the following month and you will be charged the full amount of your subscription. Your Subscription Plan will renew automatically and continue month-to-month at the rate you agreed to unless you cancel your Subscription Plan or we terminate it, in each case pursuant to these Terms of Service (see Section 2.7 (‘Account Cancellation’) and Section 12 (‘Term and Termination’)). You must cancel your Subscription Plan before it renews to stop recurring charges. We will bill the fees due under your Subscription Plan to the credit card you provide us during registration (or to a different credit card if you change your payment information) and continue to do so month-to-month at the rate you agreed to as set forth herein. The fees for your Subscription Plan and add-ons are billed in advance of each billing cycle and are non-refundable. You acknowledge that the amount billed for each renewal period may vary due to promotional offers, changes in your Subscription Plan, add-ons, or applicable taxes, and you authorize us to bill you the corresponding amounts. No refunds or credits or rollovers will be provided for partial months of the Choozle Platform, upgrades and downgrades, or for months unused with an open Account(s). Any discounts applied to a previous Subscription Plan will not apply to a renewed Subscription Plan, including automatic renewals.

As an express condition of your use of and access to the Choozle Platform, you agree to pay all fees applicable to your Subscription Plan, any other fees for additional services you may purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Choozle Platform. We reserve the right to deactivate your access to the Choozle Platform for failure to pay applicable fees as described in these Terms of Service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are payable in U.S. Dollars.

2.4 **Credit Card Payments**

All fees for your Subscription Plan and any add-ons will be billed to your credit card. You authorize us to charge your credit card for your Subscription Plan and all other fees incurred by you in using the Services including, without limitation the fees detailed in any applicable MSA or SOW(s) and you authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts described herein and authorize us (or a billing agent acting on our behalf) to continue charging all such amounts to your credit card account until you or we cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan as provided herein or these amounts are paid in full, whichever is later. You must provide current, complete, and accurate billing and credit card information. You must promptly update all billing information (such as billing address, card number, and expiration date) to keep your Account(s) current, complete, and accurate, and you must promptly contact Choozle if your credit card is lost or stolen, or if you become aware of a potential breach of Account(s) security (such as an unauthorized disclosure or use of your Choozle username or password). You authorize us to obtain or determine updated or replacement expiration dates for your credit card in the event that the credit card you provided us expires. We reserve the right to charge any renewal card issued to you to the same extent as the expired card. If payment is not received from your credit card issuer, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. If payment is not received as a result of an expired credit card, we reserve the right to cancel your Subscription Plan and or remove access to your Account(s). You agree to pay all costs of collection, including attorney’s fees and costs, and interest on any outstanding balance. In certain instances, the issuer of your credit card may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Please check with your bank and credit card issuer for details.

2.5 **Invoice Payment Terms**

Choozle may, in its sole discretion, offer you a line of credit. Choozle will use internal credit authorization practices such as running a credit check to determine if you are eligible for invoiced billing from a line of credit and, if so, use that credit check to determine the limit of the line of credit to be offered to you. If, after the credit check, Choozle determines you do not qualify for a line of credit, you will pay Choozle for the Services using a credit card as described in section 2.4. If approved, we will invoice you for fees pursuant to the spend calculated by the Choozle Platform and you will pay all fees hereunder within thirty (30) days after receipt of the applicable invoice. 

2.6 **Non-Payment**

If you fail to pay or there is an issue with your payment to us, upon ten (10) days prior written notice and your failure to cure, Choozle reserves the right (in addition to any other rights or remedies Choozle may have) to re-charge your credit card and to discontinue the Services and suspend your access to the Platform and Services if any fees are more than thirty (30) days overdue until such amounts are paid in full.  All payments must be made in U.S. dollars. Outstanding balances may, in Choozle’s discretion accrue interest at a rate equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month and the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, from the due date until paid, plus Company’s reasonable costs of collection (including attorney’s fees).  All fees due hereunder are exclusive of, and you shall pay, all sales, use and other taxes, export and import fees, customs duties, and similar charges applicable to the transactions contemplated by these Terms of Service, except for taxes based upon your net income.

2.7 **Adjusting Subscription Plans**

Questions involving upgrades or downgrades to your Subscription Plan can be directed to [help@choozle.com](mailto:help@choozle.com) or by submitting a ticket within the Choozle Support Center.

Any additional or alternative payment arrangements are in Choozle’s sole discretion.

2.8 **Account Cancellation**

You may cancel your Subscription Plan and any add-ons in the Platform by going to **Settings > ‘Request to Cancel Account’**. Otherwise, you may cancel your Subscription Plan and any add-ons by contacting [help@choozle.com](mailto:help@choozle.com) or by submitting a ticket within the Choozle Support Center and requesting a cancellation. You must cancel your Subscription Plan prior to the end of your current pre-paid period to avoid charges for the next billing cycle. If you cancel your Subscription Plan, you will lose all access, upon the expiration of your current pre-paid period, to the Choozle Platform and any data or information stored in your Account(s). See Section 12 (‘Term and Termination’) for additional details. Cancellation of your Subscription Plan automatically cancels any add-ons associated with that Subscription Plan. No refunds or credit will be given for any add-on canceled due to a canceled Subscription Plan. You may request a refund for any unused balances associated with your canceled Account(s) by emailing [help@choozle.com](mailto:help@choozle.com).

2.9 **Media Fees**

If elected to in the MSA, you shall have access to the Choozle advertising planning and buying campaign tool (“**Campaign Tool**”) in the Platform. By utilizing the Campaign Tool, you will incur incremental fees that are comprised of, but not limited to, your Account(s) balance, media costs, data targeting costs, ad serving costs, third-party tool costs, and optimization costs that drive the execution of campaigns (“**Media Fees**”). These Media Fees will be set forth on the Platform. You agree to pay any media or campaign fees for campaigns selected by you.

You will obtain and hereby grant to Choozle, all rights, and permissions needed to authorize Choozle to buy inventory on your behalf (and any third party on whose behalf you are acting), perform tracking, and analytics, and to store and serve ads. During the Term, Choozle may offer additional services beyond those described herein. Fees for such services will be shown in the Platform user interface. In addition, to the extent that you request Choozle’s help to manage campaigns or to use the Services, whether such requests are verbal or in writing, you consent to the actions that Choozle performs on your behalf and will pay any additional fees as set forth in the Platform. You retain sole responsibility for such assisted use of the Services.

If you authorize Choozle to manage campaigns on your behalf through the Platform, Choozle will charge an increased fee on your media. The current fee for managed campaign services is ten percent (10%) but is subject to change upon notice from Choozle.

All Media Fees are paid via credit card. At User Account creation, you must add a credit card and prepay an initial amount, to be set by Choozle and you, (the “**Initial Charge**”) to each User Account created (“**User Account Balance**”). Media Fees will be charged to the credit card on file for the User Account(s). As you accrue campaign spend, Choozle will automatically deduct the spend from your User Account Balance. You agree to permit Choozle to charge your credit card to refill your User Account Balance (the “**Ongoing Charges**”). The Ongoing Charges, at your election, may be automatically or manually charged. If you elect automatic refilling (“**Auto-Refill**”) of your User Account Balance, Choozle will charge the credit card on file for each User Account when the User Account Balance reaches a preset minimum account balance (your “**Minimum Balance**”). We recommend a Minimum Balance of no less than five hundred dollars ($500). Auto-Refill is on by default. At your discretion, you may turn off Auto-Refill and manually add funds to your User Account (“**Manual-Refill**”). If you elect Manual-Refill, you add money to your Prepaid Balance ad hoc. If the User Account Balance is insufficient to run campaigns, the ability to run campaigns will be suspended. If your User Account Balance drops below zero dollars ($0), you agree to permit Choozle to automatically charge your credit card the amount owed to Choozle, bringing your User Account Balance back to zero dollars ($0). If your User Account Balance remains below the Minimum Balance for longer than twenty four (24) hours, all campaigns under the Account will be disabled until the User Account Balance is funded. You may manually add funds to your User Account even if you have set your User Account to Auto-Refill. All amounts due or payable hereunder are in US dollars. Media Fees and campaign expenses for all media or ads that have already been placed are noncancellable and nonrefundable.

2.10 **Creatives**

We may, upon any notice required by applicable law, change the fees for the Choozle Platform at any time or impose additional fees or charges. Such fee changes will be effective only as to prospective Choozle Platform orders (including monthly, automatic renewals and Subscription Plan upgrades) after the effective date of such change.

Choozle hereby grants you a royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to any Choozle Materials to the extent incorporated in, combined with, or otherwise necessary for the use of the Deliverables for any and all purposes.

2.10.2.2 **Approvals.** 

Any approvals required in an SOW must be received in accordance with mutually agreed upon production timelines as detailed in an SOW. Your failure to provide timely approvals may result in extended project timelines, missed deadlines, and/or overages.

2.10.2.3 **Product Delivery.**

Choozle shall be excused from performance hereunder to the extent that performance is prevented, delayed or obstructed by causes beyond its reasonable control.

14.2 **Severability and Waiver**

For the sake of clarity, controversies, allegations or claims arising out of the Website do not constitute a Dispute for which arbitration is a permitted dispute resolution option. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in Denver, Colorado. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocates of their choosing. You and Choozle will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Choozle to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 15.3 to be enforceable, then Choozle will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.

In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor these Terms of Service and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys’ fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION: (i) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY; (ii) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES; AND (iii) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER; THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief**

The foregoing provisions of Section 15.3 will not apply to any (i) legal action taken by you or Choozle to seek an injunction or other equitable relief or (ii) controversy, allegation, or claim that arises out of relates to your or Choozle’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights.
