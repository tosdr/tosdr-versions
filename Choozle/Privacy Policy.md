#####   
**ADVERTISING SERVICES PLATFORM PRIVACY NOTICE AND OPT-OUT INFORMATION**

Choozle provides a digital advertising software platform that leverages detailed consumer data to power programmatic advertising campaigns across display, video, mobile, audio, connected tv, digital out-of-home, and other mediums. Our service allows our clients to collect information about their current or potential customers using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, web bugs, televisions or OTT devices, and other collection technologies. While we do not collect this information on our site, we want you to be aware of how our services can be used to collect your information using publically available data and other collection technologies.  
   
[back to top](#backtotop)

#####   
**INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES PLATFORM**

Information collected through our service: We and our clients collect, organize, and use information reflecting your interactions with a variety of websites, media types and social networks. _This information may include items such as;_

* the date and time you visited a website;
* your browser information;
* your IP address
* your precise location data (with mobile operating system consent);
* your TV/CTV/OTT viewing behavior;
* your browsing behavior;
* your age and gender;
* any interests you express or imply at social networking sites or other websites you visit.

   
Choozle or its clients may recognize your computer over time by setting a unique browser cookie or receive a mobile advertising or device ID from your operating system, which your browser or operating system relays to our servers when you visit websites or apps that are affiliated with our partners or clients. We and our clients may also supplement the information we collect with additional information we obtain from other companies, which may include information derived from personal information prior to its use. We analyze the information we collect or obtain from third parties and organize it into pseudonymous user profiles, groups, and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests, offline and online actions.

The behavioral categories we use to customize the ads you may see or for related purposes do not use personally identifiable information (PII) that directly identifies you such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number. Our technology and services are designed to limit our use of consumer data to pseudonymous or non-personal information.

**Information provided by clients or third parties:** Our clients and/or third parties may provide us with various data sets that typically reside within their customer relationship management databases, which may include;

(a)Contact information such as names, emails, addresses, or phone numbers.

(b)Location information, such as zip code or the approximate geographic area derived from your IP address or location positioning information provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile device when location services have been enabled.

(c)Pseudonymous matched or linked data that enables our clients to match users across channels. The matched or linked data comes from third party data providers, brands, and websites with the rights to share consumer data for marketing purposes. We combine and measure these data sets against each other to ensure a high level of accuracy.

Please note that we license Choozle to third parties, such as website publishers, advertising agencies and marketers. A third-party licensee using Choozle may elect to collect, manage, and use other types of data through Choozle, which may include personal information (where permissible). Please consult the privacy policies of the websites you visit to become familiar with their privacy practices.  
   
[back to top](#backtotop)

#####   
**HOW OUR ADVERTISING SERVICES USE COLLECTED INFORMATION**

We and our clients and partners design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content across digital channels. We and our clients may also use this data for related purposes such as to conduct research regarding the results of our online advertising campaigns or to better understand the interests or activities of website visitors.

As noted, we primarily use cookies and mobile advertising identifiers to facilitate relevant ads. In addition, we may work with match partner websites to send us unique identifiers that have been de-identified from an email address or other personal information using a hashing algorithm. We then search our database of client data to determine whether any of our clients is requesting to match data for that particular pseudonymous identifier. If a match occurs, we attempt to associate a cookie with that pseudonymous data and any other information we have matched about the identifier in order to serve the individual with relevant messages or advertisements.

We may also use this data for measurement purposes such as understanding how digital advertising impacts purchasing on their Site or other sales channels.

We may also help clients create an ‘identity graph’ by “matching” or “mapping” users together that they have already “seen” across multiple web and mobile platforms, on a pseudonymous basis. This identity graph may then be used to enable cross-platform or cross-device relevant advertising to the same, or similar, individuals.

**This collected data may be used for personalized Advertising or Ad Delivery and Reporting which is further defined under the NAI’s Viewed Content Advertising Guidance.** As required under the NAI Code, the Choozle discloses standard interest segments that are based on [health-related information or interests](https://www.thetradedesk.com/assets/general/HealthSegments_TTD-Website.pdf) and [political information or interests](https://www.thetradedesk.com/assets/general/NAI_PoliticalSegments2.pdf) that it makes available in the Platform where permitted by law and self-regulatory rules. This information is used in the personalization of advertising efforts. Choozle confirms that any data used or collected by Choozle and our partners is obtained from responsible sources that provide users with appropriate levels of notice and choice.
