ABM PARKING SERVICES (ABM) AUTOMATED

LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION (ALPR) USAGE AND PRIVACY POLICY

ABM is dedicated to ensuring the privacy and security of the information entrusted to us

by our customers. Certain parking facilities where we provide services may have

equipment installed which is designed to read our customers’ license plates upon entry,

exit or during the time their vehicles are parked at the property. The purpose of this policy

is to tell you, our customer, why this information is collected and what we do with it.



How Does ALPR Work?

An ALPR system works by taking a photo of a license plate and recording the location,

date and time of the photo, which is then saved electronically and temporarily stored. The

system can be used at any entry, exit, or at other locations within the parking facility. The

ALPR only captures the letters and numbers of a license plate and does not connect the

name of the owner of the vehicle with the license plate unless specifically authorized or

submitted by the owner of the vehicle.



Why Do We Use ALPR?



ABM manages or leases many parking facilities, but we do not own any parking facilities.

This means that, in many cases where an ALPR system may be used, we do not own but

only operate the ALPR system. The owner of the parking facility may be the one that owns

the system.



In cases where we do operate these types of systems, we use the system to make your

experience as a customer better by, among other things:



• Expediting your wait time when entering or exiting the parking facility;

• Ensuring that you do not pay an incorrect fee;

• Helping you find your vehicle;

• Preventing the wrong vehicles from parking in restricted parking stalls;

• Providing security, including cooperating with law enforcement when legally

required; and

• Obtaining information needed in connection with damage claims.



Do We Share Your License Plate Information?

We do not sell your information to third parties for marketing or any other purposes.



During the normal course of business, there are some parties who may get to see your

license plate information as part of their job to keep the system operating, temporarily store

your license information or because they own the parking facility at which you parked. We

may also provide certain information to law enforcement as part of an investigation or as

required by law. Information may also be shared as needed to respond to an emergency.

Here are the parties who may get to see your license plate information:

• ABM employees trained to manage the ALPR system

• The vendors who maintain the system and/or store your information

• The owner or manager of the parking facility

• Security personnel

• Law enforcement



Those parties we allow to use the system for the above reasons are given training on how

to use the system and are monitored by our employees when they use the system.

How Do We Secure Your License Plate Information?

ABM and the ALPR system vendors use different kinds of safeguards like physical access

controls, digital permission controls, and other technological, procedural, and operational

security measures to protect your license plate information from being released to or

tampered with by unauthorized third parties. In addition, ALPR system vendors regularly

check the system in order to ensure the accuracy of the system and confirm that no outside

party has accessed the system without permission. Testing is also performed to make

sure that information in the system is accurate.



Who Is Responsible For Ensuring ABM Complies With This Policy?



At each location where we use an ALPR system, our local Operations Manager or General

Manager is responsible for compliance with this policy.

How Long Is Your License Plate Information Kept?

This may vary depending on the location where you parked and the policy of the

parking facility’s owner, but ABM will not keep your information collected through

the system for more than ninety (90) days, unless required by law.

Will There Be Changes To This Policy?

This ALPR Usage and Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time. Any changes

to the policy will take effect upon posting and will apply to all ALPR system data

regardless of when it was collected, in accordance with applicable law. We will display

the “Last Updated” date above so you can check this policy for any recent update.
