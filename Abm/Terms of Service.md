#### 8\. By Providing Content, We Do Not Allow You to Use Our Servicemarks

The service marks and logos of ABM used and displayed on our Web site are our registered and unregistered trademarks. Nothing on this Web site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any of our trademarks without our written permission. Requests to use trademarks owned by other companies which may be mentioned on this Web site should be directed to such other companies. We aggressively enforce our intellectual property rights.

#### 9\. We Are Not Providing Investment Advice Nor Soliciting Offers

Nothing in this site constitutes investment advice, including our SEC filings. We provide investor relations materials for your convenience and information only. In addition, investor relations materials and our other Web site content are not offers to sell or solicitations of an offer to buy any security.

All investors should know that there are “ups” and “downs” in every business and stock. There are no guarantees about the future performance of the stock market or our stock. Before you invest in any security, you can protect yourself by being an educated investor. If you are interested in our stock, we recommend that, at a minimum, you read our latest annual report and 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports to the SEC over the past year. Our recent proxy statements for shareholder meetings also contain important information. It is also advisable to learn more about us and our industry through a variety of public materials.

Our recent annual reports, 10-K and 10-Q reports and other materials are accessible through this Web site. Other materials we have filed with the SEC are available through its Web site at [https://www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/). You can also visit the SEC at its Washington or various regional offices for the same information or hire a document retrieval service to obtain the filings for you.

#### 10\. You Should Not Rely on the Stock Price Information on Our Web Site

We do not generate the information regarding ABM’s stock prices for our Web site. We believe the information on the Stock Price Details page is accurate, but we cannot guarantee or warrant the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information. You should not rely on the stock price information for investment purposes. We are not liable for any loss or damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary, that arise from reliance on information on the Stock Price Details page.

#### 11\. Investors Should Not Rely on Forward-Looking Information

Some of the statements on our Web Site, including those relating to projected future financial performance or events, are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, specifically the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our expectations or forecasts of future events. Sometimes these statements will use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “outlook,” “forecast,” and other similar words. These statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual performance to be materially different from those we project.

Our actual results will be different due to the inherent nature of projections and may be better or worse than projected. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they initially were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to any forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, to reflect events or circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events after the date they initially were made.

In addition to the factors set forth in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following factors could affect the forward- looking statements: the ability to achieve or quantify savings for our clients or ourselves through our global cost-cutting program and other financial management programs; the ability to obtain, or the timing of obtaining, future government awards and contracts; the availability of government funding and client requirements; changes in government priorities due to program reviews or revisions to strategic objectives; difficulties in developing and producing operationally advanced technology systems; the competitive environment; economic, business and political conditions domestically and internationally; the timing and client acceptance of product deliveries and launches; the outcome of contingencies, including litigation, environmental remediation, program performance, and completion of any acquisitions and divestitures. These are only some of the numerous factors which may affect the forward-looking statements contained on our Web Site.

#### 12\. You Must Obey Local Laws in Accessing Our Web Site

This site is controlled by us from our offices within the United States of America. We make no representation that content or materials in the site are appropriate or available for use in other jurisdictions. If you choose to access this site from other jurisdictions, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws, including but not limited to the export and import regulations. We are not responsible for any law violations. You may not use or export the materials in this site in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

The materials on the ABM Web Site are subject to the United States Export Administration Laws and Regulations. Diversion of such materials contrary to United States law is prohibited. Neither the materials, nor any information acquired through the use of the ABM Web Site, may be acquired for, shipped, transferred, or re-exported, directly or indirectly, to proscribed or embargoed countries or their nationals, nor may it be used for nuclear activities, chemical biological weapons, or missile projects, unless specifically authorized by the United States Government for such purposes. You shall comply strictly with all United States export laws and assume sole responsibility for obtaining licenses to export or re-export as may be required.

By accessing this website, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless ABM, its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers and any third party information providers to us from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from any violation of these terms of use by you.

#### 15\. Third Parties May Have Rights Under This Agreement

Some of the provisions of these terms of use are for the benefit of ABM and its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, and suppliers. Each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce those provisions directly against you on its own behalf.
