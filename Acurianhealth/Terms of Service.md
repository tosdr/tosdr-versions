### 9\. TERMINATION

Acurian reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately modify, suspend or terminate Services and/or your access to some or all of them with or without cause and without notice.

### 10\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

YOU UNDERSTAND AND EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT:

YOUR USE OF ANY SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. ACURIAN DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REPRESENTATIONS AND CONDITIONS OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OF USE AND WITHOUT LIMITATION DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS IMPLIED BY LAW, CONVENTION, COURSE OF DEALING OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ACURIAN MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT ACURIAN SITES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT ACURIAN SITES WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR IN A TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE MANNER, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE FROM OR PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES. ACURIAN IS NOT ENGAGED IN RENDERING LEGAL, MEDICAL, COUNSELING OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OR ADVICE. ACURIAN ENCOURAGES YOU TO SEEK APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE OR CARE FOR ANY SITUATION OR PROBLEM THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

### 11\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

ACURIAN SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT. ACURIAN SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES RESULTING FROM (A) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OR THE CONTENT INCLUDED IN, THE SERVICES; (B) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; OR (C) ANY BREACH OF THESE TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLES, EVEN IF ACURIAN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you. In such states or jurisdictions, Acurian’s liability is excluded or, to the extent exclusion of liability for the relevant liability is not permitted in such state or jurisdiction, limited to the maximum extent permitted by law, thereby minimizing Acurian’s liability to you to the lowest amount permitted by applicable law.

### 12\. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to indemnify and hold each of Acurian, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors and employees, and any third parties providing content included in the Services, harmless from any claim or demand (including, but not limited to, reasonable legal fees) made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Services.

### 13\. ASSIGNMENT

Acurian expressly reserves the right to transfer its rights and obligations under these Terms of Use, in part or as a whole, to: (i) another legal entity as part of any sale or merger of all or part of Acurian, Inc. with a separate legal entity; or (ii) an affiliate of Acurian.

### 14\. APPLICABLE LAW

These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of North Carolina, excluding its conflict of laws provisions. Any action to enforce these Terms of Use will be brought in the federal or state courts in and for the state of North Carolina, and all parties to these Terms of Use expressly agree to be subject to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

### 15\. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

A. Arbitration Agreement

_Any dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of Acurian’s Services, Sites, or Resources, or relating in any way to Acurian’s communications with you, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration._

This mandatory Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Acurian; however, it does not govern any Claim for personal injuries that you allege against a healthcare provider or product manufacturer, nor does it bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. This Arbitration Agreement also does not bar Acurian from seeking injunctive relief in any court to preliminarily enjoin your infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, or any of the Services or Resources that we allege in good faith violates these Terms of use.

Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal

Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Acurian are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a Class Action. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive any termination of these Terms of Use.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Acurian, Inc., 929 N Front St, Wilmington, NC 28401. If you are an individual, the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.

The number of arbitrators shall be one. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language in the city of Wilmington, North Carolina. North Carolina law shall apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video or based on written submissions.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the clause below entitled “Class Action Waiver.”

B. Class Action Waiver

Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.

Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If this Class Action Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.

### 16\. WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY

No waiver of by Acurian of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Acurian to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent necessary such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

### 17\. MISCELLANEOUS

If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be excluded from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms of Use are the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and Acurian concerning the Services. They replace and supersede any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreement and any other communications between you and Acurian.
