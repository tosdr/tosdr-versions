Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

* **Usage Data**

Tracking Technologies and Cookies
---------------------------------

_(We don’t use any of these but here is information [about them](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/)_ and additional [privacy information](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy) and [how to remove them.](https://privacybadger.org/#What-is-Privacy-Badger))

Privacy Self-Defense
--------------------

By disabling JavaScript will minimally impact the appearance of this website and by disabling JavaScript you significantly decrease trends analysis and presence in advertising databases. The EFF covers how to defend against browser fingerprinting and other [privacy self-defense](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/self-defense) techniques.

Use Tor
-------

In addition to the publishing of this website on the open internet, this site is also published on Tor, Gemini, I2P, and other locations. You can find these locations in the footer and use them to protect your privacy.

### Trust, but verify.

You can confirm that no tracking technologies are used by looking at “Storage” in the Web Developer tools. Additionally, only one tiny script is run, and that is to update the year in the footer.

### Cookies

Cookies and similar tracking technologies are used to track the activity on Our Service and store certain information. Tracking technologies used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and improve and analyze Our Service. The technologies We use may include:

* **Cookies or Browser Cookies.** A cookie is a small file placed on Your Device. You can instruct Your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a cookie is sent. However, if You do not accept Cookies, You may not be able to use some parts of our Service. Unless you have adjusted Your browser setting to refuse cookies, our Service may use Cookies.

Cookies can be “Persistent” or “Session” Cookies. Persistent Cookies remain on Your personal computer or mobile device when You go offline, while Session Cookies are deleted as soon as You close Your web browser.

### Supercookies

* **Flash Cookies**. Certain features of our Service may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about Your preferences or Your activity on our Service. Flash Cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as those used for Browser Cookies.
* **Local Shared Objects**. These are similar to Flask Cookies; there are four separate areas in the browser to store persistent data Cookies, Flash Objects or Flash Cookies (see above), the browser cache (see below), and LSO’s (Locally Shared Objects) that are typically in the form of SQLite Databases or other persistent in-browser storage locations. Another is a UIDH or Unique IDentifier Header that is added inline to your query by your ISP. We don’t read your UIDH or use any persistent storage.

### Beacons

* **Web Beacons**. Certain sections of our Service and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons, also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs. This beacon permits the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of a particular section and verifying system and server integrity).

_(We use none of the methods above;)_ if we did, it would be for the purposes set out below:

* **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    
    Type: Session Cookies
    
    Administered by: Us
    
    Purpose: These cookies are essential to provide You with services available through the Website and enable You to use some of its features. They help to authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services that You have asked for cannot be provided, and We only use these Cookies to provide You with those services.
    
* **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    
    Type: Persistent Cookies
    
    Administered by: Us
    
    Purpose: These Cookies identify if users have accepted the use of cookies on the Website.
    
* **Functionality Cookies**
    
    Type: Persistent Cookies
    
    Administered by: Us
    
    Purpose: These cookies allow us to remember choices You make when using the Website, such as remembering your login details or language preference. The purpose of these cookies is to provide You with a more personal experience and avoid You having to re-enter your preferences every time You use the Website.
    

### Analytics

* **Google Analytics.** You also load our analytics package that uses JavaScript to provide aggregated information in Google Analytics by loading our Website. It’s common to find this on a website, but we believe you’re more critical than a real-time spreadsheet.
    
* **Content Distribution Network.** This website lives in the cloud, via third parties we have relationships with, and every time you load this Website, you’re often pulling it from the a global CDN like Cloudflare, KeyCDN or BunnyCDN. BunnyCDN is our primary and is very privacy positive. KeyCDN is available to us as a backup network. Our service providers may use CloudFlare although we do not directly.
    
* **Twitter Website Tag** This domain, matthewjharmon.com and others, are listed in publications and social media presence such as Twitter. The Twitter website tag is a piece of Java Script that pulls the “universal website tag” from static.ads-twitter.com.

_(This is how we use Personal Data we don’t have.)_

The Company may use Personal Data for the following purposes:

Transfer of Your Personal Data
------------------------------

_(We don’t have your data, so we can’t transfer it.)_

Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company’s operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those from Your local authority.

### Law enforcement

Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

* **Protect and defend the rights** or property of the Company
* **Prevent or investigate** possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
