1\. Definitions  

a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other  preexisting works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of  music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance  and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be  recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the  original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an  Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the  Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work  in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for  the purpose of this License.  

b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias  and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or  subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the  selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which  the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other  contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which  together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will  not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.  

c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at  https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative  Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum,  because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and  effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the  relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this  License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements  as this License.  

d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work  or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.  e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by  Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.  f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work  under the terms of this License.

g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual,  individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be  identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors,  singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,  interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in  the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes  the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the  organization that transmits the broadcast.  

h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License  including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,  whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a  book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the  same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or  entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a  cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process  analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,  engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works  expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an  illustration, map, plan, sketch or three dimensional work relative to geography,  topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a  compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work  performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a  literary or artistic work.  

i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not  previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has  received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License  despite a previous violation.  

j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to  communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including  by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the  public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from  a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public  by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the  Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.  

k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without  limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing  fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in  digital form or other electronic medium.  

2\. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any  uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are  provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other  applicable laws.  

3\. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby  grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the  applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:  

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to  Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;  

b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any  translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or  otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a  translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to  Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";

c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections;  and,  

d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.  

e. For the avoidance of doubt:  

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the  right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme  cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such  royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;  

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the  right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme  can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties  for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,  

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,  whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a  collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,  from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. The above  rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or  hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such  

modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media  and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor  are hereby reserved.  

4\. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and  limited by the following restrictions:  

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License  with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or  impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the  recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of  the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that  refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work  You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work,  You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the  ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that  recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as  incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the  Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,  upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the  Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an  Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove  from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.  

b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this  License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this  License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license  version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,  AttributionShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you  license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply  with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of  the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply  with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You  must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each  Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any  terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability  of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under

the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to  the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work  as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You  Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective  technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the  Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of  the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in  a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to  be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.  

c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You  must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all  copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You  are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if  supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or  parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution  Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,  the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent  reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with  the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing  information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an  Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French  translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by  Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any  reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection,  at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the  Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least  as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of  doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of  attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this  License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,  sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution  Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express  prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.  

d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise  permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work  either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,  mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be  prejudicial to the Original Author’s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those  jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of  this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,  mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author’s  honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this  Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to  reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make  Adaptations) but not otherwise.  

5\. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer  

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,  LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,  STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,  WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER  DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,

WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW  THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT  APPLY TO YOU. 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY  APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY  LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE  OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF  THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  SUCH DAMAGES.  

7\. Termination  

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any  breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received  Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their  licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with  

those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for  the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,  Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop  distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not  serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,  granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and  effect unless terminated as stated above.  

8\. Miscellaneous  

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor  offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the  license granted to You under this License.  

b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the  recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the  license granted to You under this License.  

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall  not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,  and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be  reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and  enforceable.  

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented  to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be  charged with such waiver or consent.  

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the  Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with  respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional  provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be  modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.  

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were  drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary  and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of  1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms  Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).  These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the  License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of  the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the  standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional  rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included

in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under  applicable law.
