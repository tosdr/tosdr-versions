Changes to our End User Licence Agreements[](#)[](#)
====================================================

Last Modified on Wednesday, 29-May-2024 08:57:14 BST

Texthelp Ltd recently acquired LexAble and Claro. Two companies who share our belief that everyone has the right to understand and be understood. To learn more about the acquisition, [**please visit our main website**](https://www.texthelp.com/resources/blog/texthelp-acquires-the-lingit-group/).

This short article explains some changes being made to improve processes across the Texthelp Group.

**What is changing?**

The changes will not impact your experience. You will still be able to buy and use the same Texthelp products. 

We’re changing our operations to allow us to simplify areas such as ordering, contracting and payments. We’ve updated our End User Licence Agreements to reflect the new structure. 

You can view these for all products across the Group, [**here**](https://support.texthelp.com/help/end-user-license-agreements). 

**When will these changes happen?**

These changes will come into effect from 1st October 2021. If you have any questions, [**please get in touch.**](https://www.texthelp.com/contact/)
