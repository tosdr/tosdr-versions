----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix A:  Confidentiality statement for staff
================================================

When working for Texthelp , you will often need to have access to confidential information which may include, for example:

Personal information about individuals who are customers or users of Texthelp software.

Information about the internal business of Texthelp.

Personal information about colleagues working for Texthelp.

Texthelp  is committed to keeping this information confidential, in order to protect people and Texthelp.  ‘Confidential’ means that all access to information must be on a need to know and properly authorized basis.  You must use only the information you have been authorized to use, and for purposes that have been authorized.  You should also be aware that under the Data Protection Act, unauthorized access to data about individuals is a criminal offence.

You must assume that information is confidential unless you know that it is intended by Texthelp  to be made public.  Passing information between staff members in our international office, or between Texthelp  and a 3rd party marketing partner who is in compliance with our policy, or vice versa does not count as making it public, but passing information to another organization does count.

You must also be particularly careful not to disclose confidential information to unauthorized people or cause a breach of security.  In particular you must:

not compromise or seek to evade security measures (including computer passwords);

be particularly careful when sending information between our international offices;

not discuss confidential information, either with colleagues or people outside Texthelp;

not disclose information — especially over the telephone — unless you are sure that you know who you are disclosing it to, and that they are authorized to have it.

If you are in doubt about whether to disclose information or not, do not guess.  Withhold the information while you check with an appropriate person whether the disclosure is appropriate.

Your confidentiality obligations continue to apply indefinitely after you have stopped working for Texthelp .
