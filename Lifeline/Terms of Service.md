**Caution:** To reduce any risk of strangulation, Lifeline neck cords are designed to break apart under certain conditions. However, any cord worn around the neck can pose a strangulation risk, including the possibility of death and serious injuries. This may be of more concern to wearers in wheelchairs, using walkers, using beds with guardrails, or who might encounter other protruding objects upon which the cord can become tangled.
