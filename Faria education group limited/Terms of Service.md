----------------

**2.2.** Generally speaking, our services revolve around providing Members with online access to School information such as curriculum details, assessments & tasks, academic records, assessment submission & deadline dates, and other information, as well as acting as a communications medium to facilitate interaction between Teachers, IB Coordinators, Administrators, and Members.

Depending upon the preferences of the School and subject to the consent of Parents, students may be encouraged to make educational materials, results and grades available to third parties, such as Higher Education Institutions (i.e. Colleges & Universities) on one or more of the Websites. Further details are available on the Websites.

**2.4.** No information is shared on the IB Student Registry in respect to a Student without express Parental Consent, as defined below.

**3\. Account Terms: Child Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**3.1.** Informed Parental Consent. Before a Student of 13 years of age or less may use the Service or a School facilitates access to a Student (separately to a Parent), the Parent **MUST** provide a signed copy of the Form of Written Parental Consent **(“Parental Consent“)** to the school.

**3.4.** Indemnification.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, and in addition to any other indemnification mentioned in these Terms of Service, the School agrees to fully indemnify ManageBac on request and keep ManageBac indemnified on request with regard to any claim, if the suit involves claims arising directly or indirectly from failures to comply with this paragraph. The fact that a cause other than a failure to comply with the foregoing paragraph may have contributed to the harm alleged in such suit or proceeding will not in any way diminish the scope or force of this indemnification, even if such other cause is ManageBac’s own failure or negligence.

**4\. Payment Terms**
---------------------

**4.1.** The Service is provided on an annual basis. Schools are invoiced in advance on an annual basis for use of the Service, and Schools shall make payment to ManageBac net 30 days from the invoice date. The payments are in consideration of the creation, deletion, modification and maintenance of Members, and the license to use the Service. ManageBac will not pay any refund or credit if the School terminates or suspends use of the Service before the end of any prepaid period. Each payment is non-refundable.

**4.2.** Separate subscriptions are required for each of our Services. Pamoja Lesson Suite Services are additionally subject to the service specific terms and conditions held within the Admission Timeline and Fees document available [here](https://pamojaeducation.com/resource-library).

**4.3.** After the Initial Term, accounts are automatically renewed for successive periods (each a “Renewal Term”). The length of each Renewal Term is detailed in the Scope of Services Agreement, SOW, Services Agreement or Framework Agreement. In the absence of a signed agreement detailing the Initial Term, accounts are automatically renewed on an annual basis on the anniversary of the services start date as detailed on our invoice. Notice of termination must be received in writing 45 days in advance of the end of the then current term in order to terminate at the end of the current term. For the avoidance of doubt, the current term is the Initial Term, or any subsequent Renewal Term which has started.

**4.5.** Without prejudice to any other rights or remedy that it may have, if the School fails to pay ManageBac on the due date for payment of any undisputed invoice, ManageBac may:

(i) suspend all Services until payment has been made in full; and/or

The School is responsible for all travel expenses incurred for services indicated in this agreement in the event of cancellation for any reason. If travel to your location requires a flight greater than eight (8) hours, we reserve the right to come in a day early.

**4.11.** The pricing structure for Annual Service Fees for Recurring Services is based on student enrolment numbers. The fee for individual modules can change according to the student enrolment numbers. The School is requested to provide the current number of enrolled students by programme on an annual basis in order to calculate the fees for the following year. ManageBac reserves the right to increase the price of Annual Service Fees each year, however any increase that is due to changes to pricing, and not related to student enrolment numbers, will be limited to 5% or less per annum. 

Where multi-year payments of 2-year or 3-year Annual Service Fees have been received in full, on or before the Services Start Date, any changes to Services’ pricing structure will not be applied during this 2-year or 3-year period, as applicable.

**5\. Cancellation and Termination**
