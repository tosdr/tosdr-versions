Privacy Policy
==============

The safety of our customer’s personal data/information is the top priority to us. In the following paragraphs, we will explain to you about how we process your personal data and the Rights & Entitlements you have under our data protection regulations. We are always at your disposal for any complaints, questions or suggestions about data protection.

Data are strictly controlled by:
--------------------------------

WINROAD HOLDINGS LIMITED,

LEVEL 54, HOPEWELL CENTRE

183 QUEEN’S ROAD EAST, HK.

1\. How do we use uploaded data (images, videos)?
-------------------------------------------------

All uploaded images and videos are secure and will be dealt confidentially, data will be transferred with SSL/TLS- encrypted and only use them to perform requested image or video processing. A share or publish of information to any third parties are prohibited. Any uploaded images and videos, processed or non-processed will be deleted automatically. However, usage statistics (without images) will be stored for customer relationship purpose only in case you need to speak to us.

2\. How do we handle face data?
-------------------------------

* We use artificial intelligence technology to automatically create highly realistic facial transformations base on the portrait photos user uploaded.
* We use third-party cloud provider – specifically, Amazon Web Services – to process and edit photographs.
* Only the selected photos are uploaded to the cloud for editing.
* Photos are temporarily cached on the cloud servers during the editing process.
* Photos remain in the cloud for a very short period of 24-48 hours after you have last edited the photograph, so that you can access the image and make additional modifications if you choose to do so.
* We do not use the photos you provide for any reason other than to provide you with the portrait editing functionality.

3\. Server Logs:
----------------

There's NO personal data required for the visit/browsing of our webpage and/or App. However, our web servers will only collect the data provided by your own browser. Thus include:

* IP address
* Date, time
* Request context
* User ID
* URL
* The amount of data resented to you
* A message as to whether the request context was successful or failed
* Identification data of the browser and operating system being used
* Weblink from which the access was made

The legal basis for processing is based on our legitimate interest in ensuring system security, technical support and improvement of the service quality. These data may also be forwarded to the authorities should a hacking attack occurs. No other transmission to third parties takes place. All the server logs are stored for no longer than 3 months.
