5. **Payment and Renewal.**
    * **General Terms.**  
        Optional paid services such as extra monitors, extra seats, shorter monitor intervals, or extra SMS message / voice call credits are available on the products (any such service is considered an “Upgrade”). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay UptimeRobot the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-paid basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. In the case of standalone SMS message / voice call credit packages, there is a one-time pre-paid payment with the possibility of auto-refill to trigger when your credit balance gets low. For any plan upgrade, the payment method that you provided will be charged or credited the new prorated amount for the current payment period upon your request. You will be requested to pay the rate for the upgrade for the period from the date of the upgrade to the end of your current billing cycle. After successful confirmation of purchase, you will receive access to your new plan within a few minutes(depending on the speed of our payment processor). The new rate will apply to your next billing cycle. The proration amount displayed in the checkout area is calculated based on the seconds remaining in your current billing period. That’s why you may see a slightly different amount of proration in checkout compared to the actual billed amount. A downgrade in a plan will be scheduled for your usual renewal date, meaning your current plan will remain active until the end of your currently prepaid period. The new rate for your plan will apply and be charged on your next billing cycle. As an exception, if you downgrade your plan within 24 hours of expiration, the new plan will become active within a few minutes, without any proration applied. If the new plan does not fit the limits of your account resources (e.g. monitors and/or seats, etc) we reserve the right to deny a downgrade of your plan, or to suspend resources that do not fit the limit. In such cases you will be informed before this happens. UptimeRobot reserves the right to change the payment terms and fees.
    * **Minimal Hardware and Software Requirements for Using UptimeRobot.**  
        UptimeRobot can be used with any operating system (including mobile) that can run a modern browser (Edge, Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
    * **Purchase Process**  
        Services provided by UptimeRobot can be purchased through the "Upgrade link" that can be reached after logging in to the products. The process works as:

        * Complete the payment with a credit card or debit card
        * UptimeRobot sends an e-mail mentioning that the purchased service can be used

    * **Automatic Renewal.**
