You will not represent that you are any other individual or entity unless such individual or entity has given you written permission to act on their behalf.

Payment terms
-------------

The free trial offer entitles new, registered users to a fourteen-days (14) free trial of the Services.

Service fees are usually calculated on a per user per month basis, and charged monthly or yearly – depending on the Service Plan and other particulars of the subscription. The Customer shall ensure that sufficient funds are available on the relevant account and acknowledges that late payment may result in a suspension of the Service or a termination of the Agreement.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes or duties imposed by governing authorities. You are solely responsible for the payment of all such taxes or duties.

**Monthly plan**: A valid credit card is required for you to continue using the Services on a month-to-month basis after the free trial period ends (14 days). Services are billed in advance on a monthly basis and are non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months, for account upgrades or downgrades, or for months unused with an open account. Your account will automatically renew each month unless you change your subscription.

**Annual plan**: Payment in advance is required to continue using the Services on an annual basis after the free trial period ends (14 days). Services are billed in advance on a yearly basis. No refunds for partial use or the amount of time left in your subscription are offered unless otherwise explicitly agreed. Your account will automatically renew each year unless you change your subscription.

If you initially sign up for a paying account, and you do not cancel that account within 30 days, your credit card will be charged monthly starting on the 30th day after that account was initially created. If you cancel the Service prior to the processing of your first invoice on the 30th day, your credit card will not be charged.

Should you upgrade or downgrade your account type, your credit card will be charged with your new billing rate immediately. Your credit card will then be charged with your new billing rate every 30 days thereafter unless you cancel your account.

We reserve the right to change service fees at any time. We will give you thirty (30) days notice of any changes. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to our Website.

Cancellation and termination
----------------------------

You alone are responsible for the proper cancellation of your account. You may cancel your account at any time by clicking on the "Account" > "Billing" link in the Service’s navigation menu (or click [here](https://app.everhour.com/#/account/billing/settings)). There is a button to cancel your account. You cannot cancel your account via email or phone.

In the event of cancellation or termination we retain the right to retain or delete data provided to us by you at our sole discretion.

We also reserve the right to refuse service to anyone and close your account(s) without notice for any or no reason at all.

Indemnification
---------------

You agree to indemnify and hold us blameless from any and all demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees) made against us by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of Everhour.

Representations and warranties
------------------------------

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we provide Everhour on an “as is” and “as available” basis, which means we don’t provide warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and to any warranties that:

* Everhour will meet your specific requirements;
* Everhour will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free;
* The results that may be obtained from the use of Everhour will be accurate or reliable;
* The quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through Everhour will meet your expectations;
* Any errors in Everhour will be corrected.

Limitation of liability
-----------------------

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you assume full responsibility for and we disclaim liability to you for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if we had been advised of the possibility of such damages.

We disclaim any and all liability for the acts, omissions, and conduct of any third parties related to your use of Everhour and any linked sites and services. Your sole course of action against us regarding service dissatisfaction with Everhour is to stop using Everhour. This limitation of damages is a central part of our agreement. The preceding disclaimer applies to any damages, liability, or injuries whether for breach of contract, tort, negligence or any other course of action.

If, notwithstanding the other provisions of the Terms, we are found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Website or any of our Services, our liability shall not exceed what you paid us for the Services in the previous month. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.

Force majeure
-------------

You agree that we are not liable for any delays or failure in performance of any part of the Services, from any cause beyond our control.

Severability
------------

If one or more sections of the Terms are held unenforceable, then those sections will be removed or amended as little as necessary, so that the rest of the Terms will still be valid and enforceable.

Assignments
-----------

You may not assign any of your rights under this agreement to anyone else. We may assign our rights to any other individual or entity at our discretion.

No waiver
---------

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Entire agreement
----------------

These Terms and all documents incorporated into these Terms by reference constitute the entire Agreement between you and us and govern your use of Everhour, superseding any prior agreements between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms).

Amendments and changes to Everhour
----------------------------------

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Terms, at any time with or without a notice. Amendments or changes to these Terms will come into effect as soon as we post the revised Terms on the Website.

It is your responsibility to check the Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of Everhour following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the changes.

We reserve the right to do any of the following, at any time, without notice to you: (1) to modify, suspend or terminate operation of or access to Everhour, or any portion of Everhour for any reason; (2) to modify or change Everhour, or any portion of Everhour, and any applicable policies or terms; and (3) to interrupt the operation of Everhour, or any portion of Everhour, as necessary to perform routine or non-routine maintenance, error correction, or other changes.
