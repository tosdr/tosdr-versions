A _cookie_ is a small (temporary) text file that our Website(s) saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit our Website(s). These cookies are used to save your preferences to be used during a later visit (_e.g. your choice of language_). Additionally, cookies may also be used for marketing and remarketing purposes. 

A _web beacon_ is a transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1x1 pixels, used to monitor which web pages are visited on our websites. A web beacon is often used in combination with other cookies.

When we use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies in connection with our Websites, we will use the functions available to us to allow collection of non-personal or anonymized data only. (_For example, if we use Google Analytics, we will use the function available within Google Analytics for anonymizing your IP-address)._ Turning off your browser's cookies will prevent our web beacons from monitoring your activity on our Websites.

Additionally, you may also choose to configure your browser’s standard privacy and security settings, by installing certain browser specific add-ons (_such as “Google Analytics Opt-out Browser” add-on, which is currently available for most commonly used web browsers_)_._ You may review these settings and change them prior to, or after you visit our website(s). You may also choose to block or delete cookies. If you choose to change these settings after you have visited our website(s) (_e.g.:  deleting all cookies_), next time you visit our website(s) you may be asked to consent again to our use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. 

Some of the cookies we use are “_session cookies_” and some are “_persistent cookies_”. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your browsing session (thus the name “session cookies”). Persistent cookies remain longer on your device, for the duration established for each specific persistent cookie and will be automatically deleted at the end of their lifetime (persistent cookies remember your browsing choices, such as your choice of the language).

We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies on our Websites is the least privacy intrusive as possible. However, depending on your choice for accepting or refusing cookies, you may or may not be able to use some or all of our Websites’ features

To optimize your visit to our Websites, we recommend you accept our pre-existing cookie settings during your first visit. If you choose not to, or you change your mind, you may always deactivate or modify the existing cookies settings, by accessing our cookies notice.
