It collects and processes personal data that it needs to carry out its statutory functions and to operate as a public body, including employing and contracting staff. This general statement covers all of these various purposes. In most cases we will collect that data from you directly (for example, if you are applying for a licence from us), however from time to time we might need to collect personal data about you from a third party, such as your communications provider.

In accordance with our legal obligations this General Privacy Statement sets out the information you need to know about the way in which Ofcom will collect, process and store your personal data, how long we will keep it for, your rights in connection with that data, and the people with whom we may need to share it.

Whenever we request personal data for a specific purpose that is not covered in this General Privacy Statement we will explain why we need that information and our lawful basis for collecting it. Similarly, if in the future we intend to process your data for a purpose other than that for which it was collected, we will provide you with information on that purpose and any other relevant information.

Ofcom is committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with data protection legislation.

As an organisation Ofcom needs to employ staff and to contract with third-party service providers. Ofcom’s legal obligations include its obligations under the Equalities Act 2010, for example, and its duties as an employer under applicable employment and tax legislation.

### 

What personal data does Ofcom collect?

Depending on the purpose and context, the personal data Ofcom collects may include:

* Your name and job title
* Your contact information (which may include your IP address)
* Your occupation and employer’s details
* Your bank details and national insurance number
* Information relating to your age, disability status, racial or ethnic origin, political opinion and political affiliations, religious or philosophical belief, trade union membership, genetic data, health, sex, sexual orientation, gender and nationality, criminal convictions and offences

Ofcom may also from time to time collect personal data through the use of “fictional personas” when carrying out research into online media platforms’ processes and functions. This may involve interaction (like following/friending) with other accounts on the platform, including private accounts (in limited circumstances and in accordance with research protocols designed to minimise the impact on other users), where this is necessary for the purposes of the research. We will publish transparency notices notifying people about such research projects on our website.

### 

How will Ofcom use my personal data?

Ofcom may use your personal data for the purposes of carrying out its statutory functions, including Ofcom’s law enforcement functions, and complying with its legal obligations. Ofcom may also use your personal data where there are reasons of substantial public interest to do so, or where it has otherwise obtained your consent.

In particular, Ofcom may use your personal data for one or more of the following reasons:

* To carry out our statutory functions, for example:
    * Licensing, including granting and administering broadcast licences and licences for radio equipment and other wireless communications apparatus
    * Logging and handling complaints, including consumer complaints and fairness and privacy complaints
    * Undertaking regulatory investigations or investigations under the Competition Act 1998
    * Carrying out law enforcement activities, including investigating and prosecuting criminal offences relating to illegal broadcasting and unlawful use of wireless communications apparatus
    * Gathering and publishing evidence and opinions, including through consultations and carrying out research
    * Ensuring transparency and accountability in the way in which Ofcom carries out its regulatory activities.
* To improve our services;

* Organisations falling within the scope of Ofcom’s powers, third party complainants, and any representatives and expert witnesses engaged by those parties or Ofcom for the purposes of exercising our regulatory functions, including undertaking investigations and subsequent appeals. This includes, for example, allowing the subjects of an investigation (and where relevant, the complainant) access to the file, which allows those parties to understand the evidence that Ofcom is relying on in its provisional and final decisions;
* The police, or other law-enforcement bodies, for the purposes of undertaking investigations or where we are legally obliged to do so;
* Government departments and other regulatory bodies for the purposes of enabling us and them to carry out our respective legal and statutory functions.

* Third parties who we may employ to in order to process personal data on our behalf (in compliance with the requirements of data protection legislation). Such third parties may include those providing e-discovery services.

We may use machine learning programmes to help us as we analyse large datasets, but we will not use automated means to take decisions about individuals.

### 

How long will Ofcom keep my personal data for?

Ofcom will determine the period for which it needs to keep your personal data having regard to the reasons and purposes for which it was collected, our statutory duties and other legal obligations, the exercise and defence of any legal claims, including the period within which any current or potential future legal claims may be brought.

###
