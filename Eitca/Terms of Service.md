2\. In the case referred to in point 1a), the payment can be settled directly after or with the registration through one of the available methods. Payments in this case are usually finalised within a few seconds from their commencement.  
3\. In the case referred to in point 1b), the payment is considered settled after the funds are received on the EITCI Institute’s bank account. For correct identification of the payment it is essential to provide both full name of the Participant and the code of the chosen EITC/EITCA Programmes in the transfer title, according to the sent instructions.  
4\. EITCI Institute reserves the right to make other payment methods available additionally to those referred to in point 1.  
5\. Information about all currently available payment methods are published on the EITCA Academy websites.  
6\. The detailed terms of use for payment methods provided by external suppliers are specified in respective terms and conditions provided by these suppliers. Links to those terms and conditions are to be found on the EITCA Academy website. Using these forms of payment constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions mentioned above. EITCI Institute is not responsible for execution of the payment process by external suppliers.

#### §20

1\. Settling the payment is equivalent to conclusion of an agreement in electronic form between the Participant and EITCI Institute for the provision of selected certification service/services (hereinafter referred to as the Participation Agreement) in accordance with the description of the services provided on the EITCA Academy websites and the provisions of this T&C, and implies obtaining of EITCA Academy Participant status.  
2\. In case that the payment is not settled by the Participant themselves, or the Participant is exempt from the participation fees, the Participation Agreement is concluded in electronic form at the moment when the Participant orders relevant Certification Programmes with fees waived.  
3\. Conclusion of the Participation Agreement may also occur in other way (including writing form), if such possibility is provided by EITCI Institute, or by agreement of the parties.  
4\. EITCI Institute according with its policy provides subsidies which are granted in full fees exemption within the EITC / EITCA Certification Programmes to disabled persons, pre-tertiary school youth and people of low socio-economic status in number of low developed countries (including, but not limited to South Sudan, Syria, Palestinian Territory, Haiti, Yemen, Gambia, Malawi, Burundi, Congo, Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Chad, Liberia, Niger, Mozambique). Additionally EITCI Institute may provide subsidies for either EITC or EITCA Academy Certifications granted in partial fees reductions. In the former case qualification for the subsidized fees exemptions is performed upon a declaration of the Participant status that may be followed by a verification of proving documentation by EITCI Institute. In the latter case the subsidized partial fees reductions are accessible by dissemination of EITCI subsidy codes entitling to relevant fees reduction at the EITC / EITCA Certification order checkout valid to qualified Participants worldwide. The qualification for the EITCI subsidized partial fees reductions is determined based on the billed entity. For an individual person (either a consumer or a person engaged in the economic activity), a private company or a non-governmental organization the qualification for the EITCI subsidy is met, which is not the case for governmental bodies and agencies, including the European Commission and other publicly funded entities. As the number of subsidized places is limited, they are granted in tranches with 24-48 hours validity reservation deadlines and are assigned to the web browsers’ sessions of the potential Participants automatically. The Participant is able to use the subsidy automatically upon checking out (relevant subsidy will be accounted for in the corresponding programme’s fee reduction). After session-reserved subsidized places are not used by the Participant, they return to the pool of available subsidized places and can be granted to other Participants, while the used subsidized places are not available anymore. Monthly limits imposed on the subsidized places depend on the EITCI Institute’s funding capacity. In case of the EITCA Academy programmes subsidized via the complementarity criteria in the digital skills gap bridging goal, the EITCI support concerns only full EITCA Academy programmes participation, hence with no subsidies available for individually chosen single EITC programmes. This introduces EITCA Academy participation requirement in undertaking individual EITCA Academy constituent EITC programmes in an indicated order, so that the participation ensures the complementarity criteria of skills attested in a relevant digital specialization. Provision of the subsidies by EITCI Institute granted in the corresponding certification programmes fees reduction is solely at the discretion of EITCI Institute and is limited by its operational and funding capacity. EITCI Institute reserves the right to limit or suspend its subsidized certification programmes implementation at any time.

#### §21

1\. Full access to the EITCA Academies / EITC Programmes on the certification platform is activated after the payment is settled (after the electronically signing the Participation Agreement).  
2\. First event of logging in by the Participant to the ordered EITCA Academy / EITC Programme on the certification platform is considered a commencement of the actual provision of the service.
