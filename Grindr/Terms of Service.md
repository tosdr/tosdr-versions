   <strong>PREMIUM SERVICES; PURCHASES</strong>.  
   <ol>  
     <li>  
       <u>Premium Services.</u> Certain Services, such as Grindr Xtra or Grindr  
       Unlimited, may be available only through creation of a User Account and  
       payment of a fee (“Premium Services”). Through such accounts, You will  
       have access to such Premium Services for a fixed term, which will  
       automatically renew. The term, renewal period, and the total cost of  
       each Premium Services offering will be provided within the Grindr  
       Services or otherwise where the Premium Services are offered. Our  
       pricing varies based on a number of factors including, but not limited  
       to, region, bundle, and duration of subscription. Our pricing may change  
       prospectively and any such change shall take effect at the start of the  
       next subscription period following the date of the price change. We also  
       test new features and payment options.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>PREMIUM SERVICES AUTOMATICALLY RENEW.</u> PREMIUM SERVICES  
       AUTOMATICALLY RENEW CONTINUOUSLY AT THE END OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD,  
       AND YOUR PAYMENT METHOD WILL BE CHARGED THE THEN-CURRENT RENEWAL PRICE  
       (PLUS APPLICABLE TAXES) AUTOMATICALLY, WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL ACTION BY  
       YOU UNLESS YOU CANCEL AT LEAST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO RENEWAL. YOU  
       ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE PREMIUM SERVICES AUTOMATICALLY RENEW  
       UNLESS YOU CANCEL THEM OR WE SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THEM IN ACCORDANCE  
       WITH THIS AGREEMENT. AUTOMATIC RENEWAL MAY BE FOR VARYING DURATIONS,  
       E.G., A ONE-WEEK SUBSCRIPTION, ONE-MONTH SUBSCRIPTION, ETC.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>CANCELLATION POLICY.</u> YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR PREMIUM SERVICES AT ANY  
       TIME, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. CANCELLATION IS EFFECTIVE  
       ONLY AT THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT TERM. IN ORDER TO CANCEL, YOU MUST  
       UPDATE YOUR GRINDR SUBSCRIPTION SETTINGS IN YOUR ITUNES, GOOGLE PLAY, OR  
       GRINDR WEB ACCOUNT, DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ENROLLED. ALL PREVIOUSLY PAID  
       AMOUNTS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU CANCEL AN ANNUAL  
       SUBSCRIPTION FOR A PREMIUM SERVICE AFTER SIX MONTHS, YOU WILL NOT  
       RECEIVE A PRO-RATA RETURN OF YOUR ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND YOU WILL  
       CONTINUE TO HAVE USE OF THE PREMIUM SERVICE FOR THE REST OF THE  
       THEN-CURRENT ANNUAL PERIOD. INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANCELING PREMIUM SERVICES  
       ARE SET FORTH HEREIN, AT THE GRINDR HELP CENTER, AND BY EMAILING  
       <a href="mailto:[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)">[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)</a>.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Trial Premiums and Introductory Pricing.</u> Access to Grindr Premium  
       Services may from time to time be made available on a time-limited free  
       or discounted trial basis (a “Trial” or “Trial Premiums”). Please note  
       that this Agreement also applies to any Trial. You may be asked to  
       provide Your credit or debit card information when registering for a  
       Trial. For free Trials that autorenew, Your credit or debit card will  
       only be charged if You do not cancel Your Trial before the end of the  
       Trial period. Deleting Your account or deleting the application from  
       Your device does not cancel Your Trial. If We ask for Your credit or  
       debit card information and You do not affirmatively cancel before the  
       end of the Trial, then Your Trial will be automatically converted into a  
       paid subscription and Your credit or debit card will be charged the  
       subscription fee in effect at the time Your Trial first began and will  
       continue to automatically renew for subsequent terms unless and until  
       You cancel in accordance with the procedures set forth above. Trial  
       Premiums are not available to former Users of Premium Services or Users  
       who have previously received a free or discounted trial and canceled it  
       prior to paying for Premium Services. If Your transaction results in an  
       overdraft or other fee from Your card issuer due to going over Your  
       credit limit or having insufficient funds in Your account, Your card  
       issuer may charge You a fee, and You alone are responsible for that fee.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Purchases.</u> We reserve the right to correct errors (whether by  
       changing information on the Grindr Services or by informing You of the  
       error and giving You an opportunity to cancel Your order) or to update  
       information at any time without notice. We may grant or deny  
       cancellation requests for individual orders in Our sole and absolute  
       discretion. All sales are final.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Promo Codes.</u> Grindr may, from time to time in its sole  
       discretion, offer certain promotional codes for discounts. Promotional  
       codes are non-transferable and are not redeemable for cash, credit, or  
       toward previous purchases. There is no cash alternative. Furthermore,  
       promotional codes cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer or  
       promotional discount, and must be redeemed by the date published, if  
       provided. Lost promotional codes cannot be replaced. Limit one  
       promotional code per customer. Promotional codes are void where  
       prohibited. Any promotional program may be terminated or modified by  
       Grindr at any time in Our sole discretion.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Payments Are Non-Refundable.</u> Unless expressly provided otherwise  
       in this Agreement (including Section 25 where You are a resident in  
       certain states in the United States and the Special Terms where You are  
       a resident of certain countries) or as otherwise required under  
       applicable law, any and all payments made to Grindr are final and all  
       charges are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for  
       partially used periods. Cancellations are effective the following  
       billing period in which payment is due, except as otherwise expressly  
       provided in this Agreement.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Taxes.</u> Unless specified otherwise at the time of purchase, all  
       payments to Grindr are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed  
       by taxing authorities, and You are responsible for payment of all such  
       taxes, levies, or duties.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Microtransactions.</u> From time to time, You may be able to purchase  
       a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable  
       license to certain add-on features for use solely in the Grindr Services  
       (collectively, “Microtransactions”). Grindr reserves the right to charge  
       fees, in its sole discretion, for the right to access or use add-on  
       features and/or may distribute add-on features with or without charge.  
       Grindr may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate  
       Microtransactions and/or add-on features at any time. Any add-on feature  
       balance shown in Your User Account does not constitute a real-world  
       balance or reflect any stored value but instead constitutes a  
       measurement of the extent of Your license. Add-on features do not incur  
       fees for non-use; however, the license granted to You from  
       Microtransactions will terminate in accordance with the terms of this  
       Agreement when We cease providing the Grindr Services or Your User  
       Account is otherwise closed or terminated. Grindr shall have no  
       liability to You or any third party in the event that Grindr exercises  
       any such rights. The provision of add-on features for use in the Grindr  
       Services is a service that commences immediately upon the acceptance of  
       such Microtransactions. ALL MICROTRANSACTIONS PURCHASES MADE THROUGH THE  
       GRINDR SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT  
       GRINDR IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU  
       WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED ADD-ON FEATURES  
       WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR  
       INVOLUNTARY.  
     </li>  
   </ol>  
 </li>  
<li>  
   <strong>YOUR USAGE</strong>.  
   <ol>  
     <li>  
       You acknowledge that some of the Grindr Services may only be accessed by  
       downloading the Grindr Software to Your device. You will not have the  
       opportunity to view Your User Content (including chat) unless You have  
       downloaded the Grindr Software and registered an account.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       GRINDR RESERVES THE RIGHT, BUT HAS NO OBLIGATION, TO MONITOR ANY USER’S  
       USE OF THE GRINDR SERVICES, INCLUDING A USER’S REGISTRATION OR  
       MESSAGING, AS WELL AS A USER’S USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE LOCATION  
       INFORMATION AND PROFILES OF OTHER USERS. ACCORDINGLY, GRINDR ALSO  
       RESERVES THE RIGHT TO (A) DISABLE ANY USER’S USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE  
       GRINDR SERVICES, INCLUDING THE LOCATION INFORMATION OR PROFILES OF OTHER  
       USERS; OR (B) TERMINATE ANY USER’S ACCOUNT, FOR ANY REASON AND WITHOUT  
       ANY NOTICE OR OUR BEING LIABLE TO YOU. REFUNDS WILL ONLY BE GIVEN WHERE  
       EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       You alone are responsible for Your involvement with other Users and for  
       all content and material that You provide to the Grindr Services. You  
       agree that Grindr will not be responsible for any loss or damage  
       incurred as the result of any such interactions. Grindr reserves the  
       right, but has no obligation, to monitor disagreements between You and  
       other Users.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       Grindr does not control the content of User Accounts and profiles.  
       Grindr has the right, but does not have any obligation, to monitor such  
       content for any purpose. You acknowledge that You are solely responsible  
       for all content and material that You provide to the Grindr Services.  
     </li>  
   </ol>  
 </li><li>  
   <strong>OUR REFUSAL OR SUSPENSION OF YOUR SERVICE</strong>.  
   <ol>  
     <li>  
       You may terminate Your Account at any time for any reason, by following  
       the instructions given in the Grindr Services. Upon the cancellation of  
       Your account, this Agreement will immediately terminate, except as  
       provided in Section 25 below.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       If You have a User Account set up for recurring billing for a Premium  
       Service, You may cancel Your User Account at any time. You will continue  
       to have the same access for any billing period or periods for which You  
       have paid.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       Grindr may suspend or terminate any User Account You have with the  
       Grindr Services or Your access to or use of the Grindr Services or any  
       portion thereof, if Grindr believes that Your profile content or Your  
       conduct within the Grindr Services violates Our Terms of Service or You  
       have otherwise breached this Agreement, or for any other reason, in its  
       sole discretion, subject to Sections 12.4 and 12.5 below. Grindr may  
       also remove and discard all or any part of Your User Account or any User  
       Content (as defined below), at any time. You agree that any termination  
       of Your access to the Grindr Services or any User Account You may have  
       or portion thereof may be effected without prior notice (except as  
       provided in Section 12.4 below), and You agree that Grindr will not be  
       liable to You or any third party for any such termination and refunds  
       will only be given where expressly provided in this Agreement (including  
       Section 12.5 below). For example, We may deactivate Your User Account  
       due to prolonged inactivity. Without limitation of Our other rights, We  
       reserve the right to delete all Your User Content from the Grindr  
       Services upon any termination or cancellation of Your User Account. Any  
       suspected fraudulent, abusive illegal activity, or circumstances where  
       We believe there is a risk of physical harm or a threat to the safety of  
       others, may be grounds for termination of Your use of the Grindr  
       Services and may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.  
       These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Grindr may have at  
       law or in equity.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       If You have paid for a Premium Service, Grindr will give You at least 30  
       days’ notice of termination of Your access to the Grindr Services or any  
       User Account unless Your profile content or Your conduct within the  
       Grindr Services violates Our Terms of Service or You have otherwise  
       breached this Agreement, in which case Grindr may suspend or terminate  
       Your access to the Grindr Services or any User Account immediately.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       If You have paid for a Premium Service and Grindr terminates Your access  
       to the Grindr Services or any user Account, Grindr will give a pro-rata  
       refund for any amounts pre-paid, but unused for such Premium Services;  
       provided that if Grindr terminates Your access to the Grindr Services or  
       any User Account because You have violated Our Terms of Service, Grindr  
       will be entitled to retain the amounts that You paid for the Grindr  
       Services. But where required by law (such as in the UK), Grindr will  
       only retain an amount to cover all costs and other losses it incurs as a  
       result of the violation or breach, which may still mean that no refund  
       is payable.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       You acknowledge and agree that Google, Apple, or another third-party  
       platform provider (as applicable, based on the device and operating  
       system You use) may be the merchant of record for transactions involving  
       the Grindr Services. As such, You may need to request any refund to  
       which You are entitled under this Agreement through the App Store,  
       Google Play, or other third-party platform (as applicable).

   DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE. YOU FURTHER  
   ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF

   <strong>YOU RELEASE US.</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by

   every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right,

   (including personal injuries, emotional distress, identity theft, death,

     >RESOLVING OUR DISPUTES; AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.</strong  
   >  
   Please read the following arbitration provision carefully. Unless You opt  
   out in the manner described in subsections 13 and 14 below, this arbitration  
   provision requires You and Grindr to arbitrate disputes and limits the  
   manner in which relief may be sought (“Arbitration Agreement”).  
   <ol>  
     <li>  
       You and Grindr agree that any dispute arising out of or relating in any  
       way to Your use of or access to the Grindr Services, including the  
       validity, scope, interpretation, breach, enforcement, or termination of  
       this Agreement, or otherwise relating to Grindr in any way  
       (collectively, “Covered Dispute Matters” or “Disputes”) will be resolved  
       in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 22. For  
       avoidance of doubt, this Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to claims  
       where such application is prohibited by applicable law.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Informal Resolution.</u> You and Grindr agree that good faith,  
       informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low-cost,  
       and mutually-beneficial outcome. You and Grindr therefore agree that  
       before either party commences arbitration against the other (or  
       initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), You and  
       We will personally meet and confer telephonically or via  
       videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any  
       Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute  
       Resolution Conference” or “Conference”). If You are represented by  
       counsel, Your counsel may participate in the conference, but You will  
       also participate in the conference. The party initiating a Dispute must  
       give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate a  
       Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days  
       after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is  
       mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Grindr that You intend to  
       initiate a Conference should be sent by email to  
       <a href="mailto:[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)">[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)</a>. The Notice must  
       include: (1) Your name, phone number, mailing address, and the email  
       address associated with Your User Account (if You have one); (2) the  
       name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of Your  
       counsel, if any; and (3) a description of Your Dispute. The Conference  
       shall be individualized such that a separate Conference must be held  
       each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or  
       group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless  
       all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot  
       participate in the same Conference unless all parties agree. In the time  
       between a party receiving the Notice and the Conference, nothing in this  
       Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in  
       informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.  
       Engaging in the Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that  
       must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of  
       limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the  
       parties engage in the Conference process required by this section.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Applicable Law.</u> You and We agree that United States federal law  
       including Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), and (to  
       the extent not inconsistent with or pre-empted by federal law) the laws  
       of the State of California, USA, without regard to conflict of laws  
       principles, will govern all Covered Dispute Matters, except as may be  
       expressly provided in the Special Terms.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Our Arbitration.</u> You and We agree that this provision and each of  
       its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the  
       FAA applies in all cases and governs the interpretation and enforcement  
       of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings. Any Covered  
       Dispute Matter must be asserted individually in binding arbitration  
       administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in  
       accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (including utilizing  
       desk, phone or video conference proceedings where appropriate and  
       permitted to mitigate costs of travel) available at  
       <a  
         href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf"  
         target="\_blank"  
         rel="noopener"  
         >https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf</a  
       >. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an  
       alternative arbitral forum. If the Informal Dispute Resolution  
       Conference does not resolve the Dispute in a satisfactory manner within  
       forty-five (45) days after receipt of a Notice, You and Grindr agree  
       that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute  
       through binding arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration  
       Agreement.<br />  
       <br />  
       A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party  
       with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The Request must include  
       (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, email address of the  
       party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as  
       well as the email address associated with any applicable User Account;  
       (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases  
       of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate,  
       good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States  
       Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Information  
       Dispute Resolution process as above; and (5) evidence that the  
       requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with  
       such arbitration. If the party requesting arbitration is represented by  
       counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone  
       number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign  
       the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of  
       counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry  
       reasonable under the circumstances that: (1) the Request is not being  
       presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary  
       delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the  
       claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing  
       law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing  
       existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and  
       damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so  
       identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable  
       opportunity for further investigation or discovery.<br />  
       <br />  
       The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to  
       practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the  
       parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the  
       parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35)  
       days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the  
       arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch  
       Arbitration (defined below) process under subsection 9 is triggered, the  
       AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.<br />  
       <br />  
       Unless You and Grindr otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted  
       in the county where You reside, or as determined by the arbitrator in  
       the case of Batch Arbitration. Unless You and Grindr otherwise agree,  
       the arbitration will be conducted virtually via video or teleconference.  
       Upon request by either party, the arbitrator may, at their discretion,  
       require an in-person hearing. You and We agree that the arbitrator shall  
       have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without  
       limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the  
       Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability,  
       scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the  
       Arbitration Agreement, except that all Disputes regarding the subsection  
       entitled “Waiver of Certain Rights,” including any claim or Dispute that  
       all or part of that subsection is unenforceable, illegal, void or  
       voidable, or that that such subsection has been breached, shall be  
       decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  
       The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of  
       all or part of any Dispute.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>The Arbitrator’s Award to You or Us.</u> You and We agree that for  
       matters where the relief sought is over $5,000, the arbitrator’s written  
       decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which  
       the arbitrator based the award. The arbitrator will decide the substance  
       of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized  
       principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized  
       by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior  
       arbitrations involving different Users, but is bound by rulings in prior  
       arbitrations involving the same Grindr User to the extent required by  
       applicable law. You and We agree that the arbitrator’s award shall be  
       final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator  
       may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.</u> Subject to this Arbitration  
       Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief  
       only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the  
       extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual  
       claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect  
       the terms and conditions under the subsection 9 entitled “Batch  
       Arbitration.”  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Exceptions To Our Agreement To Arbitrate Disputes.</u> There are  
       three exceptions to this provision to arbitrate:  
       <ol>  
         <li>  
           First, if either party reasonably believes that the other party has  
           in any manner violated or threatened to infringe the intellectual  
           property rights of the other party, the party whose rights have been  
           violated may seek injunctive or other appropriate interim relief in  
           any court of competent jurisdiction.  
         </li>  
         <li>  
           Second, each party will retain the right to seek relief in a small  
           claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of the  
           jurisdiction of such courts.  
         </li>  
         <li>  
           Third, where application of this provision to arbitrate is  
           prohibited by applicable law.  
         </li>  
       </ol>  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Costs of Arbitration.</u> You and We agree that payment of all  
       filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the  
       AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this provision to arbitrate. The  
       parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration  
       unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the dispute or  
       the relief sought in the request for arbitration was frivolous or was  
       brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth  
       in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Batch Arbitration.</u> To increase the efficiency of administration  
       and resolution of arbitrations, You and Grindr agree that in the event  
       that there are ten (10) or more individual requests for arbitration of a  
       substantially similar nature filed against Grindr by or with the  
       assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations,  
       within a ninety (90) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the  
       AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100  
       requests per batch (or, if between ten (10) and ninety-nine (99)  
       individual Requests are filed, a single batch of all those Requests,  
       and, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests remaining after the  
       batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining  
       Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide  
       for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration  
       with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch,  
       one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be  
       determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch  
       Arbitration”).<br />  
       All parties agree that requests are of a “substantially similar nature”  
       if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and  
       raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar  
       relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the  
       Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA,  
       and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the  
       applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative  
       Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by  
       the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative  
       Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any  
       disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by  
       Grindr.<br />  
       You and Grindr agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to  
       implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single  
       filing and administrative fees for batches of requests, as well as any  
       steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include:  
       (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the  
       arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption  
       of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.<br />  
       This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as  
       authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any  
       kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any  
       circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this subsection.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate.</u> Notwithstanding  
       any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, You and We agree that  
       if We make any material amendment to this Arbitration Agreement in the  
       future, We will notify You and that amendment shall not apply to any  
       claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Grindr prior to the  
       effective date of the amendment. However, the amendment shall apply to  
       all other disputes or claims governed by the agreement to arbitrate that  
       have arisen or may arise between You and Grindr. If You do not agree to  
       these amended terms, You may close Your User Account within thirty (30)  
       days of the posting or notification and You will not be bound by the  
       amended terms. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide You  
       with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if You  
       have previously agreed to a version of this Arbitration Agreement and  
       did not validly opt out of arbitration.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes.</u> Unless You and We agree  
       otherwise and except as described in Section 22.7.2 (Small Claims  
       Court), in the event that the agreement to arbitrate above is found not  
       to apply to You or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result  
       of Your decision to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, as a result  
       of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, because the claim is  
       not subject to arbitration pursuant to applicable law, or because You  
       are an international user to which this agreement to arbitrate does not  
       apply, You agree (except as otherwise provided by law) that any claim or  
       dispute that has arisen or may arise between You and Grindr must be  
       resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Los Angeles  
       County, California. You and Grindr agree to submit to the exclusive  
       personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Los Angeles County,  
       California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Arbitration Severability Clause.</u> Except as provided in the  
       subsection entitled “Waiver of Certain Rights,” if any part or parts of  
       this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or  
       unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and  
       effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration  
       Agreement will remain in full force.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION.</u> IF YOU ARE A NEW GRINDR USER, YOU  
       CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE PROVISION (“OPT-OUT”) BY  
       EMAILING US AN OPT-OUT NOTICE TO  
       <a href="mailto:[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)"  
         >[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)</a

       (“OPT-OUT NOTICE”). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED WITHIN  
       THIRTY-ONE (31) DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS  
       AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. IF YOU ARE NOT A NEW GRINDR USER, YOU HAVE  
       UNTIL THIRTY-ONE (31) DAYS AFTER THE POSTING OF MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE  
       ARBITRATION PROVISION TO SUBMIT AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Arbitration Opt-Out Procedure.</u> In order to opt-out, within  
       thirty-one (31) days after You accept the terms of this Agreement for  
       the first time, or the modified terms following a material change of  
       this Arbitration Agreement, You must email Your legal name, mailing  
       address (including street address, city, state, and zip code), email  
       address(es) associated with Your Account(s) to which the opt-out  
       applies, and an unaltered digital image of Your valid driver’s license

       >. This procedure is the only way You can opt out of the agreement to  
       arbitrate. If You opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts  
       of this Agreement and this Disputes Section (including Sections 20 (You  
       Acknowledge the Benefit of the Bargain with Grindr) and 15 through 19  
       (15 -Advertising; 16 – End User Licenses; 17 – Our Disclaimers; No  
       Warranties to You, 18 – Your Indemnification of Us; You Hold Grindr  
       Harmless, and 19 – Limitation of Our Liability and of Your Damages))  
       will continue to apply to You.  
       <strong

     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS.</u> BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND  
       GRINDR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS  
       TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY (OTHER  
       THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE. EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS  
       AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS,  
       REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL  
       RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR  
       ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.  
       ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE. YOU AGREE THAT YOU CANNOT SERVE AS  
       A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER  
       REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF  
       CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING FILED AGAINST  
       US AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES, EVEN IF ARBITRATION IS NOT REQUIRED  
       UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SUBSECTION 9 OF THIS SECTION  
       ABOVE. You and Grindr are instead electing that all Disputes shall be  
       resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as  
       specified in subsection 9 above. There is no judge or jury in  
       arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very  
       limited review. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  
       Arbitration Agreement, if a final decision, not subject to any further  
       appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this subsection,  
       “Waiver of Certain Rights,” are invalid or unenforceable as to a  
       particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public  
       injunctive relief ), You and Grindr agree that that particular claim or  
       request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for  
       relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in  
       the state or federal courts located in the State of California. All  
       other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.

       limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those  
       statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent

       infringer is a User who has been notified by Grindr of infringing  
       activity violations more than twice and/or who has had a User Content  
       removed from the Grindr Services more than twice. (Note that We reserve  
       the right to terminate accounts for a single infringement as well  
       pursuant to Section 8).

       <u>Cancellation within 14-day cancellation period.</u> You have the

       You to send Your communication concerning Your exercise of the right to  
       cancel before the cancellation period has expired. There are no separate  
       cancellation fees but there are no refunds except as provided herein. We  
       will refund You a pro-rata amount of the Premium fee for the unused  
       period of Your Premium Services. You will still be required to pay a  
       Premium Service fee for the period of Your Premium Services until You  
       communicated to Us Your cancellation, (excluding any free trial period  
       where no payment was taken) and We will therefore not refund You for  
       that portion of Your Premium Services. We will make the refund without  
       undue delay and not later than fourteen (14) days after the day on which  
       We are informed about Your decision to cancel Your Premium Services. We

       not have privacy protections equivalent to the

   <u>ARGENTINA.</u> The following terms apply to You, and supersede

   extent required by applicable law:  
   <ol>  
     <li>  
       <u>Cancellation Within 10-day Cancellation Period.</u> You have the  
       right to cancel Your Premium Services within ten (10) days without  
       giving any reason. The cancellation period will expire after ten (10)  
       days from Your purchase of the Premium Services. If You have benefitted  
       from a free trial, the cancellation period will expire ten (10) days  
       from the beginning of Your free trial. To exercise the right to cancel  
       Your Premium Services during the ten (10) day cancellation period, You  
       must inform Us at  
       <a href="mailto:[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)">[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)</a> of Your decision to  
       cancel by a clear statement. We will communicate to You an  
       acknowledgment of receipt of such cancellation by email without delay.  
       To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for You to send Your  
       communication concerning Your exercise of the right to cancel before the  
       cancellation period has expired. There are no separate cancellation fees  
       but there are no refunds except as provided herein. We will refund You a  
       pro-rata amount of the Premium Services fee for the unused period of  
       Your Premium Services. You will still be required to pay a Premium  
       Service fee for the period of Your Premium Services until You  
       communicated to Us Your cancellation (excluding any free trial period  
       where no payment was taken), and We will therefore not refund You for  
       that portion of Your Premium Services. We will make the refund without  
       undue delay. We will issue the refund using the same means of payment as  
       You used for the initial transaction, unless You have expressly agreed  
       otherwise.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Notice and Takedown Policy.</u> If You are a resident of Argentina,  
       the notice and takedown policy in section 23 will not apply to You.  
       Instead, in case You believe that any content hosted on any Grindr  
       Service produces damage to You and could be considered as manifestly  
       illegal, then You may submit a notification to Grindr indicating the  
       content in question and providing documentation that proves Your  
       identity as well as detailing the damage caused by the content. Grindr  
       will analyze the claim and if the content is manifestly illegal (i.e.  
       child pornography, data that facilities the commission of a crime, crime  
       or racism references, etc.), then Grindr will proceed with its takedown.  
       Any other content that causes damage but cannot be considered as  
       manifestly illegal shall not be taken down by Grindr unless You provide  
       a judicial notification ordering the takedown of the content in  
       question. Notifications of any sort for these purposes shall be  
       delivered to <a href="mailto:[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)">[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)</a>.

       Grindr Services during the seven (7) day cancellation period, You must  
       inform Us at <a href="mailto:[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)">[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)</a> of  
       Your decision to cancel by a clear statement. We will communicate to You  
       an acknowledgment of receipt of such cancellation by email without  
       delay. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for You to  
       send Your communication concerning Your exercise of the right to cancel  
       before the cancellation period has expired. We will refund any and all  
       amount paid by You. We will make the refund without undue delay and  
       within the shortest timeframe possible after the day on which We are  
       informed about Your decision to cancel. We will issue the refund using  
       the same means of payment as You used for the initial transaction,  
       unless You have expressly agreed otherwise.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Arbitration Will Not Apply to You.</u> Any dispute procedure deriving  
       from this Agreement will be resolved by a competent Court of the

       measures in order to remove it, to the extent applicable.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Application of Brazilian Law.</u> You and We agree that Brazilian Law

       privacy, protection of personal data, and secrecy of private  
       communications and of logs. You and We agree to comply with all  
       applicable Brazilian law.  
     </li>

       service and continue using the portion of the Grindr Services that is

     <li>  
       <u>Limitation of Liability.</u> The provisions related to limitation of  
       liability established under this Agreement may, as a general rule, not  
       apply to You, as the obligation to indemnify is a rule of public order  
       in Brazil. You and We are aware that Brazilian law does not allow  
       indemnification for indirect damages, but solely the effective losses  
       and the loss of profits directly and immediately caused by it.  
     </li>  
     <li>  
       <u>Statute of Limitations for Your Claims.</u> The provisions of this  
       Agreement related to statute of limitations may not apply to You, if the  
       applicable Brazilian law establishes a different or specific statute of  
       limitations for a certain claim. In this case, You will be subject to

   <u>ISRAEL.</u> The following terms apply to You, and supersede conflicting  
   terms in this Agreement, if You are a resident of Israel, to the extent  
   required by applicable law:  
   <ol>  
     <li>  
       Cancellation Rights. You have the right to cancel Your Premium Services  
       fourteen (14) calendar days without giving any reason. The cancellation  
       period will expire after fourteen (14) calendar days from Your purchase  
       of the Premium Services. To exercise the right to cancel Your Premium  
       Services during the fourteen (14) day cancellation period, You must  
       inform Us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) of Your decision to cancel by a clear  
       statement. We will communicate to You an acknowledgment of receipt of  
       such cancellation by email without delay. To meet the cancellation  
       deadline, it is sufficient for You to send Your communication concerning  
       Your exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has  
       expired. We will communicate to You an acknowledgment of receipt of such  
       cancellation by email without delay. To meet the cancellation deadline,  
       it is sufficient for You to send Your communication concerning Your  
       exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has  
       expired. There are no separate cancellation fees but there are no  
       refunds except as provided herein. We will refund You a pro-rata amount  
       of the Premium fee for the unused period of Your Premium Services. You  
       will still be required to pay a Premium Service fee for the period of  
       Your Premium Services until You communicated to Us Your cancellation,  
       (excluding any free trial period where no payment was taken) and We will  
       therefore not refund You for that portion of Your Premium Services. We  
       will make the refund without undue delay and not later than fourteen  
       (14) days after the day on which We are informed about Your decision to  
       cancel Your Premium Services. We will issue the refund using the same  
       means of payment as You used for the initial transaction, unless You  
       have expressly agreed otherwise.  
     </li>  
   </ol>  
 </li><li>  
   <u>CERTAIN OTHER JURISDICTIONS WITH CANCELLATION RIGHTS.</u> The following  
   terms apply to You, and supersede conflicting terms in this Agreement, if  
   You are a resident of a jurisdiction with laws which may require notice of  
   cancellation rights, to the extent required by applicable law:  
   <ol>  
     <li>  
       Cancellation Rights. Residents of certain jurisdictions may have the  
       right to cancel this Agreement as required by local law. Grindr will  
       honor such cancellation rights.
