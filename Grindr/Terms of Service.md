              <u>Trial Premiums.</u>&nbsp;Access to Grindr Premium Services may  
              from time to time be made available on a time-limited free trial  
              basis (a “Trial” or “Trial Premiums”). Please note that this  
              Agreement also applies to any Trial. You may be asked to provide  
              Your credit or debit card information when registering for a  
              Trial. In such event,&nbsp;Your&nbsp;credit or debit card will only be  
              charged if You do not cancel Your Trial before the end of the  
              Trial period. If We ask for Your credit or debit card

              of the Trial, then Your Trial may be converted into a paid  
              subscription and Your credit or debit card may be charged the

              cancel Your order) or to update information at any time without  
              notice. We may grant or deny cancellation requests for  
              individual orders in Our sole and absolute discretion. All sales  
              are final.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Promo Codes.</u>&nbsp;Grindr may, from time to time in its sole  
              discretion, offer certain promotional codes for discounts.  
              Promotional codes are non-transferable and are not redeemable  
              for cash, credit, or toward previous purchases. There is no cash  
              alternative. Furthermore, promotional codes cannot be used in  
              conjunction with any other offer or promotional discount, and  
              must be redeemed by the date published, if provided. Lost  
              promotional codes cannot be replaced. Limit one promotional code  
              per customer. Promotional codes are void where prohibited. Any  
              promotional program may be terminated or modified by Grindr at

              countries),&nbsp;any and all&nbsp;payments made to Grindr are final and  
              all charges are nonrefundable. Cancellations are effective the

            <li>  
              <u>Taxes.</u>&nbsp;Unless specified otherwise at the time of  
              purchase, all payments to Grindr are exclusive of all taxes,  
              levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and You are  
              responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Microtransactions.</u>&nbsp;From time to time,&nbsp;You&nbsp;may be able to  
              purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable,  
              non-sublicensable, revocable license to certain add-on features  
              for use solely in the Grindr Services (collectively,  
              “Microtransactions”). Grindr reserves the right to charge fees,  
              in its sole discretion, for the right to access or use add-on  
              features and/or may distribute add-on features with or without  
              charge. Grindr may manage, regulate, control, modify or  
              eliminate Microtransactions and/or add-on features at any time.  
              Any add-on feature balance shown in Your User Account does not  
              constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value but  
              instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of Your license.  
              Add-on features do not incur fees for non-use; however, the  
              license granted to You from Microtransactions will terminate in  
              accordance with the terms of this Agreement when We cease  
              providing the Grindr Services or Your User Account is otherwise  
              closed or terminated. Grindr shall have no liability to You or  
              any third party&nbsp;in the event that&nbsp;Grindr exercises any such  
              rights. The provision of add-on features for use in the Grindr  
              Services is a service that commences immediately upon the  
              acceptance of such Microtransactions. ALL MICROTRANSACTIONS MADE  
              THROUGH THE GRINDR SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. YOU  
              ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GRINDR IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR  
              ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER  
              COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED ADD-ON FEATURES WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS  
              CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.

              for any such termination and refunds will only be given where  
              expressly provided in this Agreement (including Section 12.5

          <strong>RESOLVING OUR DISPUTES; AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.</strong>&nbsp;Please read the following arbitration provision in this carefully.  
          Unless you opt out in the manner described in subsections 12 and 13  
          below, this arbitration provision requires you to arbitrate disputes  
          with Grindr and limits the&nbsp;manner in which&nbsp;you seek relief from us.  
          <ol>  
            <li>  
              You and Grindr agree that any dispute that has arisen or may  
              arise between us relating in any way to Your use of or access to  
              the Grindr Services, any validity, interpretation, breach,  
              enforcement, or termination of this Agreement, or otherwise  
              relating to Grindr in any way (collectively, “Covered Dispute  
              Matters” or “Disputes”) will be resolved in accordance with the  
              provisions set forth in this Section 22.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Informal Resolution.</u>&nbsp;You and Grindr agree that good  
              faith, informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a  
              prompt, low-cost, and&nbsp;mutually-beneficial&nbsp;outcome. You and  
              Grindr therefore agree that before either party commences  
              arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small  
              claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and  
              confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith  
              effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this  
              arbitration provision (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”  
              or “Conference”). If You are represented by  
              counsel,&nbsp;Your&nbsp;counsel may participate in the conference, but You  
              will also participate in the conference. The party initiating a  
              Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its  
              intent to initiate a Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur  
              within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such  
              Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the  
              parties. Notice to Grindr that You intend to initiate a  
              Conference should be sent by email to  
              <a href="mailto:[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)">[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)</a>. The  
              Notice must include: (1) Your name, phone number, mailing  
              address, and the email address associated with Your User Account  
              (if You have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing  
              address and email address of Your counsel, if any; and (3) a  
              description of Your Dispute. The Conference shall be  
              individualized such that a separate Conference must be held each  
              time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm  
              or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar  
              cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating  
              a Dispute cannot participate in the same Conference unless all  
              parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice  
              and the Conference, nothing in this arbitration provision shall  
              prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to  
              resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the  
              Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be  
              fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of  
              limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while  
              the parties engage in the Conference process required by this  
              section.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Applicable Law.</u>&nbsp;You and We agree that United States  
              federal law including Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et  
              seq. (“FAA”), and (to the extent not inconsistent with or  
              pre-empted by federal law) the laws of the State of California,  
              USA, without regard to conflict of laws principles, will govern  
              all Covered Dispute Matters, except as may be expressly provided  
              in the Special Terms.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Our Arbitration.</u>&nbsp;You and We agree that this provision and  
              each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate  
              commerce, and the FAA applies in all cases and governs the  
              interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and  
              arbitration proceedings. Any Covered Dispute Matter must be  
              asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by the  
              American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its  
              Consumer Arbitration Rules (including utilizing desk, phone or  
              video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to  
              mitigate costs of travel)&nbsp;available at&nbsp;<a target="\_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf</a>.  
              <br>  
              A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the  
              other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The  
              Request must include (1) the name, telephone number, mailing  
              address, email address of the party seeking arbitration and the  
              account username (if applicable) as well as the email address  
              associated with any applicable User Account; (2) a statement of  
              the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those  
              claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate,  
              good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United  
              States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the  
              Information Dispute Resolution process as above; and (5)  
              evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing  
              fees in connection with such arbitration. If the party  
              requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request  
              shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing  
              address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the  
              Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best  
              of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an  
              inquiry reasonable under the circumstances that: (1) the Request  
              is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to  
              harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost  
              of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal  
              contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous  
              argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or  
              for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages  
              contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so  
              identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a  
              reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.  
              <br>  
              The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney  
              licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be  
              selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer  
              dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an  
              arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the  
              Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance  
              with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration  
              process under subsection 9 is triggered, the AAA will appoint  
              the arbitrator for each batch.  
              <br>  
              <br>  
              Unless you and Grindr otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration  
              process discussed in subsection 9 below is triggered, the  
              arbitration will be conducted in the county where you  
              reside.&nbsp;&nbsp;You and We agree that the arbitrator, and not any  
              federal, international, state, or local court or agency, shall  
              have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the  
              interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of  
              this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this  
              Agreement is void or voidable or a particular claim is subject  
              to arbitration, except for the following: (1) all disputes  
              arising out of or relating to subsection 14 of this Section  
              including any claim that all or part of that same subsection is  
              unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that that same  
              subsection has been breached, shall be decided by a court of  
              competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as  
              expressly contemplated in subsection 9, all disputes about the  
              payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of  
              competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all  
              disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition  
              precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of  
              competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all  
              disputes about which version of the arbitration provision  
              applies shall be decided only by a court of competent  
              jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>The Arbitrator’s Award to You or Us.</u>&nbsp;You and We agree  
              that for matters where the relief sought is over $5,000, the  
              arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and  
              conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The  
              arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance  
              with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity,  
              and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The  
              arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations  
              involving different&nbsp;Users, but&nbsp;is bound by rulings in prior  
              arbitrations involving the same Grindr User to the extent  
              required by applicable law. You and We agree that the  
              arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on  
              the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court  
              having jurisdiction thereof.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.</u>&nbsp;Subject to this  
              Arbitration provision, the arbitrator may award declaratory or  
              injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking  
              relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief  
              warranted by the party's individual claim. Nothing in this  
              paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and  
              conditions under the subsection 9 entitled “Batch Arbitration.”  
              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration  
              Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not  
              subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations  
              of this subsection, “Waiver of Class and Other  
              Non-Individualized Relief,” are invalid or unenforceable as to a  
              particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for  
              public injunctive relief ), You and Grindr agree that that  
              particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular  
              claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the  
              arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts  
              located in the State of California. All other Disputes shall be  
              arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection  
              does not prevent You or Grindr from participating in a  
              class-wide settlement of claims.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Exceptions To Our Agreement&nbsp;To&nbsp;Arbitrate Disputes.</u>&nbsp;There  
              are only two exceptions to this provision to arbitrate:  
              <ol>  
                <li>  
                  First, if either party reasonably believes that the other  
                  party has in any manner violated or threatened to infringe  
                  the intellectual property rights of the other party, the  
                  party whose rights have been violated may seek injunctive or

                  Second, each party will retain the right to seek relief in a  
                  small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope  
                  of the jurisdiction of such courts.

              <u>Costs of Arbitration.</u>&nbsp;You and We agree that payment of  
              all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed  
              by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this&nbsp;provision to  
              arbitrate. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and  
              costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the  
              substance of the dispute or the relief sought in the request for  
              arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose  
              (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil  
              Procedure 11(b)).  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Batch Arbitration</u>. To increase the efficiency of  
              administration and resolution of arbitrations, You and Grindr  
              agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more  
              individual requests for arbitration of a substantially similar  
              nature filed against Grindr by or with the assistance of the  
              same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a  
              thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the  
              AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of  
              100 requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than  
              100 requests left over after the batching described above, a  
              final batch consisting of the remaining requests); (2) appoint  
              one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the  
              resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration  
              with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per  
              batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place  
              to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch  
              Arbitration”).  
              <p>  
                All parties agree that requests are of a “substantially  
                similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same  
                event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal  
                issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the  
                parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration  
                process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the  
                AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the  
                applicability of the Batch Arbitration process  
                (“Administrative Arbitrator”).&nbsp;In an effort to&nbsp;expedite  
                resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative  
                Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator  
                may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any  
                disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall  
                be paid by Grindr.  
              </p>  
              <p>  
                You and Grindr agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA  
                to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the  
                payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches  
                of requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and  
                costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment  
                of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the  
                resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an  
                expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.  
              </p>  
              <p>  
                This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be  
                interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass  
                arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving  
                joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except  
                as expressly set forth in this subsection.

            <li>  
              <u>Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate.</u>&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the  
              contrary, You and We agree that if We make any amendment to this  
              agreement to arbitrate in the future, that amendment shall not  
              apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against  
              Grindr prior to the effective date of the amendment. However,  
              the amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims  
              governed by the agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may  
              arise between You and Grindr. If You do not agree to these  
              amended terms,&nbsp;You&nbsp;may close Your User Account within thirty  
              (30) days of the posting or notification and You will not be  
              bound by the amended terms. Changes to this arbitration  
              agreement do not provide You with a new opportunity to opt out  
              of the arbitration agreement if You have previously agreed to a  
              version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of  
              arbitration.

            <li>  
              <u>Venue for Arbitration.</u>  
              Any arbitration instituted pursuant to these Terms shall be held

              mutually agree, including via video conference.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes.</u>&nbsp;Unless You and We  
              agree otherwise and except as described in Section 22.2 (Small  
              Claims Court), in the event that the agreement to arbitrate  
              above is found not to apply to You or to a particular claim or  
              dispute, either as a result of Your decision to opt out of the  
              agreement to arbitrate, as a result of a decision by the  
              arbitrator or a court order, or because You are an international  
              user to which this agreement to arbitrate does not apply, You  
              agree (except as otherwise provided by law) that any claim or  
              dispute that has arisen or may arise between You and Grindr must  
              be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in  
              Los Angeles County, California. You and Grindr agree to submit  
              to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located  
              within Los Angeles County, California for the purpose of  
              litigating all such claims or disputes.

              <u>Arbitration Severability Clause</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any part or parts of  
              this Arbitration Provision are found under the law to be invalid  
              or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of  
              no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of  
              the Arbitration Agreement will remain in full force.

              AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. IF YOU ARE NOT A NEW GRINDR USER,

            <li>  
              <u>Arbitration Opt-Out Procedure.</u>&nbsp;In order to opt-out,  
              within thirty-one (31) days after you accept the terms of this  
              agreement for the first time, You must email Your legal name,  
              mailing address (including street address, city, state, and zip  
              code), email address(es) associated with Your Account(s) to  
              which the opt-out applies, and an unaltered digital image of

              continue to apply to You.&nbsp;<strong>Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on  
                any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that You

            <li>  
              <u>WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS.</u>&nbsp;BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT,  
              YOU AND GRINDR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND  
              STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A  
              JUDGE OR A JURY (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED  
              ABOVE. YOU ALSO AGREE THAT YOU CANNOT SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE,  
              AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE  
              CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS,  
              IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING FILED AGAINST US  
              AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES, EVEN IF ARBITRATION IS NOT  
              REQUIRED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SUBSECTION  
              9 OF THIS SECTION ABOVE. You and Grindr are instead electing  
              that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this  
              arbitration provision, except as specified in subsection 9  
              above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court  
              review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited  
              review. This subsection does not prevent You or Grindr from  
              participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR YOUR CLAIMS.</u>&nbsp;You and Grindr

              this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration  
              within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or  
              controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you  
              agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to  
              such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of  
              limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent  
              jurisdiction.

              Grindr respects intellectual property rights and expects its  
              Users to do the same. Grindr will promptly terminate without  
              notice the accounts of Users that are determined by Grindr to be  
              “repeat infringers.” A repeat infringer is a User who has been  
              notified by Grindr of infringing activity violations more than  
              twice and/or who has had a User Content removed from the Grindr  
              Services more than twice. (Note that we reserve the right to

            <li>  
              <u>Severability, Waiver of Agreement Provisions.</u>&nbsp;You and We  
              agree that if any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed  
              unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that  
              provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and  
              shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any  
              remaining provisions. A provision of this Agreement may be  
              waived only by a written instrument executed by the party  
              entitled to the benefit of such provision. The failure of any  
              party at any time to require performance of any provision of  
              this Agreement shall in no manner affect such party’s right&nbsp;at a  
              later time&nbsp;to enforce the same. A waiver of any breach of any  
              provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a  
              continuing waiver of other breaches of the same or other  
              provisions of this Agreement.

              will expire after fourteen (14) days from Your purchase of the  
              Grindr Premium Services. If You have benefitted from a free  
              trial, the cancellation period will expire fourteen (14) days

              cancel Your Grindr Premium Services during the fourteen (14) day

              before the cancellation period has expired. There are no

              the day on which We are informed about Your decision to cancel  
              Your Premium Services. We will issue the refund using the same

              <u>Cancellation Within 10-day Cancellation Period.</u>&nbsp;You have  
              the right to cancel Your Grindr Premium Services within ten (10)  
              days without giving any reason. The cancellation period will  
              expire after ten (10) days from Your purchase of the Grindr  
              Premium Services. If You have benefitted from a free trial, the  
              cancellation period will expire ten (10) days from the beginning  
              of Your free trial. To exercise the right to cancel Your Grindr  
              Premium Services during the ten (10) day cancellation  
              period,&nbsp;You&nbsp;must inform Us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)">[\[email protected\]](https://www.grindr.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)</a>&nbsp;of Your decision to cancel by a clear statement. We will  
              communicate to You an acknowledgment of receipt of such  
              cancellation by email without delay. To meet the cancellation  
              deadline, it is sufficient for You to send Your communication  
              concerning Your exercise of the right to cancel before the  
              cancellation period has expired. There are no separate  
              cancellation fees but there are no refunds except as provided  
              herein. We will refund You a pro-rata amount of the Premium  
              Services fee for the unused period of Your Premium Services. You  
              will still be required to pay a Premium Service fee for the  
              period of Your Premium Services until You communicated to Us  
              Your cancellation (excluding any free trial period where no  
              payment was taken), and We will therefore not refund You for  
              that portion of Your Premium Services. We will make the refund  
              without undue delay. We will issue the refund using the same  
              means of payment as You used for the initial transaction, unless  
              You have expressly agreed otherwise.  
            </li>  
            <li>  
              <u>Notice and Takedown Policy.</u>&nbsp;If You are a resident of  
              Argentina, the notice and takedown policy in section 23 will not  
              apply to You. Instead, in case You believe that any content  
              hosted on any Grindr Service produces damage to You and could be  
              considered as manifestly illegal, then You may submit a  
              notification to Grindr indicating the content in question and  
              providing documentation that proves Your identity as well as  
              detailing the damage caused by the content. Grindr will analyze  
              the claim and if the content is manifestly illegal (i.e.&nbsp;child  
              pornography, data that facilities the commission of a crime,  
              crime or racism references, etc.), then Grindr will proceed with  
              its takedown. Any other content that causes damage but cannot be  
              considered as manifestly illegal shall not be taken down by  
              Grindr unless You provide a judicial notification ordering the  
              takedown of the content in question. Notifications of any sort  
              for these purposes shall be delivered to

              seven (7) day cancellation period,&nbsp;You&nbsp;must inform Us at

              will make the refund without undue delay and within the shortest  
              timeframe possible after the day on which We are informed about  
              Your decision to cancel. We will issue the refund using the same

              displayed on Your mobile screen, so that You may either (i)

              limitation of liability established under this Agreement may,&nbsp;as  
              a general rule, not apply to You, as the obligation to indemnify  
              is a rule of public order in Brazil. You and We are aware that

              damages, but solely the effective losses and the loss of profits  
              directly and immediately caused by it.
