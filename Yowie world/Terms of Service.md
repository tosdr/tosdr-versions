### Jurisdictional Issues and Dispute Resolution

The offices of our parent company are located in Perth, Australia. You are responsible for compliance with local laws in the place from which you access this website, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. This User Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Western Australia, Australia, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. If the arbitration and dispute resolution provisions of this User Agreement are not enforceable, you agree that, except as set forth below, any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this User Agreement shall be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Western Australia.

### Dispute Resolution:

If you have any questions or concerns relating to this Website, they can be sent to the attention of our Customer Service Representative at the address on our “Contact Us” page. You may also contact us by email at [\[email protected\]](https://yowieworld.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Should we be unable to resolve the issue, the following rules may apply to any dispute.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS SECTION PROVIDES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF MOST DISPUTES OR CLAIMS THROUGH ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF COURT TRIALS AND CLASS ACTIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY; ARBITRATION IS FINAL, BINDING, AND SUBJECT TO ONLY VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. THIS SECTION GOVERNING DISPUTES WILL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS USER AGREEMENT.

Mandatory Arbitration – YOU AND WE AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, EXCEPT THAT YOU OR WE MAY BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN ANY COURT OF APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. TO INITIATE ARBITRATION, YOU OR WE MUST FIRST SEND A WRITTEN NOTICE, VIA CERTIFIED MAIL, TO THE OTHER PARTY INDICATING AN INTENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH WILL INCLUDE: (1) A DESCRIPTION OF THE FACTS; (2) A DESCRIPTION OF THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM; AND (3) THE RELIEF SOUGHT (”NOTICE TO ARBITRATE”). SEND NOTICE TO ARBITRATE TO: C/O YOWIE GROUP LIMITED, ATTN: COMPANY SECRETARY, LEVEL 9, 190 ST GEORGES TERRACE, PERTH WA, 6000 AUSTRALIA. BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO MAKE REASONABLE ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; HOWEVER, IF THE PARTIES CANNOT RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WITHIN FORTY-FIVE (45) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF NOTICE TO ARBITRATE, THEN AN ARBITRATION CLAIM MAY COMMENCE. ANY ARBITRATION INITIATED UNDER THIS USER AGREEMENT WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATIONAL ARBITRATION RULES OR THE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION RULES, AS APPLICABLE, AS SUCH RULES MAY BE MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. THE LANGUAGE TO BE USED IN THE ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE ENGLISH AND THE PLACE OF ARBITRATION WILL BE PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA.

ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE NEUTRAL MUTUALLY AGREED UPON BY BOTH PARTIES ARBITRATOR OR, OTHERWISE, AN ARBITRATOR SELECTED BY THE AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION. YOU AND WE FURTHER AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATOR WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AWARD ANY RELIEF OR REMEDY IN EXCESS OF OR CONTRARY TO WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THIS USER AGREEMENT, EXCEPT WHERE SUCH PROVISION IS NOT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION AND AWARD WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED INTO ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION. THE LAW THAT IS APPLIED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT ALSO WILL BE APPLIED IN ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. THE COST OF ARBITRATION SHALL BE PAID FOR AS DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR.

Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Actions – BY ENTERING INTO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOU AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT, TO RECEIVE A JURY TRIAL, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLAIM ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU AND WE BOTH AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT A CONSOLIDATED, CLASS-WIDE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO PROCEED WITH AN ARBITRATION ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. IF FOR ANY REASON THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE SET FORTH IN THIS USER AGREEMENT IS DEEMED INAPPLICABLE OR INVALID, OR TO THE EXTENT THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE ALLOWS FOR LITIGATION OF DISPUTES IN COURT, YOU AND WE BOTH WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLAIM ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any provision of this User Agreement which is held null, void or otherwise ineffective or invalid by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be restated by such arbitrator or court to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the Parties, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this User Agreement.
