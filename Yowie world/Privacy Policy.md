The information that we collect is dependent on how you use the facilities offered on the Website. If you visit an unsecure area of the Website (that is, an area where you are not required to log on) to read, browse or download information, our system will record the date and time of your visit, the pages viewed, and any information downloaded. However, our systems will not record any personal information.

If you use any of the games available on the Website, we generally do not capture any personal information that you may enter when playing those games.

In that case the information is stored on our systems to allow you to rejoin the game at the same point.

If you decide to complete an online form, we will only collect the information that you enter into the online form if you submit the form. If at any stage you cancel the entry before submitting it, or you log out prior to submitting the form, the information you have entered up to that point will automatically be deleted.
