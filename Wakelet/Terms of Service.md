If you are a school, educational institution or club or similar entity who is accessing Wakelet as a Registered User on behalf of multiple potential users (whether adults or children), you will be referred to in these Terms as a “Registered Group User” or collectively “Registered Group Users”. All other Registered Users will be referred to in these Terms as “Registered Individual Users” and each a “Registered Individual User”.

Where a terms applies equally to Registered Group Users and Registered Individual Users, there will be no differentiation and “you” shall apply to both categories of Registered Users (and, where the context permits, Users).

Changes to the Terms
--------------------

Wakelet reserves the right to revise and update these Terms from time to time. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of Wakelet thereafter. If you are a Registered User, we will usually notify you of any changes via email and/or by asking you to review the changes to these Terms the next time you login to Wakelet. Your continued use of Wakelet after the time the changes are communicated will indicate your acceptance of those revised changes, so please check the Terms periodically for updates.

Privacy
-------

Your privacy is very important to us. Any information that you provide to Wakelet and which we collect about you is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information.

You acknowledge through your use of Wakelet that you have read and understood the terms of our Privacy Policy and agree with how we will use your information to provide Wakelet to you.

Changes to Service
------------------

We have the right to withdraw or revise Wakelet, and any service or material we provide on Wakelet, in our sole discretion and without notice, this will usually be to reflect our Registered Users' and Users' needs, our business priorities and developments of Wakelet.

We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of Wakelet is unavailable at any time or for any period. At any time we may restrict access to some parts of the site, or the entire site, to Users and Registered Users.

Accessing Wakelet And Account Security
--------------------------------------

You are responsible for:

* Making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to Wakelet.
    
* Ensuring that all persons who access Wakelet through your Internet connection are aware of these Terms and comply with them.
    

By using Wakelet, whether as a Registered User or as a User, you represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit as part of the Wakelet registration process is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of this information; (c) unless you are part of a Sponsored Group, you are thirteen (13) years of age or older if a User or Registered Individual and you are eighteen (18) years of age or older if you are a Group Registered user; and (d) your use of Wakelet does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Your Wakelet account may be deleted without notification if we have reason to believe that you do not meet these eligibility requirements.

When you sign up to become a Registered User of Wakelet, you will be asked to choose a username and a password for your account, or Wakelet may assign a password to you that you may change. Alternatively we may allow you to use a third-party account and authorisation service (for example, Microsoft or Google) in order to use Wakelet, and by using a third-party 's terms of use, privacy policy and any other agreement between you and them.

You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, you must treat such information as confidential, and you should not disclose it to any other person or entity.

Unless you are a Group Registered User and have agreed to and comply with these Terms in full, you also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to Wakelet or portions of it using your user name, password or other security information. For the avoidance of doubt, where you are a Group Registered User you should not share your username or password with any other person but we may permit you to allow other individuals access to Wakelet using your account, strictly in accordance with these Terms. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. Wakelet cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.

You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. Subject to the foregoing, you should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.

We have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms. If we do disable your account, you shall not create another account without our permission.

### Billing, Payments, Cancellations and Refunds

If you decide to upgrade to one of Wakelet's paid plans, you agree to the following payment terms and conditions. In the case of an Education or Education Pro subscription, these terms may be superseded by those stated in your quote, or final contract with Wakelet.

### Billing and Payment

Individual Pro - you will be billed from the date you convert to a Individual Pro account and on each renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your account. Wakelet will automatically bill your credit card on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your plan each month if on the monthly subscription, or annually if on the annual subscription. All fees and charges are pre-paid for the month or year ahead.

Education and Education Pro - your school, district or organization will be invoiced in full on commencement of your annual contract, with the payment terms as stated in your quote and/or contract documentation.

### Cancellation and Refunds

Individual Pro - users can cancel their Individual Pro account at any time by visiting their Settings area in their account and choosing the downgrade option to move back to the free, Individual plan. For users on a monthly billing option, the paid features will continue to be available until the end of the monthly billing period, at which time the account will be downgraded and access to paid features will cease. There are no refunds available for partial months. For users on an annual subscription, access to paid features will cease at the end of the relevant month, and a refund will be issued for any remaining complete months to the end of the annual billing period.

Education and Education Pro - all fees and charges are pre-paid and nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. For any questions relating to paid Wakelet accounts, please contact us directly at [support@wakelet.com](mailto:support@wakelet.com), or if on one of our Education plans, please speak to your Customer Success Manager.

### School Use and Children:

It is acceptable for children to access Wakelet via the Classrooms feature, which ensures that their accounts remain in a private 'Classroom', monitored by their teachers. Classrooms are part of our Education and Education Pro plans as well as legacy user accounts.

Wakelet does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 unless and until the School has obtained appropriate parental consent for the student to use the Service. Because Wakelet collects and uses Student Data at the direction of and under the control of a School, Wakelet relies on School Consent when children are using the Wakelet service via the classroom feature. Please contact us at [DPManager@wakelet.com](mailto:DPManager@wakelet.com) if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child under 13 without proper consent so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.

If you are the sponsor of a Sponsored Group (the “Sponsor”), including a School that is using Wakelet, that includes children under the age of 13, you (or your school) with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), Schools may under appropriate circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission's website at [http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm). If you are outside of the United States, please ensure that you are complying with any laws applicable to you before submitting any child's personal information or permitting any child to submit personal information to us. If a school outside the United States wants to enable its students to use Wakelet, Wakelet will work with such schools on a case by case basis to ensure compliance with any applicable laws regarding the collection of information from minors.

------------------------------

You may link to Wakelet's homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it.

You must not establish a link to Wakelet in any way as to suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement on our part where none exists.

Wakelet provides a facility which enables Registered Users to establish a frame on your website. You shall comply with any directions provided by us in connection with such frame. Where such a frame is established, you hereby warrant that the website to which you are creating a frame:

We reserve the right to, in our discretion and as we think fit, remove any frames or other links from any third party website without notice.

Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination
---------------------------------------

We do not moderate Wakelet. However, we take the violation of these Terms very seriously (this includes discrimination on individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or disease). In order to support this policy, we allow you to flag Content that you may deem to be inappropriate or in violation of our Terms. Reporting Content or a User or Registered User violation does not guarantee that the Content or the User/Registered User will be removed. The Wakelet users are very varied and everyone is different, what may be acceptable to one person may be unacceptable to another. We encourage discussions, ideas and freedom of speech. It is possible that something could be displeasing or troubling to you but does not meet the criteria for removal. However, any Content that violates the Wakelet Terms may be removed from Wakelet and, where appropriate, be subject to legal or other action. In any case, the person reported is not notified of the identity of the person who made the report.

Wakelet uses content filtering technology to flag content that may violate our Terms or Rules of Use. If these filters detect content that violates our Terms this content will be prevented from being made public and searchable by others.

You must not establish a link to Wakelet in any way as to suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement on our part where none exists.

If you are concerned about any Content on Wakelet then please notify us at [support@wakelet.com](mailto:support@wakelet.com). We are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any Interactive Service we may provide on Wakelet, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any Interactive Service by a User or Registered User in contravention of our Rules, whether the Interactive Service is moderated or not.

We have the right to:

* Remove or refuse to post any User Content for any or no reason in our sole discretion.
    
* Take any action with respect to any User Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Content violates the Terms, including the Rules, infringes any intellectual property rights, privacy rights or other rights of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of Wakelet or the public or could create liability for us.
    
* Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.
    
* Terminate or suspend your access to all or part of Wakelet for any reason, including without limitation, any violation of these Terms.
    

Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting Content on or through Wakelet. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS US AND OUR AFFILIATES, LICENSEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY US OR ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER US/SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

We do not undertake to review all Content before it is posted on Wakelet, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable Content after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications or content provided by any User, Registered User or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or non-performance of the activities described in this section.

Content Rules
-------------

We have rules on what is and is not appropriate Content, and you agree not to post User Comments or submit User Content, or otherwise use your account in violation of the Wakelet Content Rules. You also agree that, if you are in a country subject to an economic embargo by the United Kingdom or are otherwise a designated individual with whom the United Kingdom prohibits dealing with, you will not engage in commercial activity on or though the use of Wakelet.

Reliance On Information Posted
------------------------------

We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content, User Comments or communications posted via Wakelet or endorse any opinions expressed via Wakelet. You understand that by using Wakelet, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabelled or are otherwise deceptive.

We therefore disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by any User or Registered User or any other user of Wakelet, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its Contents.

1. Student records obtained by Wakelet from an educational institution continue to be the property of and under the control of the educational institution. The educational institution retains full ownership rights to the personal information and education records it provides to Wakelet.
    
    Wakelet users may retain possession and control of their own generated content by choosing whether a collection is public, private or unlisted. You can also manage your content when logged into your account, or request that we do so for you.

    Wakelet will not use any information in a student record for any purpose other than those required or specifically permitted by the Wakelet Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
    
    Parents, legal guardians, or eligible students may review personally identifiable information in the student's records and correct erroneous information by contacting their educational institution. Additionally, Wakelet users may access, correct, update, or delete personal information in their profile by signing into their Wakelet account, and making the appropriate changes.
    
    Wakelet is committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of student records. Towards this end, we take the following actions: (a) we limit employee access to student data to only those employees with a need to such access to fulfill their job responsibilities; (b) we conduct background checks on our employees that may have access to student data; (c) we conduct regular employee privacy and data security training and education; and (d) we protect personal information with technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards in order to protect against unauthorized access, release or use.
