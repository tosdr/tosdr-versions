EvergreenTech.io will treat all data associated with the termination of an account as outlined in the above section 5.II.

### 11\. Resource Usage Limitations

Please realize that these policies are in place to protect our clients (you) from poor service. Typically, if we have to impose a restriction on an account for resource usage, that account is already in violation of several aspects of the EvergreenTech.io TOS, and not just these usage policies. Most clients who fall into this realm affect at least two of these policies, and if left unchecked would begin adversely affecting other clients on their server. The overwhelming majority of sites will never have to take these limits into consideration. That being said, it is important they are in place and it is important you are aware of them.

EvergreenTech.io uses soft limits to enforce most of these limitations. These limits do not “kill” your service when reached, but rather set off a series of notifications in motion to notify us of potential issues. Many clients will find that they can exceed many or even most without receiving a notice from us. The issue becomes when a single account starts to affect the performance of an entire server, it is then necessary to have these limits in place. EvergreenTech.io has been known to give extensive leeway to folks who need it, providing them time to work with us to reduce the overall load or if not possible, enter discussions for a potential upgrade. With our highly optimized servers, it is rare we ever have to suspend a client for abuse, but under the EvergreenTech.io TOS, we do reserve the right to do so if excessive.

### 12\. Price Change

EvergreenTech.io reserves the right to change the prices and plans listed throughout the EvergreenTech.io website in addition to the resources allocated to each of the EvergreenTech.io plans at its own discretion. Further, EvergreenTech.io has the right to end and/or refuse any promotional codes for any reason.

### 13\. Auto Billing (Recurring Payments)

For convenience and to prevent an interruption in service, EvergreenTech.io has employed a reoccurring billing cycle on most monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual plans. If you do not want reoccurring payments on your account it is necessary to notify EvergreenTech.io at least seven (7) days prior to the payment taking place. Failure on your part to notify EvergreenTech.io of your intention to not be billed on a reoccurring basis will automatically result in your account being billed as originally agreed. If you are using PayPal subscriptions, it is your responsibility to cancel with PayPal directly.

### 14\. Bandwidth Usage

When purchasing you selected a monthly bandwidth allowance based on the package chosen. It is your sole responsibility to be aware of such limitations and will not hold EvergreenTech.io liable for any downtime experienced from account suspensions due to bandwidth overages. If overages are experienced or projected for a certain month, all EvergreenTech.io clientele have the option to upgrade to a larger plan or wait until the following month. Bandwidth usage is measured on a monthly basis coinciding with the Client’s billing cycle.
