Arlo Terms of Service
---------------------

Updated September 2, 2024 – These terms do not apply to Arlo customers using Arlo products and services in Europe.

Welcome to Arlo. Arlo is operated by Arlo Technologies, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” or “the Company”). We encourage you to read these Arlo Terms of Service (“Arlo Terms” or “Terms”) below. By accessing or using the Arlo Services, you indicate your consent to these Terms. The column on the right provides a short summary of some provisions of these Terms and is not legally binding.

These Terms apply to your use of any of our products or services including:

* (a) the Arlo hardware products, including without limitation, cameras, floodlights, video doorbells, base station devices, security systems, and sensors (referred to herein as the “Arlo System"); and/or
* (b) the Arlo websites and any associated subscriptions, content services, accounts, mobile apps, streaming video sites, technical support and services accessible via Arlo websites, Arlo Total Security financing plans, all other web services, and software associated with the Arlo System (collectively referred to as the “Arlo Websites and Apps”).
* (c) (a) and (b) above being collectively referred to herein as the "Arlo Services."

#### Essentially,

Please read these Terms as they are a legally binding agreement between you and Arlo. This column provides a short summary of some provisions of these Terms and is not legally binding.

PLEASE NOTE THAT SECTION 6 CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US. EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 6, THIS PROVISION REQUIRES THAT DISPUTES BE RESOLVED SOLELY THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION OR CLASS ACTION.

The arbitration provisions in these Terms do NOT apply retroactively or to latent claims that have accrued prior to the introduction of these arbitration provisions (August 26, 2020) but not raised or filed yet.

IF YOU SIGN UP FOR ANY ARLO SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, YOU FURTHER AGREE, AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 11, THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION MAY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE SAME APPLICABLE TERM AND PRICE, UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, INCLUDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 11.2.

#### Essentially,

Section 6 contains additional information on your legal rights which require mandatory arbitration of disputes. If you sign up for any subscription services, these may automatically renew until you cancel.

Age: You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Arlo Services. If you are at least 13 years old and under the age of 18 (“Minor”) you may use the Arlo Services only with the consent and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a Minor, you consent to these Terms on their behalf and are fully responsible for their acts in relation to the Arlo Services. If you are under 13, do not attempt to register for the Arlo Services or send any information about yourself to us.

#### Essentially,

You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Arlo Services. If you are 13 to 17 years of age, you must have consent and supervision from your parent or legal guardian to use the Arlo Services.

##### 1\. General

  

Your registration of the Arlo System through the Arlo Websites and Apps as well as use of the Arlo Services is subject to the provisions of these Terms. Arlo may at its discretion make changes to its website, policies, and terms and conditions, including these Terms. Arlo may provide you with notices regarding the Arlo Services, including changes to these Terms, by email to your email address on file with Arlo, by in-app messaging, by SMS, by regular mail, by postings on our website and/or the Arlo Service, or by other reasonable means now known or hereinafter developed. If you are dissatisfied with any changes to these Terms, you may cancel your Arlo Services in accordance with Section 14 of these Terms. Your use of the Arlo Services on or after the effective date of the change to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the Terms, as modified. Any software component embodied in the Arlo Services is licensed to you, and not sold. Arlo Services cannot be used in the comprehensively sanctioned countries of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, and the Arlo System should not be sold in these countries.

You agree that you will only use the Arlo Services for your personal and business purposes, and that you are not immediately reselling the Arlo Services or sub-licensing use of the Arlo Services to others as part of a trade, business, craft, or profession.

#### Essentially,

Your registration and use of the Arlo Services is subject to the provisions of these Terms. You agree that you will only use the Arlo Services for your personal or business purposes and that you are not reselling or sub-licensing the Arlo Services as part of a trade, business, craft or profession.

Arlo may terminate your account if you provide Arlo with inaccurate or incomplete user information. You also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the Arlo Services. These Terms are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Arlo Services is revoked where prohibited by law.

Arlo may collect, process, and store your videos and other information. Please review our [Privacy Notice](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/about/privacy-policy/) for details about how we collect, use, disclose, and retain information about you and your Arlo account. We encourage you to review the Privacy Notice frequently. You have the right to update your user information at any time. You may also be able to manage privacy settings related to collection, storage, and use of your user information and other types of information captured by the Arlo Services. Any such changes can be made by logging into your Arlo account. However, certain features of the Arlo Services may not be available if you restrict the collection, storage, or use of your information.

You are fully responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the information required to access or make modifications to your account (e.g. passwords, PINs, verification codes), as well as for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to properly protect your account by, for example, exiting from or logging out of your account at the end of each session, by implementing two or multi-factor authentication if requested by Arlo, and by not sharing your password or two or multi-factor verification code. You further undertake to immediately notify us of unauthorized use of your password or account. In the event Arlo suspects fraudulent activity, we may suspend access to your account and Arlo Services or reset your passwords, pursuant to our security policies to prevent unauthorized access. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 3.

We may close your Arlo account if there is a justified reason to do so, such reason including if you are in breach of applicable laws, these Terms, applicable contractual provisions, or our guidelines or policies. We may also close your account if you demonstrate abusive behavior, your account is inactive for an extended period, or we are required to under a court order or governmental decree. You generally will have access to content and Arlo Services purchased by you up to the point of account closure.

#### Essentially,

You are fully responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the information required to access or make modifications to your account and for all activities that occur under your password or account. Arlo will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the requirements of this section. We reserve the right to close your Arlo account if there is a justified reason to do so. We may also close your account if your account is inactive for an extended period or if we are required to under a court order or governmental decree.

##### 4\. Third-Party Content

  

The Arlo Services may give you the ability to access, use or integrate directly with third-party websites, apps, products, content, or other media controlled by third parties ("Third-Party Content"). You confirm to understand the following:

* (a) Third-Party Content providers may restrict or revoke access to their content at any time;
* (b) We do not operate, control or endorse any Third-Party Content and are not responsible for and have no editorial or programming control over any Third-Party Content. Further, we do not guarantee the safety, accuracy, legality, and effectiveness of the Third-Party Content, and will have no responsibility for any Third-Party Content including material that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable; and
* (c) We have no control over the distribution of Third-Party Content.

You agree that we will have no liability to you or anyone else who uses your Arlo Services with regard to any Third-Party Content. You also agree and declare that Third-Party Content accessed or transferred using the Arlo Services is for your own personal or business use, and that the Arlo Services will not be used to illegally copy, illegally display, commercialize, or otherwise make illegal use of Third-Party Content. Unauthorized copying or distribution of copyrighted works may constitute an infringement of the copyright holders' rights. You agree to assume all risks in connection with your interaction or use of any Third-Party Content. You are responsible for reading and understanding the terms and conditions and privacy notice or privacy policy that applies to your use of Third-Party Content.

We may close the accounts of users of any Arlo Services that infringe the copyrights, trademarks, or intellectual property rights of others. In addition, steps intended to defeat or bypass security measures designed to prevent intellectual property infringement may be illegal under U.S. law or comparable foreign laws. We may close the Arlo accounts of users who develop or use methods to defeat or bypass such security measures and may take any other necessary or appropriate action to prevent infringement of intellectual property holders' rights.

#### Essentially,

The Arlo Services may give you the ability to access, use or integrate with third parties over which we exercise no editorial or programming control. You agree that we will have no liability to you or anyone else who uses your Arlo Services, with regard to any Third-Party Content. We may close the accounts of users of any Arlo Service or software who infringe the copyrights, trademarks, or intellectual property rights of others or who develop or use methods to defeat or bypass security measures.

##### 5\. Changes to Your Arlo Service

  

We may change any part of the Arlo Services at any time, including without limitation for the following reasons: for legal or regulatory reasons; for security reasons; for privacy reasons; to enhance existing features; to add additional features or functionality; to remove features or functionality; to prevent misuse or abuse; to reflect changes or advancements in technology; to make business model adjustments; to make subscription fee changes; and to ensure the ongoing operability of the Arlo Services. If you reject these changes, you may cancel your subscription to the Arlo Services at any time, in accordance with Section 11.2. Regardless of any changes to the Arlo Services, any increase in the applicable subscription fee will not apply before the end of your current subscription period.

We are under no obligation to provide any or all features and functionality to your Arlo Services and may, at our discretion, discontinue the provision of software updates to certain Arlo Services. Because different Arlo Systems may support different features and functionality, the level of service we provide may not be the same for each Arlo System.

#### Essentially,

We may make changes to the Arlo Service, at any time. In case we make material changes, we will inform you in due form to remind you of your rights.

##### 6\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH AGREEING TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND ARE THEREFORE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

BINDING ARBITRATION. To the extent possible under your local law, both you and the Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims out of or relating to this Agreement, any Arlo Services, or your relationship to Arlo. All disputes concerning whether a claim is subject to arbitration (including disputes about the interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of this Agreement) will be decided by the arbitrator. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury to resolve claims. Arbitration is less formal than a traditional court proceeding and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.

The arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and consumer contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. In the event 10 (ten) or more demands for arbitration that share common factual or legal issues are filed by the same counsel or counsel acting in coordination with one another, the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines then in effect, including as related to initial filing fees, will also apply. The right to arbitration under this Agreement is protected by, and any arbitration will also be governed by, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.). Both parties agree that the parties’ relationship involves interstate commerce. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.

Specifically excluded from application to these Terms is that law known as the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party will have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, for any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.

CLASS ACTION WAIVER. The parties agree that they both give up the right to a jury trial, and that each may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit: CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.

THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER ARE OPTIONAL. You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to [legal@arlo.com](mailto:legal@arlo.com) within thirty (30) calendar days of agreeing to these Terms.

#### Essentially,

You agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims with Arlo on an individual basis and not through a class arbitration or class action. When applicable, you agree that the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines will also apply. To decline or opt out of this arbitration Agreement, you must send a written and signed notice to [legal@arlo.com](mailto:legal@arlo.com) within 30 calendar days of agreeing to these Terms.

##### 7\. Service Eligibility

  

Use of the Arlo Services requires that your Arlo System has access to an always-on, broadband internet connection, in accordance with Section 12. To enable the Arlo Services, all Arlo Systems must be registered at [my.arlo.com](https://my.arlo.com/account/v4/#/login) or the Arlo apps, such as the official Arlo iOS and Android apps.

The Services will not be accessible without: (i) Wi-Fi or other communications network in your home that is positioned to communicate reliably with the Arlo System; (ii) an Arlo account; (iii) for some features and functionalities of the Arlo Services, an enabled and supported wireless device, such as a phone or tablet; (iv) always-on broadband Internet access with bandwidth sufficient to support the Arlo System you use; and (v) other system elements that may be specified by Arlo. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all required system elements and that they are compatible and properly configured.

Arlo is not obligated to make any updates available. Specifically, Arlo may not make the same updates available to all Arlo Systems and may discontinue updates to products that have reached their Arlo-designated end of lives. Arlo does not guarantee that it will support the version of the system or device for which you purchased or licensed the software, apps, content, or other products. Arlo may stop supporting devices or operating systems that it previously supported.

#### Essentially,

Arlo may stop supporting devices or operating systems that it previously supported.

##### 8\. Member Conduct

  

You understand that all information, data, text, software, photographs, video, images, messages, tags, feedback, comments, questions, other information, or materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not us, are entirely responsible for all Content that you capture, save, upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available via the Arlo Services.

We do not have an obligation to monitor or control the Content posted via the Arlo Services and, as such, do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of such Content. Under no circumstances will we be liable for any Content, including but not limited to the following circumstances:

* (a) any errors or omissions in any Content;
* (b) any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Arlo Services including viewing, copying, or redistribution of the Content;
* (c) loss or destruction of Content; or
* (d) failure to comply with any and all applicable federal, state, and local laws with respect to Content or use of the Arlo Services, including but not limited to laws or regulations related to consent, closed-circuit television monitoring, recording communications – either audio or video, and facial recognition data or other custom detections derived from video recordings or uploaded photographs inclusive of any installation, notice, or consent requirements.

You also understand that we do not guarantee the identity of any other users with whom you may interact in the course of using the Arlo Services. Additionally, we do not guarantee the authenticity of any data that users may provide about themselves. We do not control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Arlo Services.

You agree not to use the Arlo Services to do the following: upload, post, email, transmit, use, or otherwise make available any Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, or that contains any private or personal information of another person without that person’s consent if such consent is legally required; harms any person; impersonates any person or entity; or forges headers or otherwise manipulates identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any Content transmitted through the Arlo Services. You agree not to upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any Content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under any contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information, proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements); infringes or misappropriates any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights ("Rights") of any party; or contains viruses, corrupted data, or other harmful, disruptive, or destructive files or content. You agree not to upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail, "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," or any other form of solicitation; interfere with or disrupt the Arlo Services or servers or networks connected to the Arlo Services (including without limitation denial-of-service attacks); disobey any requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of networks connected to the Arlo Services; violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law and any regulations having the force of law; "stalk" or otherwise harass another; or use any data mining, robots, or similar data gathering or extraction methods designed to scrape or extract data from the Arlo Services; use measures to bypass location based restrictions; develop or use any applications that interact with the Arlo Services without our prior written consent; or use any non-Arlo branded device with any Arlo Services unless we have specifically designated it as compatible.

Our personnel do not view your private photographs or videos without your permission unless compelled by law. We may also refuse or remove Content from the Arlo Services that may violate the Terms, such as those prohibitions listed in this Section 8.

Without limiting the foregoing, we will have the right at any time to remove any Content that violates these Terms, is illegal, or that we believe may be illegal or inappropriate (including, but not limited to, removal upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content).

You will be responsible for withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Arlo Services. You acknowledge that Arlo may, in accordance with its [Privacy Notice](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/about/privacy-policy/), access, preserve, and disclose your account information and/or Content if required to do so by law or in a belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

* (a) comply with legal process, including without limitation subpoenas and search warrants;
* (b) enforce these Terms;
* (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties;
* (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or
* (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Arlo, its users, and the public.

You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Arlo Services, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.

Arlo may at its discretion implement certain data consumption thresholds or other data usage plans for the Arlo Services to address excessive or abusive usage.

You understand that the Arlo Services and software embodied within the Arlo Services may include security components that permit digital materials to be protected and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by the Company and/or content providers who provide content to the Arlo Services. Arlo may require certain security safeguards in order to use the Arlo Services, such as two or multi-factor authentication.

You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Arlo Services.

#### Essentially,

You, and not Arlo, are entirely responsible for all Content that you capture, upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available via the Arlo Services.

You, and not Arlo, are responsible for complying with any local laws or regulations that relate to your use of the Arlo Services. This may include installation requirements. This may also include you providing notice and obtaining consent from people who may be monitored, recorded (audio or video), or otherwise identified such as through facial recognition or other custom detections derived from your Content.

Arlo has the right, at any time, to remove any Content that violates these Terms, is illegal, or that we believe may be illegal or inappropriate.

Our personnel do not view your private photographs or videos without your permission unless compelled by law.

##### 9\. Content Submitted or Made Available for Inclusion on the Arlo Services

  

Arlo does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available for inclusion on the Arlo Services. With respect to Content (including all related intellectual property rights) you submit or make available for the Arlo Services, you grant Arlo the following worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, and transferable license(s), as applicable: the license to use, store, delete, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, make derivative works of, publicly perform, and publicly display such Content on the Arlo Services and other third-party platforms in connection with providing you the Arlo Services, as permitted through the functionality of the Arlo Services and under these Terms. You grant Arlo the right to maintain a copy of the Content (including all related intellectual property rights) for archival and legal purposes.

You also hereby do and will grant each user of the Arlo Services a non-exclusive license to access and use your Content through the Arlo Services, as solely permitted through the functionality of the Arlo Services and directed by you and under these Terms.

The Arlo ER will not function (1) with the loss of critical electrical power, including without limitation the loss of power to equipment necessary to route Arlo Service Plan communications to the appropriate emergency call center; (2) if the wireless or broadband internet connection to your device with the Arlo Service Plan application is not operational; (3) at a remote location with no internet connection or other wireless coverage; (4) if the Arlo Service Plan application is not correctly configured; (5) if the correct physical address for the Arlo Service Plan is not provided; (6) if an emergency call center's technical limitations render it incapable of receiving or processing calls from the Arlo Service Plan; (7) if necessary permissions are not enabled for Arlo Service Plan features; (8) if the mobile device used for the Arlo Service Plan does not have the minimum battery life (9) if the mobile device does not properly transmit sensor or location signals and (10) other force majeure events cause the quality of the broadband connection to deteriorate, including without limitation network congestion. Your acceptance of these Arlo Service Plan terms constitutes your acknowledgement that Arlo has advised you of these potential limitations.

In the event of a life or safety hazard, risk of property damage, fire, flood, burglary, mugging, automobile crash, medical or other emergency, you should contact 911 or other appropriate emergency services immediately. Features of the Arlo Service Plans are NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR 911 OR CONTACTING EMERGENCY SERVICES OR RESPONDERS.

Emergency response may not function due to reasons described in the full Terms. Your acceptance of the Terms constitutes your acknowledgement that Arlo has advised you of these potential limitations.

In the event of a life or safety hazard, risk of property damage, fire, flood, burglary, mugging, automobile crash, medical or other emergency, you should contact 911 or other appropriate emergency services immediately. Features of the Arlo Service Plans are NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR 911.

Alerts and Notifications. Only in the event of an emergency and once the monitoring center receives an alarm from the alarm system, will Arlo take measures to, if necessary, (i) review and notify you of any video footage you authorize to be viewed by the monitoring team; (ii) initiate the deployment of the police, fire department and/or security service designated by Arlo and; (iii) notify you by telephone, SMS and/or e-mail and; (iv) notify your emergency or safety contact(s) by telephone or SMS. You agree to receive communications from us on your mobile device including calls, text messages, alerts, and other electronic communications. You understand your obligation to obtain consent from any person added by you to receive electronic communications related to your Arlo Services. Standard minute, message and data rates apply to all messages sent to or received from us. You understand that information you include in your Arlo ER Profile will be shared with police, fire, or emergency medical service providers (collectively, “Emergency Responders”). You understand and agree that once your Arlo ER Profile information is made available to Emergency Responders, it may be transmitted or otherwise made accessible through unsecured communications as part of the information disseminated to or by Emergency Responders responding to an emergency. You further understand that the information provided may be stored as part of a public record associated with an emergency call if required by local statutes. You understand and agree and hereby authorize Arlo to release and disclose your Arlo ER Profile information to Emergency Responders in connection with Arlo ER.

In providing the alarm monitoring and additional emergency services, Arlo is ¬dependent on third parties, the functioning of the ¬local network, the Internet, GPS and the GPRS network. You agree that you are aware of this and accept that Arlo has no control over this.

Arlo ER following Free Trial or Termination of Services. Some features of your Arlo ER will be unavailable at the end of the free trial period, if you do not purchase a paid Arlo subscription prior to the expiry of the free trial period, or if you change your subscription to one that does not provide that Arlo ER feature. Arlo ER will not be available if your account is suspended or terminated.

Customers’ Duty to Correctly Install and Maintain. It is your responsibility to install the Arlo security system and sensors, cameras, or other devices in strict accordance with the instructions and specifications provided to you. If these are improperly installed or not properly configured, or are outside the detection area or blocked by walls, furniture, personal property or other objects; then it could result in false sensor event triggers or errors in event detection or recording.

Sensors, sound detection and video-based fire detection are secondary measures and should not replace conventional alarms. As an example, your primary smoke detector triggers an alarm based on the presence of smoke that can then be heard through sound detection. And video-based fire detection systems cannot ensure that fire will be reliably detected in all scenery settings. It is your responsibility to inspect and maintain your Arlo security system and sensors, cameras and other devices after installation is complete and periodically thereafter. It is also your responsibility to replace the batteries when necessary. The Arlo ER may not work accurately, if batteries need replacement or servicing. Please check batteries regularly.

Automobile Crash Response. When crash detection is enabled, you understand that you must either be the driver of the vehicle or have obtained consent from the driver to use this feature. If you do not have consent, you understand that you must deactivate this feature on your device. Enabling this feature does not replace calling 911 in the event of a crash. Arlo ER endeavors to successfully detect and report an automobile collision, however you understand that not all collisions may be detected, and some non-collisions may be falsely reported as collisions (e.g. due to network issues, algorithm error, mobile device sensor errors, etc.).

Changes to System Elements. Note that if you replace or modify elements of the Arlo System (as described in the accompanying documentation), it may not transmit signals, causing malfunctions and missed events.

Limitation of Liability. We do not have any control over whether, or the manner in which, calls using our Arlo ER are answered or addressed by emergency response centers. We disclaim all responsibility for the conduct of any local, regional, or national emergency calling centers and emergency response centers. We may rely on suppliers, vendors, and third parties to assist us providing the Arlo ER and in routing communications to local, regional, or national emergency calling centers and emergency response centers. We disclaim any and all liability or responsibility in the event third party data used to route communications is incorrect, not sent, or yields an erroneous result. Arlo does not warrant or guarantee that the Arlo ER will detect and report all emergency situations, that false reports will not be made, or that emergency assistance will be provided in the event of an emergency situation (e.g. collisions, break-ins, water leakage, etc.). Neither Arlo nor its officers, employees, vendors, or suppliers may be held liable for any claim, damage, or loss, including without limitation consequential damages and lost profits, and you hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action arising from or relating to our subscriptions, including the Arlo ER, unless such claims or causes of action arise from our gross negligence or willful misconduct.

False Alarms. Government or municipal authorities may assess fines, penalties or other fees for false alarms, excessive alarms, or failing to comply with regulations or standards intended to reduce false alarms. You are responsible for any such fees that are assessed against you. You will indemnify and hold harmless Arlo for any such fees and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Additional Services. We may from time to time make additional Arlo services available to Arlo customers. In order to access such additional services, you may be required to take certain steps, including consent to further terms.
