Privacy Rights.In some places laws grant residents certain privacy rights related to their personal Information. Read on to learn more about the different rights.

_Right to Know and Data Portability/Access._ You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and processing of your Information. Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will disclose to you:

_Right to Delete._ You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal Information that you have provided or that we have collected and processed about you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will review your request to see if an exception requiring us to retain the Information applies. We will delete or deidentify personal Information not subject to one of these exceptions from our records to take similar action. You may delete most Information through your account settings by logging in [here](https://my.arlo.com/#/home) or though the mobile application.

_Right to Correct Inaccurate Information._ If we maintain inaccurate Information about you, you have the right to request correction of that inaccurate personal Information, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information and the purposes of the personal Information processing. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct this Information.

_Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Information._ Arlo limits the types of sensitive Information it collects, uses, and the purposes for which it might be disclosed in order to best protect your privacy. Arlo’s collection, use, and disclosure of sensitive Information falls into the limited business purposes permitted by and in compliance with applicable law.

_Right to Opt-In or Opt-Out of Sharing / Sale / Right to Object._ Arlo gives consumers the right to request to opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of (i) targeted or cross-contextual behavioral advertising, (ii) the sale of personal data, or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.

We do not exchange your Information for monetary consideration or share your Information with a third party to use for their own marketing purposes. We only engage in cross-contextual behavioral or targeted advertising through cookies and similar tracking technologies. Under certain U.S. state laws, these activities may be considered “sharing” or “selling.” We share, or have shared prior to the effective date of this Notice, identifiers such as a device ID, cookie ID, or IP address and internet/electronic network activity such as website pages visited with advertisers and advertising networks, data analytics providers and social networks through these technologies. To opt-out of this processing, we will rely on you to set your preferences regarding cookies and other tracking technologies. To do this, click on the Your Privacy Choices link in the footer of your browser.

This includes the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of privacy rights, including an employee’s, applicant’s, or independent contractor’s right not to be retaliated against for the exercise of their state law privacy rights.

_Financial Incentives._ We may offer financial incentives to individuals who provide their email address to sign up to receive marketing and promotional emails from us. The terms of the financial incentive will be presented to you at the time you sign up. You may withdraw from any of the financial incentives by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email messages or by contacting us as described at the end of this Notice. The value of providing your email address will vary and is based on the amount of the purchase using the initial offer and any subsequent offers received.

_Exercising Your Rights._ If you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, wishes to exercise these rights, please visit [here](https://my.arlo.com/#/home) to exercise these as possible through your account settings and Privacy Center or log into your mobile application. Otherwise access our online form [here](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/us-privacy-policy-form.html) or contact us at [privacy@arlo.com](mailto: privacy@arlo.com). You or your authorized agent may be limited to submit certain requests within a 12-month period. Your request must:

* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
* Provide sufficient Information, which will likely need to match with Information we previously collected from you, that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal Information or an authorized representative (“Authorized Agent”).

If you would like, you may designate an Authorized Agent to make a request on your behalf. We will deny requests from agents that do not submit proof of authorization from you. If you designate an Authorized Agent to make a request for you, we may require:

* A copy of a power of attorney or require that you provide the authorized agent with written permission.
* You to verify your own identity with us directly.

We will only use Information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make it, except for record-keeping purposes. We will delete this Information as soon as practicable, or until we no longer legally need the Information, after complying with the request.

_Response Timing and Format._ We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact [privacy@arlo.com](mailto: privacy@arlo.com).

We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Appeal Process. If you would like to submit an appeal for any decision with regard to any consumer request, please email [privacy@arlo.com](mailto: privacy@arlo.com).
