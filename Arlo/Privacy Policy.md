#### Nevada Residents

You may opt out of any future sale of your information to a third party by contacting us as described at the end of this Notice.

#### Notice of Financial Incentives

* * *

California law requires that we disclose specific information about the financial incentives we offer. Colorado requires that we provide similar information about loyalty programs that are offered to give individuals, among other things, “superior” goods or services. (This is defined in Colorado as a Bona Fide Loyalty Program). While we do not believe that any of Arlo’s programs qualify as a “Bona Fide Loyalty Program” under Colorado law we have nevertheless provided information that is required by that state’s law.

#### The Incentive and Its Terms

From time to time, we may offer financial incentives to promote our services. This might include coupons or promotion codes when you sign up for emails. It also might include features a customer would not typically have access to use unless they are an Arlo Secure Subscriber. We will ask you to provide information about yourself in connection with these programs. This may include contact information and billing information. It may also include your device advertising ID.

#### Price Difference and Value

It is not our business practice to assign a specific monetary value to personal information. However, California law requires that we assign a value. This statement outlines the value and how we have calculated it in the context of the financial incentives we offer.

The financial incentives we offer to consumers are reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data to our business. We calculate this in good faith based on our reasonable but sole determination using factors that include expenses we incur to collect, store, and keep personal information. We also considered the expenses related to providing the financial incentive.

#### Targeted Advertising

Colorado requires that we describe the categories of personal information that will be sold or processed for targeted advertising purposes in connection with a financial incentive program. For any program that we offer we will provide you with this information as required by law at the time that you sign up to participate in the program.

#### Choices

Participation in any financial incentive program is optional and California law gives you the right to withdraw from participating in financial incentives at any time. You can withdraw from receiving financial incentives at any time by submitting a request to [privacy@arlo.com](mailto:privacy@arlo.com) or adjusting your preferences within your account. Withdrawal may impact your ability to receive additional rewards or promotions.

#### Third Parties and Partners

Third parties who will receive personal and sensitive information collected in connection with the program are our business partners, vendors, and clients.

#### Transfers and Storage of Information

* * *

Arlo is based in the United States, which means the information we collect, including payment information, may be processed and stored within the United States. If you live outside of the United States and choose to use the Services, you understand that your information may be processed and/or stored outside your country of residence, including in other jurisdictions (like the United States) that may have different data protection frameworks than your country. Information we transfer from Europe to the United States is subject to appropriate safeguards under applicable law.

#### Children’s Privacy

* * *

Arlo does not direct our Services to children, and we do not knowingly collect information from children. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child has given us information, you can write to us or email us at the addresses provided at the end of this Notice. Please mark your inquiries “Parental Information Request.” If we learn we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected or received information from a child without appropriate consent, we will delete such information.

#### How We Protect Information
