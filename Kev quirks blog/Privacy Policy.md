Privacy
=======

1. [Analytics](#1)  
    1.1 [No Cookies](#1.1)
2. [Terms of Service](#2)
3. [License Information](#3)  
    3.1 [Attribution Example](#3.1)

Personally, [I have taken a number of steps](https://kevq.uk/tag:DeGoogling) to try and maintain my own privacy where possible. So I think I would be remiss if I didn't try and do the same for those who decide they want to come and read the content that I put out on this site.

Plus, it's actually the [law within the EU](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/).

With all of the above in mind, I want to do what I can to maintain the privacy of visitors to this site wherever possible. So what do I do to help ensure your privacy is maintained?

1\. Analytics
-------------

**The TL;DR is that there are no analytics on this site. You can [read more about that here](https://kevq.uk/chasing-visitors-the-web-analytics-rabbit-hole/) if youâ€™re interested.**

I don't care how many people read the content of this site, I only care about engagement - I'd rather have a single person email me, than 1 million visitors who never engage.

### 1.1 No Cookies

No tracking cookies will be dropped on to your machine from this website, which means [there is no unique ID that I can use to identify and track you](https://kevq.uk/how-online-tracking-works).

You can also use an online tool like [Cookie Metrix](https://www.cookiemetrix.com/) to see what cookies are stored on your machine when you visit my site.

_Spoiler - there are no cookies!_ ðŸ™‚
