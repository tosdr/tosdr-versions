Log Keeping Policy
==================

anonymous VPN provider

During our normal course of duties, we do not monitor, record or store logs for any single customers VPN activity. We **have** absolutely **No logs VPN** on:

* web traffic data
* websites visited
* files downloaded
* videos watched etc.

We will however record the following data:

1. time, date and location vpn connection was made
2. duration of the vpn connection
3. bandwidth used during the connection

This information is regularly cycled within our servers. This information enables LimeVPN to enforce our Terms of Service, spam, crimes using the service, etc. If there is a violation we will use these trace logs to determine which account is in violation. After lengthy analysis of this data, we will terminate the service and/or take further action. Under no circumstances we will provide any personal or private information to the third parties. We are located in the jurisdiction of Singapore. **Neither we nor third parties are technically possible to match an IP address to an account. Thus we are to be really [anonymous VPN provider](https://limevpn.com/anonymous-vpn/).**
