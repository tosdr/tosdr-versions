If any Service Terms are inconsistent with these Conditions of Use, the Service Terms will control.

LICENSE AND ACCESS
------------------

Subject to your full compliance with these Conditions of Use and any applicable Service Terms, and your payment of any applicable fees, 6pm grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and fully revocable license to access and make personal, non-commercial use of the 6pm Services. For 6pm.com specifically, the license to access 6pm.com is solely for the purpose of shopping for items for personal use sold on 6pm.com and not for any commercial use or use on behalf of any third party, except as explicitly permitted by us in advance and in our sole discretion. The license granted herein does not include: any resale or commercial use of any 6pm Service, or its contents; any collection or use of any product listings, descriptions, images, or prices; any derivative use of any 6pm Service or its contents; any downloading, copying, or other use of account information for the benefit of any third party; or any use of data mining, robots (bots), or similar data gathering and extraction tools.

All rights not expressly granted to you in these Conditions of Use or any Service Terms are reserved and retained by 6pm or its licensors, suppliers, publishers, rightsholders, or other content providers. No 6pm Service, nor any part of any 6pm Service, may be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without express written consent of 6pm. You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of 6pm without express written consent. You may not use any meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing 6pm’s name or trademarks without the express written consent of 6pm. 6pm reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, and/or cancel orders in our sole discretion, including, without limitation, if we believe that customer conduct violates these Conditions of Use, applicable law, or is harmful to our interests.

RISK OF LOSS, RETURNS/REFUNDS & TITLE
-------------------------------------

The risk of loss and title for items purchased by you from 6pm pass to you upon our delivery of the items to the carrier. Conversely, we do not take title to returned items until the item is received at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, we do not take title to the refunded item. You are responsible for reviewing the contents of your returns prior to shipment back to us.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS; TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS; SITE CONTENT
--------------------------------------------------------

6pm attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, 6pm does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any 6pm Service is 100% accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by 6pm is not as described, your sole remedy against us is to return it in unused condition and request a refund for such item. If any other 6pm Service is not as described, your sole remedy against us is to request a refund for such 6pm Service.

In the event a product or service is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information (due to typographical error or error in pricing or product information received from our suppliers), we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for such product or service. We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.

Content provided on 6pm.com is solely for informational purposes. It is your sole responsibility to consult a licensed physician or qualified health care professional for advice, diagnosis, and/or treatment of any health related condition or before engaging in any physical activity using our products or services.

TERMINATION AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION
-------------------------------------

In addition to any other legal or equitable remedies, we may, without prior notice to you, immediately terminate or revoke any or all of your permissions granted under these Conditions of Use. Upon such termination or revocation, you shall immediately cease all access to and use of all 6pm Services, and we shall, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies, immediately revoke all password(s) and account identification issued to you and deny your access to and use of 6pm.com or any other 6pm website in whole or in part. Any termination of these Conditions of Use shall not affect the respective rights and obligations (including without limitation, payment obligations) of the parties arising before the date of termination.

DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
--------------------------------------

6PM SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) AND OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH 6PM SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY 6PM ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. 6PM MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF 6PM SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH 6PM SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.

TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, 6PM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DATA ACCURACY, DATA SECURITY, AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 6PM.COM MAY INCLUDE INACCURACIES, MISTAKES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. 6PM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT 6PM SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH 6PM SERVICES,6PM’S SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM 6PM ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, 6PM WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY 6PM SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY 6PM SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES (REGARDLESS OF THE FOUNDATION FOR THE ACTION) SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US FOR THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT OR SERVICE.

DISPUTES, REMEDIES & APPLICABLE LAW
-----------------------------------

**Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any 6pm Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by 6pm or through 6pm.com or any other 6pm website will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.** You agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Nevada (without regard to principles of conflict of laws), will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and 6pm.

**There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.**

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent CSC Services of Nevada, Inc., 2215-B Renaissance Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The AAA's rules will govern payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Clark County, Nevada or at another mutually agreed location.

**You and 6pm both agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.** If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration **you and 6pm each respectively waive any right to a jury trial.** You and 6pm also both agree that either of us may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

MODIFICATION & SEVERABILITY
---------------------------

We reserve the right to make changes to our websites, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time and without notice to you. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.
