Security Disclosure Policy

_Last updated: November 7th, 2020_

We greatly appreciate investigative work into security vulnerabilities carried out by well-intentioned, ethical, security researchers. We follow the practice of [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) in order to best protect our user base from the impact of security issues. On our side, this means:

* We will respond to security incidents as a priority.
* We will work with you to establish a disclosure time frame for the reported vulnerability. During this time frame, we will either work on a fix or decide to accept the risk, after which we will disclose the vulnerability.
* We will always transparently let our community know about any incidents that affect them.

In general, we will aim for a fix within 120 days of processing your report, but we may propose a longer time frame (usually 180 days) for especially complex vulnerabilities. In some cases, when a vulnerability is particularly disruptive and/or easy to exploit, we may delay publishing technical details for an additional period after the fix is publicly available (usually no longer than 30 days).

If you have found a security vulnerability in t2bot.io or the software we maintain, we ask thay you disclose it reponsibly by messaging [@travis:t2l.io](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) on Matrix. Please do not discuss potential vulnerabilities in public or near-public without first validating with us.

On receipt, we will:

* Review the report, verify the vulnerability, and respond with confirmation or for more information. We typically reply within 24 hours.
* Once the security bug has been addresses we will notify the Researcher, who is then welcome to optionally disclose publicly.

Please note that although t2bot.io is built off Matrix, we cannot reasonably take the lead on resolving incidents relating to the protocol. If an issue is determined to be an issue with the Matrix protocol, we will report it upstream to the Matrix team per their [security disclosure policy](https://matrix.org/security-disclosure-policy/). We will respond to the original reporter to indicate that their report has been proxied to the Matrix team, and, if desired, disclose the reporter to the Matrix team for appropriate credit and information gathering. Similar programs apply for software t2bot.io depends on, such as bridges and bots not authored by us directly.

We do not currently provide a bug bounty program. We maintain a Hall of Fame to recognize those who have responsibly disclosed security issues to us in the past.
