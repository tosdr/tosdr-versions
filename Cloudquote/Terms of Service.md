(“Licensor”), a Delaware corporation, provides you (“Licensee”) with a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license (the “License”) to permit you to use and access Licensor’s subscription services (“Services”), subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service, solely for the purposes enumerated in the Business Use of Licensor Services & Content section of the Order Form. Termination of this Agreement shall terminate the license granted to Licensee hereunder.

2. Source License. The Services may include access to third party data, software, content, information, and/or services (together, “Third Party Content”.) By accessing Services, Licensee is agreeing to be bound by each of these third parties’ terms with respect to their respective Content (a “Source License”). No license is conveyed for any use of the Content, unless a Source License is explicitly purchased as a line item on the Order Form.
    
    a) Licensee will maintain a proper Source License at all times with the appropriate Information Sources, and will abide by the terms of the Source License. At the request of any Information Source, for any reason, Licensor may suspend the delivery of the relevant Content within the Services.
    
    b) Upon request by Licensor, Licensee shall provide to Licensor a copy of all information & reporting as required to maintain compliance with the policies of the Information Sources.
    
    c) Licensee's failure to comply with any Source License shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. The Client further agrees to indemnify and hold Licensor and its affiliates harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, charges, and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and such fees and/or penalties any Information Source may impose, arising out of any breach by Licensor of this Section 2.
    
    d) The provisions of Section 2 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
    
3. Term and Termination. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date as specified in the Order Form, and unless terminated earlier as permitted hereunder, will continue for the length of the Initial Term as specified in the Order Form. At the end of the Initial Term, and at each anniversary of the Recurring Term as specified in the Order Form, this agreement will automatically renew for additional Recurring Terms (each Initial Term and Recurring Terms collectively referred to as "Contract Term"), until at least sixty (60) days written notice of termination is given by either party prior to the end of the then-current Contract Term.
    
    a) Termination by Licensor. Licensor reserves the right to terminate this Agreement or discontinue Services or any portion or feature thereof, for any or no reason, at any time, without liability to Licensee.

Licensor DISCLAIMS, AND LICENSEE EXPRESSLY WAIVES, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATERIALS OR SERVICES FURNISHED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF Licensor HAS BEEN ADVISED, KNOWS, OR SHOULD KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL Licensor’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATERIALS OR SERVICES FURNISHED HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT WAS ACTUALLY PAID TO Licensor BY LICENSEE UNDER THE AGREEMENT DURING THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE SUCH CLAIM AROSE. THE LIMITATIONS STATED IN THIS SECTION APPLY WHETHER THE ASSERTED LIABILITY OR DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BREACH OF WARRANTY), TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE GROUND. EACH OF THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IS INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY OTHER EXCLUSIVE OR NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.
    
17. Indemnity. Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor and its affiliates, distributors, resellers, licensors, Licensees, members, managers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns, harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, liabilities, losses, fines, penalties, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable legal fees) (collectively, “Losses”) arising out of, relating to or resulting from (i) the use of, access to, or reliance on Services, Licensor’s website, or Content by Licensee or any other third party whose access to or reliance on Services, Licensor’s website, or Content is made available, directly or indirectly, by, through or because of Licensee; (ii) any negligent or willful act or omission of Licensee; or (iii) Licensee’s breach of this Agreement.

Such persons will be informed of and will agree to the provisions of this Section, and Licensee will remain responsible for any unauthorized use or disclosure of Licensor Confidential Information by any of them.
    
19. Licensee Systems. Licensee will be responsible for providing any hardware, devices or applications necessary to access Services and any of Licensor’s websites.
    
20. Compliance with Laws. In connection with Licensee’s performance of its obligations hereunder and otherwise in connection with its access to and use of Services and Content, Licensee is responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations; the rights of third parties; and all Licensor policies described herein.

28. Miscellaneous. The Agreement shall be governed in all respects by California law, without regard to conflict of law principles. All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Mateo County, California, USA, and Licensee and Licensor consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. The Agreement, and any documents referenced herein, constitute the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings or communications between the parties, whether written or oral. A waiver of any default by either party is not a waiver of any subsequent or different default by either party. If any provision of the Agreement or the application thereof to a party shall be declared void, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the extent permitted by applicable law. In such event, the parties shall use their best efforts to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision. Licensee shall not assign or otherwise transfer any of Licensee’s rights or delegate Licensee’s obligations hereunder, and any such attempt is null and void. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by the Agreement.
