1. **1\. TERMS; ACCEPTANCE**  
    Welcome to Razer. These General Terms of Use ("**Terms**") are offered to you by Razer Inc. and its affiliates ("**Razer**") and govern your use as a visitor to [www.razer.com](https://www.razer.com/) and/ or other websites (including any social media sites, mobile webpages and application store pages) managed by Razer that reference the Terms (the "**Razer Sites**"). Please read these Terms carefully. By using, accessing and/or visiting the Razer Sites, you accept and agree to these Terms. If you do not accept and agree to the Terms, you should immediately stop using, accessing, and/or visiting the Razer Sites.  
    

Please also carefully read Razer's Privacy Policy, located [here](https://www.razer.com/legal/customer-privacy-policy). By agreeing to these Terms, you also agree to and accept our Privacy Policy.  
  
In addition to the Terms and Privacy Policy, other and/or additional terms may apply in certain limited instances, such as when you register a Product or a service, sign up for a promotion, opt-in to receive email, or download software. Razer will present such terms to you before you register, sign up, opt-in, or download.  
  

1. **2\. MODIFICATIONS**  
    We reserve the right to make changes at any time to the Razer Sites, these Terms, our policies, and/or terms applicable to a service, registration, sign up, opt-in, or download. We will notify you of any material changes to the Terms by posting the new Terms on the Razer Sites. Please consult these Terms regularly for any changes. The date of the last revision appears at the top of the Terms. Your use of the Razer Sites following any changes to the Terms will signify your acceptance of the revised terms.  
      
    
2. **3\. ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE RAZER SITES**  
    Subject to these Terms, Razer grants you a limited license to access and use the Razer Sites for your personal, non-commercial use. However, except as otherwise provided in these Terms, the contents of the Razer Sites is owned by or licensed to Razer, and protected by various intellectual property and other laws. Consequently, without our express written consent, you may not download (other than through page caching) or modify a Razer Site or any portion thereof, or reproduce, distribute, duplicate, copy, display, sell, mirror, or otherwise exploit the Razer Sites or any portion thereof. You are granted a limited, revocable, and non-exclusive right to create a hyperlink to the home page of Razer.com so long as the link does not portray Razer or Razer.com in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter. You may not use any meta-tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing Razer or Razer's name or trademarks to reference the Razer Sites without our express written consent. You may not use disguised referrals to link to any Razer Site. Without our prior written consent, you may not exploit the Razer Sites or any content appearing therein for commercial purposes. If you are under age 13, you may use the Razer Sites only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Any unauthorized use of the Razer Sites or use in violation of these Terms terminates this limited license.  
      
    
3. **4\. REVIEWS AND COMMENTS; PROHIBITED CONDUCT; NO OBLIGATION FOR RAZER TO MONITOR; ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS**  
    Razer gives visitors to the Razer Sites the option of posting Razer product reviews or various other opinions and comments ("Your Comments") on specified sections of the Razer Sites. To do so, you may have to provide personal information (a term defined in the Privacy Policy). You retain ownership of Your Comments, but by posting you grant Razer a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media Razer in its sole discretion selects. You grant Razer and sub-licensees the right in our sole discretion to use the name that you submit in connection with such content, but Razer shall at all times use the name and content in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any content. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to, and/or have a right to post, the content that you submit and/or post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate these Terms and will not cause injury or damage to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify Razer for all claims resulting from content you supply.  
    

The content you post may not be illegal, obscene, offensive, racist, sexist, hateful, threatening, defamatory, libelous, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable to Razer in its sole discretion, and shall not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, advertisements, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam."  
  
Razer takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party. Razer may monitor, review or edit such content you or others post or submit, but is not obligated to do so.  
  
When you visit a Razer Site or send e-mails to us, you are communicating with us electronically and therefore consent to receive communications from us electronically. We may communicate with you by e-mail or by posting notices on the Razer Sites. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

Any feedback you provide is deemed to be non-confidential and non-proprietary. Razer shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis.  
          
        Outside of the above-mentioned feedback avenue, Razer does not accept or consider unsolicited ideas, including (without limitation) ideas for new or improved products or technologies, product enhancements, collaterals, processes, materials, new advertising campaigns, promotions, marketing plans or new product names (each an "**Unsolicited Idea**"). Kindly refrain from sending any Unsolicited Ideas in any form to Razer or its employees. This policy is necessary to avoid potential misunderstandings or legal disputes in event of any similarity of Razer's products, services or activities to an Unsolicited Idea.

4. **8\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES**  
    YOUR USE OF THE RAZER SITES AND ALL CONTENTS THEREON IS AND SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE RAZER SITES AND ALL CONTENTS THEREON ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RAZER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE RAZER SITES, ALL CONTENTS THEREON, AND SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND TITLE. RAZER MAKES NO WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE CONTENTS OF THE RAZER SITES OR OF SITES LINKED TO THE RAZER SITES, AND DOES NOT ENDORSE OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE RAZER SITES OR ANY HYPERLINKED WEBSITES. RAZER ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER MALWARE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE RAZER SITES, FOR ANY ERRORS, MISTAKES OR INACCURACIES IN CONTENT, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE IN ANY WAY THROUGH THE RAZER SITES.

The foregoing limitations will apply even if any warranty or remedy provided under this Agreement fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or other limitations set forth above, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.  
      
    
6. **10.MISCELLANEOUS**  
      
    1. **GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION**

        You also agree that any disputes shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC Rules") for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.  
          
        If you are a consumer based in the European Union, the preceding paragraph on arbitration does not apply, and you may make a claim in a competent court of the country in which you reside.  
          
        
    2. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY; WAIVER; ASSIGNMENT**  
        These Terms and other legal notices published by Razer on the Razer Sites applicable to an activity you engage in shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Razer concerning the Razer Sites. If any of the provisions of these Terms shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver, and Razer's failure to assert any right under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right. You agree that any cause of action arising out of or relating to the Razer Sites must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, and otherwise is permanently barred. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, but Razer may assign these Terms without restriction.  
          
        
    3. **INDEMNIFICATION**  
        You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Razer, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from and against any loss, cost, damages, liability and expense arising out of or relating to your use of the Razer Sites and/or any action by you which violates any law, regulation or rights of a third party.  
          
        
    4. **LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES**  
        The Razer Sites may contain links to third-party websites. You acknowledge and agree that Razer does not control such websites and is not responsible for their contents or policies, and that the links are provided for convenience and do not represent an endorsement by Razer of the third-party websites. If you access such websites via the links, you do so at your own risk.  
          
        
    5. **TERMINATION**  
        Without prior notice, Razer may terminate your license to access the Razer Sites and/or your user account if you violate or breach the Terms or for any other reason, including Razer's discontinuance of the Razer Sites.
