3. **3\. Uses Made of your Personal Information:**  
    In this section, we set out the purposes for which we use Personal Information that we collect via our website and, in compliance with our obligations under local laws and European law, identify the "legal grounds" on which we rely to process the information.  
      
    These "legal grounds" allow companies to process personal data only when the processing is permitted by the specific "legal grounds" set out in local laws or European law, as applicable.

    If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.  
      
    Please note that in addition to the disclosures we have identified below, we may disclose Personal Information for the purposes we explain in this notice to service providers, contractors, agents, advisors (e.g. legal, financial, business or other advisors) and affiliates of Razer that perform activities on our behalf, as well as other members of the Razer group.

    **Use justifications:** legal obligations, legal claims, legitimate interests (to cooperate with law enforcement and regulatory authorities).  
      
    
4. **4\. Profiling and Automated Decision Making**  
    The advertisements and recommendations (including online, while you are logged into your Razer ID account, and while you are using our mobile app) which we show you are chosen by analysing the Personal Information you provide to us as described in section 2, including information about your past purchases from us, the way in which you use our products and/or services, and previous advertisements which you have clicked on. To choose advertisements which are tailored and most likely to be of interest to you, we compile and analyse information received from all our customers to gain a better understanding of your preferences from customers similar to you.  
      
    We use similar predictive techniques to combat payment fraud, as described below.  
      
    
5. **5\. Identity Verification**  
    When you create an account or initiate a transaction on our site, we may process your Personal Information (including your name, mobile number, identification number, passport number, nationality, address, date of birth and related documents including your identification card, passport, proof of residence documents such as utility, phone or bank statements and/or government agency letter) for the purposes of identity verification checks and/or to comply with our know-your-customer obligations under applicable laws. You may submit such Personal Information to us through a third party such as Jumio ([http://www.jumio.com](http://www.jumio.com/)) or SingPass MyInfo ([http://api.singpass.gov.sg/](http://api.singpass.gov.sg/)). If the Personal Information submitted to us is insufficient, inaccurate and/or does not pass our identity verification checks in our view, we may disable your account and/or decline to process your transaction(s). In the event you selected biometric verification as an authentication option, then Razer will collect and process a public key generated by your device for the purpose of (a) identity recognition; (b) login verification; and/or (c) transaction instruction verification. This public key is generated by your device using public key cryptography and sent to Razer when you select biometric verification. Upon receipt by Razer, this public key will be associated with your RazerID account, so that RazerID can recognize and verify your device. In doing so, Razer does not process or access any biometric information stored on your device, including your private key kept in your device. For avoidance of doubt, Razer does not collect, transfer, process, control or possess any biometric information that you may have stored on your device (eg. fingerprints, faceprints, and voiceprints, iris or retina scans, keystroke, gait, or other physical patterns, and sleep, health, exercise, genetic, physiological, behavioral or biological data).  
      
    
6. **6\. Processing of Payments on our Site**  
    When you submit a payment request on our site (including when making purchases from our online store, or when purchasing Razer Gold or Razer Silver), we pass your payment information (including information about your past transactions, the current transaction, your Razer ID, credit card details and IP address) to a third party service provider, namely Forter ([http://www.forter.com](http://www.forter.com/)) which conducts anti-fraud checks on our behalf. Our online store merely queries whether the payment information provided by you satisfies the criteria set by Forter's algorithm and then returns back the results. If your payment information does not satisfy Forter's criteria, the payment request will be declined.  
      
    This process may result in you not being able to complete a purchase on our site. You may want to check your payment information or try again using a different method of payment. Otherwise, you may request that we provide information about our decision-making methodology and ask us to verify that the automated decision has been made correctly. We may reject the request, as permitted by applicable law, including when providing the information would result in a disclosure of a trade secret or would interfere with the prevention or detection of fraud or other crime but generally in these circumstances we will ask Forter to verify that its algorithm and source data are functioning as anticipated without error or bias.  
      
    
7. **7\. Sharing your Personal Information (and transfers outside of the EEA)**  
    We will only use or disclose your Personal Information for the purpose(s) it was collected and as otherwise identified in this Privacy Policy.
    1. **Sharing outside the Razer group**: Personal Information may be provided to third parties, including anti-fraud organisations, legal, regulatory or law enforcement authorities in cases of suspected criminal activity or contravention of law, for the detection and prevention of fraud, or when required to satisfy the legal or regulatory requirements of governments, regulatory authorities or other self-regulatory organizations, or to comply with a court order or for the protection of our assets (for example, collection of overdue accounts).
    2. **Sharing within the Razer group**: We may share your Personal Information within the Razer group, including locations outside of the European Economic Area where we do business, for marketing purposes, for legal and regulatory purposes, to manage credit risk and other business risks, to perform analytics, to ensure we have correct or up to date information about you (such as your current address or date of birth) and to better manage your relationship with us.
    3. **Business sale or reorganization**: Over time, we may buy new businesses or sell some of our businesses. Accordingly, Personal Information associated with any accounts, products or services of the business being purchased or sold will be reviewed as part of the due diligence process and subsequently transferred as a business asset to the new business owner. We may also transfer Personal Information as part of a corporate reorganization or other change in corporate control.
    4. **Sub-contractors and agents**: We may use affiliates or other companies to provide services on our behalf such as data processing, account administration, fraud prevention and detection, analytics and marketing. Such companies will be given only the Personal Information needed to perform those services and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes. We have contracts in place holding these companies to the same standards of confidentiality by which we are governed.  
          
        
8. **8\. EEA Rights to Personal Information / GDPR**  
    EEA individuals have the right, under certain circumstances, to:
    
    * Access their personal information;
    * Correct inaccurate personal information;
    * Request erasure of their personal information without undue delay;
    * Request the restricted processing of their personal information;
    * To receive the personal information that they have provided us with, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit that information to another controller without hindrance or ask us to do so; and
    * To object to the processing of their personal information.
    
      
    Such users may request access to their personal information and modify or remove most information associated with their Razer account at any time by logging into their Razer account and accessing features such as Edit Profile and Account Info. Users may also email to exercise any of the above rights by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.razer.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  
      
    EU users also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the EU Member State of their habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if they consider that our processing of their personal information infringes the applicable data protection laws. Please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.razer.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we will provide you with detailed information regarding the contact details of the respective competent supervisory authority.  
      
    [Learn more about Razer GDPR](https://www.razer.com/gdpr)  
      
    
9. **9\. Transfers Outside of the EEA**  
    Your Personal Information may be accessed by staff, suppliers or other persons in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the EEA. We will, in all circumstances, safeguard personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy.  
      
    Where we transfer Personal Information from inside the European Economic Area (the EEA) to outside the EEA, we may be required to take specific additional measures to safeguard the relevant Personal Information. Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export Personal Information to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals (see the full list here [https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index\_en.htm](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm)), we will establish legal grounds justifying such transfer, such as EU Commission-approved model contractual clauses, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.  
      
    If you live outside the EEA, or California, Razer will undertake best efforts to give you a similar degree of control over your privacy.  
      
    
10. **10\. Security of your Personal Information**  
    (a) We use physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, access, modification, destruction, disclosure, loss or theft of your Personal Information in our custody or control.  
      
    (b) We have agreements and controls in place with third party service providers requiring that any information we provide to them must be safeguarded and used only for the purpose of providing the service we have requested the company to perform.  
      
    
11. **11\. Security over the Internet**  
    (a) No data transmission over the Internet or website can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion. However, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information in accordance with data protection legislative requirements.  
      
    (b) All information you provide to us is stored on our or our subcontractors' secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.  
      
    
12. **12\. Retention of your Personal Information**  
    Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. When Personal Information is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymise the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymised information) or securely destroy the data.  
      
    
13. **13\. Marketing**  
    Most of our processing is permitted by "legal grounds" other than consent (see section 2 above). In relation to Direct Marketing, where we are required to do so, we will obtain your consent before using your Personal Information for this purpose. If you prefer not to receive our Direct Marketing communications and/or not have your Personal Information shared among the members of the Razer group for the purpose of marketing, you can have your name deleted from our Direct Marketing and/or shared information lists.  
      
    Direct Marketing means our communication with you such as mail, telemarketing or email, using your contact information, to inform you about products and services that we think may be of interest and value to you. This does not include communications regarding products or services that you currently have, including improved ways to use the products, or additional features of the products as well as transactional information.  
      
    
14. **14\. Updating information**  
    We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate. In order to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the Personal Information that you have provided to us by contacting us as set out in the "Contacting Us" section below.  
      
    
15. **15\. Your rights**  
    If you have any questions in relation to our use of your Personal Information, you should first contact us as per the "Contacting Us" section below. Under certain conditions, you may have the right to require us to:  
      
    (a) provide you with further details on the use we make of your information;  
      
    (b) provide you with a copy of information that you have provided to us;  
      
    (c) update any inaccuracies in the Personal Information we hold;  
      
    (d) delete any Personal Information the we no longer have a lawful ground to use;  
      
    (e) where processing is based on consent, to withdraw your consent so that we stop that particular processing;  
      
    (f) object to any processing based on the legitimate interests ground unless our reasons for undertaking that processing outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights;  
      
    (g) restrict how we use your information whilst a complaint is being investigated; and  
      
    (h) Your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g. the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g. the maintenance of legal privilege). If you exercise any of these rights we will check your entitlement and respond in most cases within a month.
