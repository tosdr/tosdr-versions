Certain jurisdictions where we offer our Services do not authorize the exclusion of certain warranties. To the extent permitted by the applicable law, we exclude all and any warranties.

Limitation of liability

To the extent permitted by the applicable law, in no event shall Mediaweb Limited, its suppliers and service providers accept liability to any person for any direct or indirect loss of profits, revenue or data, or for indirect, special, consecutive, aggravated or punitive damages or interest, whether in contract or in tort, including negligence, or otherwise, arising out of or related to the use of all or part of these web pages, even if Mediaweb Limited has been advised of the possibility of the same.

To the extent permitted by the applicable law, the total liability of Mediaweb Limited, its suppliers and service providers, for any claim arising from these General Terms and Conditions of Use, including for any implicit warranty, is limited to the amount you paid us to use our Services.

Under no circumstances can Mediaweb Limited, its suppliers and service providers be held liable for any loss or damages which were not reasonably foreseeable.

We recognize that, in some countries, you can enjoy certain rights as a consumer. No clause in these General Terms and Conditions of Use limits the consumer’s legal rights which cannot be waived by any contract.

Resolution of Claims or Disputes

Mediaweb Limited hopes to make you a happy customer and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting our customer service department through the [contact page](https://www.athena-medium.com/contact) that can be accessed from this link. If, however, there is an issue that still needs to be resolved, this Agreement describes how both of us will proceed.

Please read this Agreement carefully. THIS AGREEMENT STARTS WHEN YOU ACCEPT. You accept when you do any of the following things after an opportunity to review this agreement: give us a written or electronic signature; tell us orally or electronically that you accept; keep the product for more than 30 days. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS, YOU MUST INFORM US WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT. If you request it, we will credit your account in full for the product or service.

This Agreement (the “Agreement”) affects your legal rights and remedies and provides that disputes between you and the seller of this product, Mediaweb Limited (the “Company”), must be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in a court.

Any claim or dispute between you and Mediaweb Limited (or any of Company’s subsidiaries or affiliates) arising out of or relating in any way to the product or service or this Agreement shall be resolved through final, binding arbitration. This obligation applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves a tort, fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other legal theory. Included are all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of our relationship; claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement; and claims related to direct marketing efforts, including complaints concerning unsolicited text messages, emails, and telemarketing calls.

We each agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding. All arbitrations under this Agreement shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and setting forth the specific relief sought. All Notices to Mediaweb Limited shall be sent to the following address: Mediaweb Ltd – Suite 2 – 260 Main Street – GX11 1AA Gibraltar.  Upon receipt of such Notice, the other party shall have a thirty-day period in which it may satisfy the claim against it by fully curing the dispute and/or providing all the relief requested in the Notice. After the expiration of such thirty-day cure period, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. The arbitration of any claim or dispute under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its International Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. These rules and procedures are available by calling the AAA or by visiting its web site at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). The number of arbitrators shall be three. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitration of any claim or dispute under this Agreement shall be conducted in Gibraltar or in the location in which you received this Agreement or in your home state or country.

For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed US$25,000, Mediaweb Limited will pay all costs of the arbitration and will agree to conduct the arbitration through the AAA offices in your home state. For any claim under US$10,000, Mediaweb Limited further agrees that any hearings may be held by telephone and that Mediaweb Limited will not seek attorney’s fees in the event the Company prevails. You acknowledge and agree that each party shall pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses.

For U.S. residents only: This Agreement concerns a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.

About these General Terms and Conditions of Use

The General Terms and Conditions of Use come into force on the date on which you accept them and continue for an indefinite period unless you unsubscribe from the Service (Cf ‘[How do I unsubscribe?](#unsubscribe)‘ in this document).

We reserve the right to change these Terms and Conditions of Use at any time without notice, for example to reflect changes in the law or in our Services and/or Products. We recommend that you consult these Terms and Conditions of Use regularly.

Severability clause

To the extent that any provision of these General Terms and Conditions of Use is found by any competent court or authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, that provision shall be deemed not to be part of these General Terms and Conditions of Use but such finding shall not affect the validity, lawfulness or enforceability of the remainder of these General Terms and Conditions of Use, in that jurisdiction, nor shall it affect the validity, lawfulness or enforceability of these General Terms and Conditions of Use in any other jurisdiction.

The preceding sentence does not apply to New Jersey residents or transactions.
