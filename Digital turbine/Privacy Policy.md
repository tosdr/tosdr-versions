* **Opt-out of Selling or Sharing**. You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information related to you or otherwise the use of such data for targeted advertising or profiling for the purpose of making decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you. As detailed above, we do not sell or share personal information. Still, we do engage third parties that collect personal information on our Website to provide us with services that, although they do not pay us for collecting information, the right granted to them may be considered as disclosure for the purpose of sale or sharing. You can opt out of such processing at any time by contacting us or visiting our [**Do not Sell or Share My Personal Information**](https://blu.mobileposse.com/en/do-not-sell.html?utm_source=cashew_redirect).
* **Non-discrimination**. You also have a right not to be discriminated against for exercising your rights under US Privacy Laws.

### **Exercising Your Rights**

If you wish to exercise any of your rights in relation to personal information related to you, please send us an email to [privacy@digitalturbine.com](mailto:privacy@DigitalTurbine.com).

You can stop using the Website at any time.

You may also control what personal information we collect from your device by changing the permissions settings on your browser or mobile device.

You may request to exercise the rights detailed under this section by submitting your request to us by emailing [privacy@digitalturbine.com.](mailto:privacy@DigitalTurbine.com.)

Note that only you or a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a request related to personal information related to you. A request for access can be made by you only twice within a 12-month period.

Also note that your request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it properly.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with the requested personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information related to you. We will only use the personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.

We will do our best to respond to your request within 30 days of receipt. If we require more time (up to 30 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of your request. Our response will also explain why we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If the request warrants a fee, we will inform you of the reasons for such a decision and provide a cost estimate before completing your request.

We will not require that you create an account to exercise your rights under this Policy, and we will not increase the cost or decrease the availability of our Website based solely on the fact that you have chosen to exercise one of your rights.

After receiving our reply, you can appeal against our decision by contacting us. We will review your appeal and provide you with our answer and our explanation of the reasons for our decision(s) within 60 days of receiving it. We will also provide you with a link (to the extent available) where you can submit a complaint with the relevant Attorney General or Supervisory Authority, as applicable.

### **Aggregated and Analytical Information**

We use standard analytics tools. The privacy practices of these tools are subject to their own privacy policies, and they use their own cookies to provide their service (for further information about cookies, please see our [Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies Policy](https://www.digitalturbine.com/legal/cookie-policy/)).

We use the standard analytics tools of Google Analytics, and we will use additional or other analytics tools from time to time to learn how you and other users use our Website to support its related activities and operations.

The privacy practices of these tools are subject to their own privacy policies. See Google Analytics Privacy Policy at [Privacy Policy – Privacy & Terms – Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).

We use anonymous, statistical, or aggregated information and will share it with our partners for legitimate business purposes. It has no effect on your privacy because there is no reasonable way to extract data from the aggregated information that we or others can associate specifically with you.

### **Specific Provisions for United States Residents**

This section applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the US.

Any terms defined under US Privacy Laws have the same meaning when used in this section.

Additionally, as used under this section and the rest of this Policy, personal information is defined under applicable US Privacy Laws.

### **Selling and Sharing Personal Information**

We do not sell or share personal information. However, we engage third parties to provide services such as analytics, marketing automation, and user experience and allow them to collect personal information on our Website.

We do not knowingly sell or share consumers’ personal information of children under 16 years of age.

The categories of personal information collected by these third parties in the preceding 12 months include identifiers, online activities, and inferences drawn from such activities.

These third parties do not pay us for collecting such information. Still, the right granted to them to collect personal information may be considered as disclosure for the purpose of sale or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising. At any time, you can opt out of collecting personal information from our service providers by contacting us or visiting our [**Do not Sell or Share My Personal Information**](https://blu.mobileposse.com/en/do-not-sell.html?utm_source=cashew_redirect) page.

Digital Turbine is committed to ensuring the security of personal information. We and our hosting services implement systems, applications, and procedures to secure personal information related to you to minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information. These measures provide sound industry-standard security.

However, please understand that no security system is impenetrable. Although we make efforts to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that the Website will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.

### **Dispute Resolution**

We do periodical assessments of our data processing and privacy practices to ensure that we comply with this policy, update the policy when we believe that we need to, and verify that we display the policy properly and in an accessible manner. If you have any concerns about how we process personal information related to you, you are welcome to contact our privacy team at [privacy@digitalturbine.com](mailto:privacy@DigitalTurbine.com) or write to us.

We will look into your query and make good-faith efforts to resolve any existing or potential dispute with you.

From time to time, we will update this policy. If the updates have minor, if any, consequences, they will take effect 14 days after we post a notice on the Website. Substantial changes will be effective 30 days after we initially posted the notice.

Until the new policy takes effect, if it materially reduces the protection of your privacy right under the then-existing policy, you can choose not to accept it and stop using our Website. Continuing to use the Website after the new policy takes effect means that you agree to the new policy. Note that if we need to adapt the policy to legal requirements, the new policy will become effective immediately or as required by law.
