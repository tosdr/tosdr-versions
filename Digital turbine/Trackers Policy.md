### **What Are ‘Cookies’?**

Cookies are small files with pieces of information, normally consisting of just letters and numbers, which websites use when users visit them.

Software on the users’ devices (for example, a web browser) can store cookies and send them back to the website the next time they visit, to make a specific function of the website work and to provide information about the user’s activities on the website.

### **For What Purposes Are Cookies Being Used?**

Cookies are used in numerous ways. For example, when analyzing traffic to a website or tracking users’ browsing behavior. Cookies are widely used as they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. Cookies and other similar technologies help websites to remember the visitors and their activities, for example, the user’s login details, or the goods users wish to buy when they add goods to their online basket or proceed to the checkout on an internet shopping website.

### **What Are ‘Session’ and ‘Persistent’ Cookies?**

“Session Cookies” are removed from your device once you close your browser session.

“Persistent Cookies” last for longer periods on your device – after you close your browser session.

A user can delete previously set persistent cookies manually or configure the browser settings to delete cookies, as further described below.

### **What Are ‘First-party’ and ‘Third-party’ Cookies?**

First-party cookies are set directly by the website that the user is visiting. For the purpose of this Policy, these are cookies that are set directly by this Website.

Third-party cookies are set by a domain other than the one visited by the user. For the purpose of this Policy, these are cookies that are set by service providers of this Website.

### **What Are ‘Similar Technologies’?**

Functions usually performed by a cookie can be achieved by other means. This could include, for example, using certain characteristics to identify devices so that visits to a website can be analyzed.

Any technology that stores or accesses information on the user’s device is relevant for this purpose, and therefore it includes, for example, HTML5 local storage, Local Shared Objects and fingerprinting techniques.

Additionally, technologies like scripts, tracking pixels and plugins, wherever these are used – are also considered as similar technologies.

### **Does Digital Turbine Use Tracking Technologies?**

Yes, we do.

We use both Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies as part of your experience on this Website so that we can facilitate the use of the Website’s features and tools, keep track of your preferences, improve your experience with our Website, for web analytics and for marketing purposes.

Some cookies are strictly essential for the operation of this Website while other cookies help to improve our services and marketing activities. The same rule goes for all Tracking Technologies that we use.

We have created a detailed Tracking Technologies table page, which is attached as an **[Appendix A](#AppendixA)** to this Policy and is available [here.](#AppendixA) The table will provide you with a clear and comprehensive image of the Tracking Technologies that we use.

When a Tracking Technology contains personal data, as indicated in **[Appendix A](#AppendixA)**, then the Digital Turbine Privacy Policy applies as well.

**By using our website, you expressly consent to the use of cookies and the use of your personal data to use our website for the purpose of improving our internet services. This consent also includes the use of service providers by Digital Turbine, as designated in Appendix A, and the transfer of data to them for this purpose.**

### **Does Digital Turbine Need to Obtain My Consent for Using Tracking Technologies?**

Yes, however only with respect to the Tracking Technologies that are not strictly essential for the operation of this Website, as further indicated in **[Appendix A](#AppendixA)**. For essential Tracking Technologies Digital Turbine does not need your consent.

If you do not agree to accept our cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are not strictly essential for the operation of this Website, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with as similar level of services as we can.

### **Can I Manage My Tracking Technologies Preferences?**

Every browser allows you to manage your Tracking Technologies preferences, usually found in the “Help” or “Settings” sections of the web browser.

Here are some links to some commonly used web browsers: (a) [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)[;](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) (b) [Microsoft Edge](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy)[;](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy) (c) [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)[;](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences) (d) [Microsoft Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)[;](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies) (e) [Opera](https://www.opera.com/help/tutorials/security/privacy/)[;](https://www.opera.com/help/tutorials/security/privacy/) (f) [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/safari)[.](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/safari)

This Website does not respond to DNT signals.

### **Will We Change This Policy?**

We update this Policy, when needed. Every time we change this Policy, we will post a notice on this Website if our policy update includes substantial changes and obtain your consent once again, where required under applicable laws.

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

In the event that IP anonymization is activated on this website, however, your IP address will be truncated beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

On behalf of the website operator, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator.
