Cookies are used to enable the use of our website and to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, if you do not want this, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your end device or a message always appears before a new cookie is created. You can object to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes for a variety of services, e.g. at [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) or via the deactivation page of the network advertising initiative [http://optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/). If you deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all the functions of our website.

For each individual cookie, the name of the cookie, the purpose that the cookie is intended to fulfil, any third-party access to the cookie and the duration of its function and the period after which a cookie is deleted are specified. Session cookies are deleted after the end of your use of our website or after the end of the browser session.

If third parties, for example service providers who process data on our behalf, can access a cookie, please refer to the relevant section of this privacy policy.

**a) Required cookies**

**WEB ANALYSIS BY GOOGLE ANALYTICS (ANALYSIS COOKIES)**

**GOOGLE ANALYTICS SECTION**

We use Google Analytics from Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) on this website to statistically analyse visitor data. Google Analytics uses targeted cookies for this purpose. Further information on terms of use and data protection in this context can be found at [http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html) or at [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de).

**Pseudonymisation**

Our concern in terms of the GDPR is the improvement of our offer and our website. As the privacy of our users is important to us, the user data is pseudonymised. Data processing is carried out on the basis of the legal provisions of § 96 para. 3 TKG and Art. 6 EU GDPR para. 1 lit a (consent) and/or f (legitimate interest) of the GDPR.

**Deactivation of data collection by Google Analytics**

Using the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js), website visitors can prevent Google Analytics from using their data. You can prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de)

**Google Analytics IP anonymisation**

We have implemented IP address anonymisation from Google Analytics on this website. This function was developed by Google so that this website can comply with the applicable data protection regulations and recommendations of the local data protection authorities if they prohibit the storage of the full IP address. The anonymisation or masking of the IP takes place as soon as the IP addresses arrive in the Google Analytics data collection network and before any storage or processing of the data takes place.

You can find more information on IP anonymisation at [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=de](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=de).

**Google Analytics reports on demographic characteristics and interests**

We have activated the functions for advertising reports in Google Analytics. The reports on demographic characteristics and interests contain information on age, gender and interests. This allows us to get a better picture of our users without being able to assign this data to individual persons. You can find out more about the advertising functions at [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=de\_AT&utm\_id=ad](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=de_AT&utm_id=ad).

You can stop the use of the activities and information of your Google account under "Settings for advertising" at [https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated) by ticking the checkbox.

**Google Analytics deactivation link**

If you click on the following [deactivation link](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=de), you can prevent Google from recording further visits to this website. Please note: Deleting cookies, using the incognito/private mode of your browser or using a different browser will result in data being collected again.

**Microsoft Clarity**

We use the "Microsoft Clarity" program from Microsoft Corporation (One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052, USA) on this website. If you have your habitual residence in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, the provider is Microsoft Ireland Operations, Ltd (One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, D18 P521, Ireland). (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Microsoft")

In particular, we process usage data (e.g. Internet presentations visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses), location data (information on the geographical position of a device or person), movement data (mouse movements, scrolling movements). Corresponding cookies are used for this purpose.

"Microsoft Clarity" enables us to analyze the use of our website. This creates a log of mouse movements and clicks with the intention of deriving potential improvements for the website. According to information from Microsoft, this information can also be used for advertising purposes and other services related to the use of our website and the use of the Internet. We use Microsoft Clarity with the so-called anonymization function. This function allows Microsoft to shorten the IP address within the EU or EEA.

The purpose of the processing is tracking (e.g. interest/behavioral profiling, use of cookies), remarketing, conversion measurement (measurement of the effectiveness of marketing measures), interest-based and behavioral marketing, profiling (creation of user profiles), reach measurement (e.g. access statistics, recognition of returning users), cross-device tracking (cross-device processing of user data for marketing purposes).

All users of our website who have consented to the corresponding use via our cookie consent service are affected by this data processing. Data processing is therefore carried out solely on the basis of your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. This consent is voluntary and there are no adverse consequences for you if you do not give it. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. The lawfulness of the processing carried out up to that point remains unchanged.

The legal basis for the third country transfer to the Microsoft Corporation in the USA is the adequacy decision of the European Commission in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR in connection with the active participation in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework by the Microsoft Corporation. Further details can be found at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list)

You can find Microsoft's data protection information in the Microsoft Privacy Statement at [https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement)

Further information and Microsoft Clarity's privacy policy can be found at [https://clarity.microsoft.com/terms](https://clarity.microsoft.com/terms)

**8\. Use of session storage as part of internal search functions**

For the purpose of providing the search function, so-called "session storage technology" (also known as "session storage") is used on our websites. The search terms you enter are stored locally in your browser and read out from there.

With regard to the functionality of the search function, this is technically absolutely necessary in order to be able to display the search results list again after a search result has been called up when the "Back to search" button is pressed. The search terms are automatically removed from your browser immediately after closing the browser ("session"), unless you delete them manually beforehand.

When you enter search terms in the search field, netcup GmbH expressly does not request any personal data from you and we would like to point out that, for data protection reasons, you should avoid entering personal data in the search field.

III. Server log files

When you access our website or the individual pages, the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website. The following information is stored in log files:

* IP address of the requesting computer
* Date and time of access
* Name and URL of the retrieved file
* Website from which the access is made (referrer URL)
* The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer
* Status codes and transferred data volume

This data is processed for the following purposes:

* Provision of the website including all functions and content
* Ensuring a smooth connection to the websites
* To ensure a comfortable use of websites
* Ensuring system security and stability
* Anonymised statistical evaluation of access
* Optimisation of the website
* Disclosure to law enforcement authorities if an unlawful intrusion/attack on our systems has taken place
* Other administrative purposes

This data will be deleted after fourteen days if it is no longer required for other purposes (e.g. defence or assertion of claims).

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes described above.

IV. Contract data

In connection with and for the purpose of fulfilling pre-contractual measures and contractual obligations for our offer, which are carried out at your request, we process the data necessary for the fulfilment of the contract. This includes

* Name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number, different billing e-mail address if applicable, company if applicable
* Customer number
* Contract data, e.g., subject matter of the contract (services booked), term, customer category
* Payment data, e.g., bank details, credit card details, payment history

Optionally, the following data can also be processed:

* Further contact details, for example a fax number
* For more secure access, a second factor for logging into our user interface

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Your data will be used for the purposes of our offer and to contact you for information relevant to the offer and registration. We create a customer account for you for this purpose. Due to the nature of our services, you need the customer account so that you can view, monitor and configure the services you have ordered from us. You can view and change your data via your personal user account. Your data will be stored until you cancel your contracts with us and delete the customer account or instruct us to delete your data. If we have to store your personal data due to legal obligations, in particular under tax and commercial law, the processing of your personal data will be restricted accordingly until the retention periods expire. This data will then be deleted.

If you conclude a contract with us by placing an order or use the user account in any other way, for example to configure your contractual services, we store the IP address and the time of the respective usage action. The storage takes place on the basis of our and your legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR for the provision of our offer and pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR for protection against misuse and other unauthorised use. The user account and the data stored in this context are also used in particular to make it easier for you to place further orders with us and to access your order history. This data will not be passed on to third parties unless it is necessary for the fulfilment of contractual obligations pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR or to safeguard our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, for example to pursue any claims to which we are entitled or to defend ourselves against claims directed against us, or unless there is a legal obligation to do so pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.

The data will only be passed on to third parties for the fulfilment of contractual obligations in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR insofar as this is necessary for the fulfilment of pre-contractual measures and contractual obligations, e.g. to banks, payment service providers, credit card companies for the processing of payments, to shipping service providers for the dispatch of goods and, when registering domains via us, to registrars of top-level domains.

V. netcup customer forum

When you create a user account for the netcup customer forum, you must agree to the terms of use for the netcup customer forum. In doing so, you conclude a licence agreement with us. You can view the terms of use for the netcup customer forum at [https://forum.netcup.de/system/disclaimer/](https://forum.netcup.de/system/disclaimer/)

In connection with and for the purpose of fulfilling pre-contractual measures and contractual obligations for your membership of the netcup customer forum, which are carried out at your request, we process the data required for the fulfilment of the user contract concluded with you. This includes your name, your e-mail address and a user name selected by you to create your user account.  
Once you have created your user account, you can voluntarily save additional data in your user account (e.g. an avatar, photos or your address) and exchange messages with other users. Depending on your activities for the netcup customer forum, further details can be added to your user account (for example, likes received from other users and awards for special achievements).  
If you use your user account for activities in the netcup customer forum, for example to create posts, we store this data in order to make the netcup customer forum available to users and the public. You can find more information on this in the terms of use for the netcup customer forum at [https://forum.netcup.de/system/disclaimer/](https://forum.netcup.de/system/disclaimer/)

The legal basis for the processing of this data is Article 6 (1)(b) GDPR. The personal data collected is processed by us in order to provide the netcup customer forum and to contact you for information relevant to offers and registration. You can view yourpersonal data and make changes to this data via a personal user account.

Your data will not be passed on to third parties beyond the use and publication in the netcup customer forum, unless it is necessary for the fulfilment of contractual obligations pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR or for the pursuit of any claims to which we are entitled or defence against claims asserted against us or there is a legal obligation to do so pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Your data will be stored until you delete your user account or instruct us to delete your data. If we are obliged to store your personal data due to statutory retention periods, in particular under tax and commercial law, the processing of your personal data will be restricted accordingly until the retention periods expire and then this data will be deleted.

If you contribute content to the netcup customer forum, you grant us the right to use this content. We will therefore continue to store and process the relevant content in order to make the netcup customer forum available to users and the public after youruser account has been deleted. However, we will anonymise your user name if you have deleted your user account for the netcup customer forum. You can find more information on this in the terms of use for the netcup customer forum at [https://forum.netcup.de/system/disclaimer/](https://forum.netcup.de/system/disclaimer/)

If you create a user account for the netcup customer forum on our website or use the user account for the netcup customer forum, we store the IP address and the time of the respective usage action. The storage takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR for the provision of our offer. Storage is also in your interest in order to protect you from misuse and other unauthorised use. The IP addresses are anonymised or deleted after 7 days at the latest.

The data will only be passed on to third parties to the extent that this is necessary to fulfil pre-contractual measures and contractual obligations, to provide the netcup customer forum, if we are legally obliged to pass on the data (e.g. by official order) and to assert, exercise or defend against claims.

Captcha questions are used to ensure that the customer forum is not overrun with spam bots. Captcha questions are an internal service of our forum software and are currently requested during registration and for the "Forgot password" and "Send e-mail to user" functions. The search function is currently used without a Captcha query, as this can only be accessed when a user is already logged in.

VI. Friendlycaptcha

This website uses Friendlycaptcha. Friendlycaptcha is used to ensure that the forms provided are used by a natural person and not misused by machine or automated processes.

Friendlycaptcha records your IP address and sends a cryptogaphic task to the device you use to access our website. This cryptogaphic task is solved by your end device without any input from you. If the task is solved correctly, Friendlycaptcha confirms to the server on which our website is operated that a human and not a machine is visiting our website.

When a form that uses Friendlycaptcha is called up on our website, the following data is processed and stored by Friendlycaptcha:

* IP address of the requesting computer in anonymised form
* The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your end device
* The website from which Friendlycaptcha is accessed
* The cryptographic task that contains information about our use
* The Friendlycapthca software version we use
* Date and time of access
* Website from which access is made (referrer URL)

Friendlycaptcha stores an anonymised counter for each IP address in order to control the complexity of the cryptographic tasks and to prevent authorised users from being blocked. This data is recorded separately from the other data and cannot be assigned to specific websites. For this purpose, the IP addresses are anonymised with a hash value so that users can no longer be identified.

Friendlycaptcha is offered by Friendly Captcha GmbH, Am Anger 3-5, 82237 Woerthsee, which operates on our behalf. Personal data is processed by this service provider on our behalf. We use this service in our legitimate interest in the security of our website and the detection of bot activity in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

VII. Communication and advertising

If you use other means of communication to send us an enquiry, we also need your name and contact details where we can reach you (e.g. e-mail address, address, telephone number or fax number). If you do not provide this data, we will not be able to process your enquiry or contact you. In addition, you can voluntarily provide your telephone number and other data.

When you contact us, we process your personal data to process your request on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, provided that your request is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measureswith you personally. In all other cases, the processing is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR and/or in our legitimate interest in the effective processing of enquiries addressed to us in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

3\. Postal advertising

If you are a customer of ours and we have received your data in connection with the sale of a product or the use of a service, we may use your data (first and last name, address and, if you work for a company, your company affiliation) for direct mail advertising for goods or services offered by us or by third parties. In addition to this data, we may also store other data that we have lawfully collected about you for the aforementioned advertising purposes. This may include, for example, your order history or the type of goods you have purchased from us.

The purpose of this data processing is to target you as precisely as possible with advertising that matches your interests and to avoid advertising that does not appeal to you. The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest in direct marketing in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Your data will be processed and stored for this purpose until you object to further use for postal advertising.

Postal advertising requires a certain lead time before dispatch in order to print the items and make them ready for dispatch. If you object to postal advertising, you may exceptionally still receive advertising from us by post. This may happen if the production process for the relevant mailing had already started when you objected. This does not mean that we will not take your objection into account.

4\. Newsletter

If you would like to receive our newsletter, we need your e-mail address. You can provide your name voluntarily. Data processing for the purpose of sending the newsletter is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR on the basis of the consent you have voluntarily given by means of the so-called double opt-in procedure. The email address will be used for this purpose and stored until you withdraw your consent or unsubscribe from the newsletter. You cannot subscribe to our newsletter without this consent. You can unsubscribe at any time, for example via a link at the end of each newsletter. Alternatively, you can also send your cancellation/unsubscribe request at any time to the email address stated under Section II.

We send our newsletters with a so-called tracking pixel. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in the HTML format of the newsletter sent to enable an analysis of reader behaviour. In this context, we store whether and at what time a newsletter was opened by you and which of the links contained in the newsletter were called up by you. We use this data to create statistical evaluations of the success or failure of a marketing campaign in order to optimise the newsletter mailing and better tailor the content of future newsletters to your interests. The data collected will not be passed on to third parties and will be deleted after the statistical analysis.

5\. Direct e-mail advertising to customers

If you are a customer of ours, we may use your e-mail address for direct advertising for our own similar goods or services. This only applies if you have not objected and we clearly inform you of the possibility of objection when collecting the e-mail address and each time it is used. You can object to the use of your e-mail address without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. For direct advertising by e-mail, we process your e-mail address, your name, if you have used our offers as an employee of a company, your company affiliation, the data we have collected about your use of our offers and the type of goods or services you have purchased from us in order to be able to customise our offers to you. The legal basis for processing is Section 7 (3) UWG and our legitimate interest in direct marketing in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

Your data will be processed and stored for this purpose until you object to further use for direct e-mail advertising or unsubscribe from receiving direct e-mail advertising. You can unsubscribe at any time, for example via a link at the end of each e-mail. Alternatively, you can also send your objection or unsubscribe request at any time to [mail@netcup.de](mailto:mail@netcup.de).

6\. Community events

If you would like to participate in one of our community events, we need your first and last name and your e-mail address. It is also possible to optionally provide any additional information (such as allergies or intolerances) to help us plan activities (such as buffets). You can also voluntarily enter your forum name.

Optionally, when registering for community events, you can express your interest in future community events or register for corresponding e-mail notifications regarding any details in advance.

Data processing for the purpose of planning, coordinating and implementing community events is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR on the basis of your voluntarily given consent by means of the so-called double opt-in procedure.

Your personal data may be passed on to the following recipients in order to achieve the above-mentioned purpose:

* ANX Holding GmbH, Feldkirchner Straße 140, 9020 Klagenfurt, Austria
* ANEXIA Deutschland GmbH, Daimlerstraße 25, 76185 Karlsruhe, Germany

No third country transfers take place and none are planned.

No automated decision-making within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR is used in connection with community events.

Your personal data will be processed or stored for the above-mentioned purpose until you withdraw your consent or until it is no longer necessary for the original purpose.

Without this consent, you will not be able to participate in our community events. Your consent is always voluntary. You can withdraw your consent or unsubscribe at any time.

The easiest way to withdraw your consent or unsubscribe is to send your request to the e-mail address specified in Section II. The lawfulness of the processing carried out up to that point is not affected by the withdrawal.
