A Farewell and a Hello
======================

To our Artifact Users and Partners,

We’ve already shared our [decision](https://medium.com/@artifact_team/1e70de46d419) to wind down operations of the Artifact app. You may have noticed that we kept our core news reading capability running a bit longer than planned - until April 2nd. While Artifact will no longer operate as a standalone app or site, the proprietary AI-powered personalization technology and other features will live on and be integrated across Yahoo, including in [Yahoo News](https://news.yahoo.com/), in the months to come. We think the technology Artifact has created will be even more impactful with the scale of the Yahoo News network, ranked the #1 news and information property in the US in 2023.

Thank you to all who have joined us on this adventure we call Artifact. Can’t wait to see how the technology we’ve built lives on through Yahoo.

— The Artifact team
