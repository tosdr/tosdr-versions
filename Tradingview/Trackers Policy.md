==============

This Cookies Policy (**"Cookies Policy"**) describes cookies and other technologies that TradingView, Inc. (**"TradingView"**, **"we"**, **"us"** or **"our"**) uses on its website (**"Site"**) and the choices that users have. This Cookies Policy is a part of TradingView’s Privacy Policy.

When you first visit the Site, you will be asked to consent to the use of cookies in accordance with this Cookies Policy. Note that if you accept, we will store them on your computer.

What is a cookie?
-----------------

A 'cookie' is a piece of information that is sent to your browser by a website you visit. The Site uses first party cookies (those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time. For example, cookies via www.tradingview.com) as well as third-party cookies (set by a different domain), as described below.

Cookies can be stored on your computer for various periods of time. They can be in a form of either "session cookies" or "persistent cookies." A session cookie only lasts as long as the browser session and is automatically deleted when you close your browser. A persistent cookie lasts long after your browser is closed and will remain until it expires (as determined by the third party in charge of placing it) or until you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies are used to help sites recognize and identify your computer when you open your browser and surf the Internet again.
