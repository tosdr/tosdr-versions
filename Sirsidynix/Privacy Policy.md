For purposes of transferring Personal Data between the United States and the EU, the UK and other covered countries, we participate in, and comply with, the EU-U.S. and UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Frameworks”).

The services of the dispute resolution provider will be available at no charge to you. Binding arbitration is available to address complaints not resolved by other means. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In the context of an onward transfer, we are responsible for the processing of Personal Information we receive under the Frameworks and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf.
