If at any time, any amounts owing by an Organization to Anedot are not paid when due for any reason, including, any Processing Fees or charge-backs, penalties, or fines (collectively, the “**Unpaid Amounts**”), then Anedot may pursue any and all legal remedies to recover such Unpaid Amounts.

These obligations will survive the termination of the Organization or the Organization’s use of Anedot’s Services.  

(e) We may modify the Processing Fees at any time upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice (or a longer period of notice if this is required by applicable law). Such modified Processing Fees shall automatically be effective after such notice period.  

4.2 Accepted Forms of Payment.  

The Fundraising Services support most domestic credit, debit, prepaid or gift cards with a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover logo, and in some cases in Anedot’s sole discretion, direct debit (electronic checks) and PayPal. In addition, the Fundraising Services supports most international cards with these logos. We may add or remove support for certain payment cards at any time without prior notice.

(b) If any Organization enters into a billing or other agreement with another Organization (a “**Billing Agreement**”) that provides for the automatic deduction of any fees from the Donations and other purchases as the fee for the provisions of services by such other Organization (as modified, the “**Services Fees**”) and payment of such Services Fees to such Organization, then each such Organization authorizes Anedot to deduct the Services Fees from the applicable Donations and to pay the Services Fees to such other Organization. Upon Anedot’s request, each of the Organizations shall promptly provide to Anedot a fully executed copy of any Billing Agreement and any amendments to such Billing Agreement (but in no event later than five (5) business days after execution).

THE PROCESSING FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE, NON-CANCELLABLE AND NON-CREDITABLE UNLESS (A) THE DONATION HAS BEEN VOIDED BY THE FUNDING ORGANIZATION OR OTHERWISE PRIOR TO PROCESSING OR (B) OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW OR AGREED TO BY ANEDOT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION.

21.3 Dispute Resolution.  

If a dispute arises between you and Anedot, the goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective method of resolving the dispute quickly.

Before resorting to these dispute methods, Anedot strongly encourages you to first contact Anedot directly to seek a resolution.  

**(a) Choice of Law.** These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, PROCEEDING, CAUSE OF ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ANY OF THE ANEDOT SERVICES.

YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST ANEDOT INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if Anedot is a party to the proceeding.  

This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.  

(ii) Judicial Forum for Disputes. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate under Section 21.3(b) is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Anedot agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, the federal or state courts covering Dover County, Delaware. Both you and Anedot irrevocably consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.  

**(d) Improperly Filed Claims.** All claims you bring against Anedot must be resolved in accordance with this Section 21.3. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section 21.3 shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section 21.3, Anedot may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $15,000, provided that Anedot has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.  

**(e) Prevailing Party.** In the event that either party institutes any legal suit, action or proceeding against the other party arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any of the other Anedot Services, the prevailing party in the suit, action or proceeding shall be entitled to receive in addition to all other damages to which it may be entitled, the costs incurred by such party in conducting the suit, action or proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and court costs.

21.4 Severability.  

If any provision of these Terms (including any Additional Agreements and Policies) is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  

21.5 Relationship of the Parties.  

The parties agree that nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, franchise, agency, employer/employee, or similar relationship between the parties, or as authorizing either party to act as the agent of the other. You are and will remain an independent contractor in your relationship to Anedot. Nothing in these Terms shall create any obligation between either party and a third party.  

21.6 Assignment.  

These Terms and related Additional Agreements and Policies, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Anedot without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void.  

21.7 Survival.  

Upon termination of these Terms, your use of the Site, any of the other Anedot Services or your relationship with Anedot any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 2, 4 and 9 – 21.

The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.
