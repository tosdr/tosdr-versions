We do not Engage in Automated Decision-making without Human Intervention

We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.

Consequences of not providing Personal Information

If you do not provide certain personal information identified in this policy, (a) you may not be able to donate or otherwise use the Fundraising Services or (b) we may not be able to provide the support that we otherwise could if you do provide this personal information.

Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.

The technologies we use for automatic data collection may include:

• **Cookies (or browser cookies).** A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to the Site.  

Do Not Track Policy

Your web browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. We do not honor any web browser “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms that provide you with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. At present, no universally accepted standards exist on how companies should respond to do-not-track signals. In the event a final universally accepted standard is established, we will assess and provide an appropriate response to these signals.

Third-party Responsibilities and Services.

We may use or partner with other third-party companies, agents or contractors for various purposes in connection with our business and operations (“**Service Providers**”), including, the processing of donations and other payments, the marketing and growth of our business, and the performance of services on our behalf, such as gathering and analyzing information and the provision of services to you. In the course of performing these responsibilities and providing such services, these other companies may have access to your information. We may also share information, including your information, with these Services Providers in order to enable them to perform these responsibilities and to provide these services. These Services Providers may have adopted their own privacy policies, which are not subject to control by Anedot. You should always review the policies of these Service Providers to make sure that you are comfortable with the ways in which they collect, use, maintain, protect and disclose your information. We do not list our current Service Providers because they change from time to time. If you would like the names of any of Service Providers, please email us at [help@anedot.com](mailto:help@anedot.com).

The Service Providers may also transmit cookies to your computer or device when you click on ads that appear on or through the Service.

As a convenience to you, we may or may in the future also provide links to other third-parties from within our Service. If you click on one of these links, you will be redirected to that third-party’s site (via affiliate cookies) and such third party may also transmit cookies to you. We do not have any control over that or how they collect, use, maintain, protect and disclose your information. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you are no longer using any of the Anedot Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your web browser.

Facebook Pixel

The Facebook pixel is an analytics tool that allows us to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements by understanding the actions visitors take on the Site. We use pixel data to:

• Make sure our advertisements are being shown to the right people  
  
• Build advertising audience  
  
• Unlock additional Facebook advertising tools  
  
• When someone visits the Site, and acts (like making a donation) the Facebook pixel is triggered and reports this action. This way we will be able to reach out to that person again through future Facebook advertising.  

More information about Facebook’s privacy practices can be found at [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy).

LinkedIn Insight Tags

We use the “LinkedIn Insight Tag” on the Site. It helps us with in-depth campaign reporting and insights about our website visitors. It can also be used to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and unlock additional insights about members interacting with our ads on LinkedIn.

The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data regarding members’ visits to our website, including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics (User Agent), and timestamp. This data is encrypted, the IP addresses are truncated, and members’ direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous. This remaining, pseudonymized data is then deleted within 90 days.

LinkedIn does not share personal data with us, it only provides aggregated reports about the website audience and ad performance. LinkedIn also provides retargeting for website visitors, enabling us to show personalized ads off our website by using this data, but without identifying the member. LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their account settings.

More information about LinkedIn’s privacy practices can be found at [terms](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/sas-terms#additional-terms-for-optional-conversion-tracking), [privacy policy](http://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy%20) and [cookie policies.](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy)
