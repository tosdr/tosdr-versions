### Cookies

We use cookies on Our Website (‘SAM Learning’) to improve its performance and enhance your user experience. This policy explains how we do that.

#### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that  a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie helps the website to recognise your device the next time you visit and to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. We use the term ‘cookies’ in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.

There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember your username and preferences, or analyse how well SAM Learning is performing.

Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to ‘remember me’ when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies will not collect information that identifies you, but will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use SAM Learning.

#### What sort of cookies does SAM Learning use?

Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:

* ##### Essential cookies
    
    Some cookies are essential for the operation of SAM Learning. If you opt to disable these cookies, you will not be able to access or use all of the features that SAM Learning incorporates.
    
* ##### Performance cookies
    
    We use other cookies to analyse how our visitors use SAM Learning and to monitor performance. This allows us to provide a high-quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages.
    
* ##### Functionality cookies
    
    We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you use SAM Learning and recall your preferences.
    
* ##### Targeting or advertising cookies
    
* These cookies contain a unique key that is able to distinguish individual users’ browsing habits or store a code that can be translated into a set of browsing habits or preferences using information stored elsewhere. Cookies may also be used to limit the number of times a user sees a particular ad on a website and to measure the effectiveness of a particular campaign..

#### Does anyone else use cookies on SAM Learning?

We do use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the four categories above. For example:

* SAM Learning uses Google Analytics software to monitor website behaviour to enhance our service offering. This software will save a cookie to your device in order to track and monitor your engagement and usage of the website, but will not store, save or collect any personal information. You can read [Google’s privacy policy here](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for further information.
* We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue tracking, improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our terms and conditions and copyright policy.

We allow Facebook Pixel to use cookies, web beacons and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from our websites and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. You can read Facebook’s [Data Policy here](https://en-gb.facebook.com/policy.php). You can also control your Facebook privacy settings [here](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen).

#### Can you block cookies?

As we have explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of SAM Learning.

However, if you do wish to disable cookies then you can do so by amending the settings within your browser or mobile device.

Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of SAM Learning will not work properly.
