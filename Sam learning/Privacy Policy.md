#### SAM Learning Data & Privacy Policy

This privacy statement covers your use of the website and related services provided by SAM Learning Ltd (‘SAM Learning’). Specifically, this policy sets out what data is collected, how that data is used, how it is kept secure and how long it is kept. It also outlines your rights to access your data and how to contact SAM Learning for more information.

#### What data does SAM Learning require schools to share?

We require all schools to share learner first and last name, admission number, gender, date of birth, registration group, school year, unique pupil number (UPN), school email address and classes. This data is needed in order to properly provision learner accounts as well as SAM Learning services.

In addition to the above data, a school may choose to share data on the following learner characteristics: ethnicity, free school meals status, FSM6 status, pupil premium status, special education needs status, looked after children status, and English as an additional language status. This data is needed to allow filtering and analysis based on these learner characteristics. Specifically, this includes advanced functionality as listed:

* School Intervention groups to be created, as requested by the school’s senior leader
* Advanced learner data filters for progress-monitoring enabled
* Teacher/senior leader detailed customised reports enabled, including an intervention-focus report

Teachers and senior leaders who wish to use SAM Learning are required to share their first and last name, job title, school role, email address, educational/subject interests and exam boards used. They are also linked to their timetabled classes data. This data is needed in order to properly provision teacher/admin accounts as well as SAM Learning services.

We also store the address and contact details of the school.

#### How is this data gathered by SAM Learning?

Learner data is shared one of three ways over which the school has full control:

* A School Data Manager installing and authorising WONDE or Groupcall XoD that, once set up, automatically syncs nightly to our secure servers by SSL 3.3/TLS 1.2 encryption (see [Groupcall – GDPR Statement](https://www.groupcall.com/our-gdpr-compliance) – [WONDE – School Data & Information Security Overview](https://www.wonde.com/security/))
* A Senior Leader manually uploading a data file to our secure servers by SSL 3.3/TLS 1.2 encryption (see [SAM Learning – Data Sharing Agreement](https://www.samlearning.com/privacy-policy-gdpr/))

Teacher and senior leader data is either collected via WONDE, Groupcall XoD or inputted manually by the user as part of their registration process.

#### What is the lawful basis for storing this data?

This data is required for learners, teachers and senior leaders to be able to use the SAM Learning platform for Three-wave intervention support, revision, classroom use and homework, in accordance with the school’s contractual agreement with SAM Learning.

#### Where and how is this data stored?

The data is stored on SAM Learning’s servers in data centres in Ireland, provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS data centres are compliant with the international information security standard, ISO 27001.

We do not share learner data with ZenDesk unless a learner emails us directly, in which case we store their first and last name, school name and email address. ZenDesk is based in the USA and this data transfer is covered by the EU-US Privacy Shield.

Lastly, we do share anonymised learner data with third-party organisations, like [Fischer Family Trust](https://fft.org.uk/the-fischer-family-trust/) (FFT) for educational statistical analysis only.

#### How long will the data be kept?

During the subscription period, if a learner becomes a leaver, their account and all associated data is anonymised within 90 days.

All personal data is anonymised or deleted (your choice) within 90 days after the school subscription ends – if we receive no instructions, we anonymise all data within 90 days.

Upon request, we can destroy a school’s data within 24 hours.

#### How will the data be anonymised?

Learner, teacher and admin (senior leader) data will be anonymised as follows:

##### Learner Accounts

Learner first names are replaced with ‘Anonymous’ and last names are replaced with ‘Learner-’ along with a random string of 6 numbers/letters. For example, Albert Einstein would become ‘Anonymous Learner-BFHPIL’. This is carried out so that we can continue to improve our understanding of program efficacy and impact evaluation, while ensuring anonymity. Below is a full listing of learner data fields and treatments applied:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### What is your policy for serious incidents such as data breaches?

Should a school or subject (user) report a serious incident, such as a data breach, or should a serious incident be identified by SAM Learning, we will notify the impacted school’s senior leader and any affected subjects within 48 hours.

Following SAM Learning’s internal data breach protocol, we will work closely with all subjects impacted to minimise the incident and ensure it is fully resolved.

To report a concern or possible incident involving SAM Learning, [submit a support ticket](https://samlearning.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), email [DPO@samlearning.com](mailto:DPO@samlearning.com) or call SAM Learning Customer Support on 0845 130 4160 Monday-Friday from 8:00am to 5:00pm.

SAM Learning uses cookies to optimise your experience on our website and provide you with a more tailored, improved experience. SAM Learning uses Google Analytics software to monitor website behaviour to enhance our service offering.  This software will save a cookie to your device in order to track and monitor your engagement and usage of the website, but will not store, save or collect any personal information. You can read [Google’s privacy policy here](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for further information.

If you don’t want cookies to be stored on your device, you should make the necessary changes to your device, relevant browsers or apps.

#### How can access be revoked for members of staff who have left a school?

For schools registering their staff manually, senior leaders with an active SAM Learning admin account can make a member of staff inactive, which will prevent them from having access to SAM Learning.

1. Sign into the SAM Learning admin account
2. Click ‘Profile’
3. Click ‘Teacher Data’
4. Find the member of staff from the list
5. Change the corresponding drop down from ‘Active’ to ‘Inactive’
6. Click Save

For schools using WONDE or Groupcall XoD to supply teacher data, a list of active teachers will be synced daily from the school’s Management Information System, e.g. SIMS and any teachers no longer present will automatically have their SAM Learning accounts deactivated. They will receive an email notification of this.

On request we can delete a teacher or admin account, removing the teacher/senior leader and their data from our servers completely, within 24 hours.

How can learner data be removed when the learner leaves the school?

If your school elected to manually upload learner data: at any time senior leaders with an active SAM Learning admin account can delete learner accounts using the Learners page of SAM Learning. This prevents those learners from accessing SAM Learning and immediately deletes all of that learner’s data from our servers completely.

1. Sign into the SAM Learning admin account
2. Click ‘Learners’
3. Find the learner from the list
4. Tick the corresponding checkbox next to the learner’s last name
5. Click ‘Delete Learner’ found at the bottom of the page
6. Confirm your selection
7. Click Yes

If your school elected to provision learner data via SIMS-sync or Groupcall XoD integration: during the subscription period, if a learner becomes a leaver, their account and all associated data is automatically anonymised within 90 days.

On request we can delete the learner, removing the learner and their data from our servers completely, within 24 hours.

#### How can I access my data?

A Subject Access request can be made by [submitting a support ticket](https://samlearning.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) or by emailing [DPO@samlearning.com](mailto:DPO@samlearning.com). Upon authenticating the subject’s identity, we will provide all data we hold on the subject (or organisation) in a spreadsheet, within 30 days.
