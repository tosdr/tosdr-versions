### Social Media Code of Conduct

Code of Conduct Toastmasters International’s core values are integrity, respect, service and excellence. These are values worthy of a great organization, and Toastmasters believe Toastmasters should incorporate them as anchor points in every decision Toastmasters make. Our core values provide Toastmasters with a means of not only guiding but also evaluating our operations, our planning, and our vision for the future.

The following are Rules of Conduct that apply to any form of communication on this Site and all Toastmasters online social media platforms:

1\. Maintain Professional Decorum & Integrity

> A. The Toastmasters International Code of Ethics and Conduct applies to social media participation, including standards for communications.
> 
> B. As a Toastmaster, it is important that all members conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times in accordance with the core values. This includes the use of social media. Accordingly, it is important that Toastmasters members, Toastmasters leaders and World Headquarters staff, and site visitors be treated with respect at all times. Never engage in personal attacks – threatening, insulting, or intimidating other users, as well as “flaming” (berating another user), “trolling” (posting derogatory, inflammatory, or provocative content attempting to bait others into responding). This includes any attacks against forum moderators, fellow Toastmasters or World Headquarters employees.
> 
> C. Disagreements can and will occur. The proper focus of any conflict should be on the issue at hand and not on the individual. Please remember to be fair and courteous when disagreeing with others. Debate and differing opinions may be appropriate. Personal attacks against others, however, are not allowed.
> 
> D. Never act dishonestly or unprofessionally by engaging in behavior that is detrimental to the best interests of Toastmasters International by posting inappropriate, inaccurate or objectionable content.
> 
> E. Do not, under any circumstance, harass, abuse, bully, or harm another person, including sending unwelcome communications to others.
> 
> F. Never upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available or initiate any content that:
> 
> > 1\. Is unlawful, racist, sexist, homophobic, hateful, damaging, false, libelous, defamatory, malicious, vulgar, obscene, or discriminatory, contains religious or ethnic bias, or is otherwise objectionable. For example, never post anything meant to harm someone's personal or professional reputation or jokes based on race, sex, religion or disability.
> > 
> > 2\. Includes information that invades another’s privacy or that you do not have the right to disclose or make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships.
> > 
> > 3\. Infringes upon patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights or other proprietary rights. When quoting copyrighted work be sure to credit the original source and, if appropriate, add a link.
> > 
> > 4\. Includes any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, “junk mail,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” surveys, or any other form of solicitation. This includes any content soliciting customers, clients, donors, or others on behalf of your business, profession, or any organization or cause other than Toastmasters International.
> > 
> > 5\. Includes any private communication between members, moderators, volunteer leaders, World Headquarters employees or partners of Toastmasters International on these forums or anywhere else without express written permission from the individual you are quoting.
> > 
> > 6\. Impersonates any person or entity, or falsely represents your affiliation with any person or entity.
> > 
> > 7\. Supports or opposes any political party, candidate for public office, ballot measure to be voted upon by the public or legislative proposal.
> > 
> > 8\. Harvests, collects, or discloses information about another user without his or her express written consent.
> > 
> > 9\. Transmits any harmful, invasive, or disruptive code or other materials (such as viruses, worms, or web bugs).
> 
> G. Social media and various official Toastmasters forums tend to involve many participants. They are generally not the best place for members to express frustrations with Toastmasters in leadership above, below or at their level. Communications that contain criticism, complaints, accusations, allegations, etc., are more properly directed through personal conversations, phone calls, or emails through official channels established to address such problems, rather than broadcast via social media and forums. This is the better way to resolve differences while minimizing damage to the goodwill and social fabric of Toastmasters International.
> 
> H. Toastmasters International is not responsible for the content of others. You are solely responsible for your content. You may not indicate that your content is anything other than your own observations or opinions. You may not represent that your statements are made on behalf of or are endorsed by Toastmasters International unless you are specifically authorized to do so in writing.
> 
> I. ANY behavior that is patently offensive is forbidden, whether specifically identified on this list or not.
> 
> J. Social media enables opportunities for immediate and easy transmission of information. Users shall always obtain prior written permission before posting the comments or work of another. Posting information about other individuals requires prior written consent; examples include but are not limited to: re-posting letters, re-using recommendations solicited using another social medium, videos and photographs.

2\. All individuals must adhere and comply with [Policy 3.0: Ethics and Conduct](https://www.toastmasters.org/leadership-central/governing-documents#Policy30EthicsandConduct456).

3\. Comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, including, without limitation, privacy laws, intellectual property laws, export control laws, tax laws, and regulatory requirements. Toastmasters International has the right, but not the obligation, to modify or remove any content that appears on any official Toastmasters forum, and to restrict, suspend or terminate the access of any user, that violates this Conditions of Use, and to take appropriate disciplinary action under the Bylaws, Policies and Protocols of Toastmasters International.

If there will be a significant delay in restocking the product, Toastmasters may ship other portions of your order as scheduled and then ship the late product when it becomes available. Prices, availability, appearance of all products and postage charges are subject to change without notice. Any duties and taxes incurred are the responsibility of the person placing the order.[](#)
