### Do I Have Choices About Sharing My Information?

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

* **Cookies.** While we may automatically use some cookies that are strictly necessary to provide the services you request or enable communications, we request your consent for all of our other cookie uses. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
* **Advertising.** You can opt out of receiving marketing and advertising communications by changing your settings through your **“My Profile”** page or by contacting us through our **“Contact Us”** page. Even if you opt out of receiving marketing messages, we will still send you transactional messages such as order confirmations and receipts and communications necessary to further our legitimate business interests.

* the right to transfer your personal information;
* the right to withdraw your consent for certain types of processing; and

If we do not honor a privacy request for legal or other reasons, we will communicate with you to explain (i) why we did not honor your request, (ii) your right to appeal, and (iii) your right to file a complaint (if available where you live).

### How Secure is My Information?

Toastmasters is committed to protecting the security of your personal information and maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that meet industry standards to guard your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our website, using firewalls and other security technology to protect our network and systems from external attacks, and requiring you to enter a unique username and password to access your account information online.

When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption. Toastmasters International uses industry-standard (SSL) technology to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing potentially sensitive information, such as your name and address, as well as critically sensitive information like your credit card number that you provide or access during a secure session (look for a padlock or key and chain icon on your browser).

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Certain parts of our website require a password, and you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Passwords registered with our website are encrypted to ensure protection against unauthorized access to your personal information. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of our website. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of our website. It is important for you to guard against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

How long we retain specific personal information varies depending on the purpose for its use, and we will delete your personal information in accordance with applicable law.

### Will my Personal Information be Transferred to other Jurisdictions?

Toastmasters and [toastmasters.org](https://toastmasters.org/) are located and operated in the United States.

If you do not agree to this international transfer of data, you should not use [toastmasters.org](https://toastmasters.org/) and the Services or otherwise send us your personal information. By providing your personal information to us through [toastmasters.org](https://toastmasters.org/) or the Services, you consent to the cross-border transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information.
