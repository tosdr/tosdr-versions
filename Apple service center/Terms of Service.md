Terms and Conditions for NETSYSTEMS Gadget Services

Introduction  
NETSYSTEMS is a premium gadget service owned and operated by Netsystems. Any repair services provided by NETSYSTEMS are subject to these terms and conditions.   
Service Timing  
If your gadget is collected for repair, it typically takes 2-3 business days for it to be fixed. However, this timeline may be extended due to parts procurement and approval delays.   
Contact Information  
For quick and efficient communication, kindly mail your request ID to netsystems@applelaptopservice.center. You can also track the status of your gadget repair by visiting https://applelaptopservice.center/ and entering your request ID.   
Part Replacement  
In the event that your gadget requires a part replacement, the cost of the part will be an additional charge. Our service team will reach out to you exclusively to seek your approval before proceeding.   
Local Service and Taxes

Please note that local service and GST taxes are not included in the repair cost.   
By using the NETSYSTEMS premium gadget service, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, you are not authorized to use the service.

* Repair Process
* If you bring in a gadget that is not functioning, our team will conduct a thorough check-up to determine the issue and provide a list of faulty parts. We may reach out to you multiple times for revised approval of additional parts as we follow a decision tree approach to repair the problem.
* Warranty
* The repair workmanship warranty stands for one month, provided the gadget is not treated, opened, or managed by any other vendor after our last repair. The warranty for replaced parts is separate and depends on the manufacturer’s warranty for each part.
* Physically Damaged Gadgets
* In the event that the gadget is physically damaged or has identified hardware damages, any part that was previously working may stop functioning during the repair process. NETSYSTEMS will not be held liable for returning the gadget in its pre-received partial working condition if the customer denies further repair.
* Basic Visiting Charge
* NETSYSTEMS charges a basic visiting charge of Rs. 350 if the customer declines our service or denies us the opportunity to pick up the equipment.
* Service Charge and Refund
* If we charge the complete service charge (e.g. Rs. 1200), and the customer declines additional repair charges, no refund of any kind will be entertained. If the customer approves additional repair charges and we are unable to source the part or repair it, we will return the gadget with a minimum of Rs. 350 deducted as basic quality charges.
* Data Backup
* NETSYSTEMS does not guarantee data loss or 100% data recovery. Data backup is a separate paid service offered by NETSYSTEMS and will be billed additionally. However, for small amounts of data (less than 4GB), we provide this service for free. Please note that during the repair process, we do not encourage the backup of music or video files.
* Software Validity and Originality
* The customer fully indemnifies NETSYSTEMS for any software/licenses validity/originality on the customer’s device. NETSYSTEMS does not participate in or promote piracy of any kind and advises customers to retain original licenses for all pre-installed application software. NETSYSTEMS is not responsible for any loss of installed application software during the Service process.
* Hardware Replacement
* Hardware replacement rights are solely held by NETSYSTEMS to install new or refurbished parts. The part manufacturer provides a parts warranty. Hardware replacement is not included in the service plan.
* Service Period
* The service period is defined by the start and end date mentioned on the invoice. All hardware repairs will be carried out at our local Technical Repair Centre.
* Loss or Theft
* In the event of loss or theft, NETSYSTEMS will not be responsible for any data-related issues. However, NETSYSTEMS will provide a similar device or its cost (MRP at that time), the final decision of which will be made by NETSYSTEMS.
* Invoice
* Please ensure the request ID or invoice ID is mentioned on the invoice at all times when collecting it.
* Additional Terms and Conditions
