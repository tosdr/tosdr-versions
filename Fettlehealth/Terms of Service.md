If you think that there is a mistake in these terms, please contact us to discuss.

4.2 You can access these terms at any time at fettle.health/terms-of-service. We reserve the right to update these terms from time to time by posting the updated version on our website. We may do so because we change the nature of our products or Services, for technical or legal reasons, or because the needs of our business have changed. You agree that if you do not accept any amendment to our terms then you will immediately stop accessing and/or using the Service and our contract with you will terminate. If you carry on using our Service you will be deemed to have accepted the updated terms.

**5\. Term and Termination**

5.1 Subject to this section and clause 6.4 these terms will remain in full force and effect while you use our Services.

5.2 You can always end the contract between you and us as set out in these terms by notifying us in writing. If having made a request for our Services you end the contract then cancellation charges may apply. Please see our cancellation terms in clause 6.4.

5.3 We may suspend or terminate your rights to use the Service at any time and at our sole discretion, including for any of the following reasons:

* 5.3.1 our performance of providing the Services is affected by an event outside our control;

* 5.3.3 you have not provided us with valid consent (where required);
    
* 5.3.4 you do not co-operate with us in respect of the Services to be provided to you or if you do not comply with these terms or do not agree to any change in our terms.
    

5.4 If we decide to terminate the contract in accordance with clause 5.3 then we will be entitled to retain fees to cover our administrative costs for Services provided up to the date of termination.

5.5 Where reasonably possible, we will explain to you the action we are taking, when that action takes effect and the reasons for it. When doing so we will also inform you of your right to challenge the action taken through our complaints process.

5.6 Upon termination of your rights under these terms, your right to request the Services will terminate immediately. You understand that any termination may involve deletion of your user content associated with you from our live databases for the purposes of complying with data protection law, provided that we may retain medical records in accordance with law and guidance.

**6\. Orders, Cancellations and Refunds**

**6.1 Orders**: You may request our Services via our websiteÂ **(Order)**. To make an Order you will need to:

6.3 Once you have made a request to use our Services and payment has been received we will send you an email confirming your Order.

6.4 If you make an Order by the method as set out in clause 6.2 this will create a legally binding contract between us and the terms as out here will apply to the way we provide these Services to you and what you are required to do under these terms.

**6.5 Cancellations:** The law normally allows a contract made by website or telephone to be cancelled by you within 14 days. The exception to this is where you make an express request to us to provide the Service to you in that period. By making an Order you acknowledge that you are making such an express request because we will perform our obligations in providing Services as soon as your request is confirmed and therefore that the terms of this clause 6 apply. Once you make an Order then the refund terms at clause 6.6 will apply.

**6.6 Refunds:**Â Subject to clause 6.5 you may be entitled to a refund where you;

* 6.6.1 cancel your Order within 2 hours of us confirming your request to use our Services; or

6.8 Once our STI Testing kits, Contraceptive Products and/or Clinical Treatments are opened, you will not be entitled to a refund and you are otherwise subject to our terms relating to refunds and cancellations.

6.9 Where you have made an Order and we have confirmed that you are entitled to a refund in accordance with this clause;

* 6.9.1 then we will return the amount you are due not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel this contract; and

### Interactive services

We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation:

* Chat rooms.

Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).

We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks.

Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.
