The north680.com website (also referred to as the “Site”) is provided by Draper and Kramer, Incorporated (“Draper and Kramer”), a Delaware corporation. “Sites” are defined as any websites under Draper and Kramer’s control, whether partial or otherwise (including, without limitation, the Site and any website from which these terms of use were accessed from). This agreement contains the terms, covenants, conditions, and provisions (the “Terms and Conditions”) upon which you (also referred to herein as “User”) may access and use the Sites.

### Terms and Conditions

BY ACCESSING, VIEWING OR USING THE SITES, YOU INDICATE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND INTEND THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO BE THE LEGAL EQUIVALENT OF A SIGNED, WRITTEN CONTRACT AND EQUALLY BINDING, AND THAT YOU ACCEPT SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THEM.

By using this Site, you consent to Draper and Kramer’s collection and use of personal data as outlined therein.

### Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions

Any sweepstakes, contests or other promotions (“Promotions”) that may be offered via the Site will be governed by a separate set of rules that, in addition to describing such Promotions, may have eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions, terms and conditions governing the Promotions, use of submissions you make, and disclosures about how your personal information may be used.

Your use of this Site to enter into such transactions with us is entirely voluntary. However, if you enter into any such transaction via this Site, you consent to doing such transaction in electronic form, and to providing an electronic signature in the form specified on this Site, rather than a handwritten signature, whenever a signature is required in connection with a transaction on this Site. In addition, you understand and acknowledge that all transactions that you enter into via this Site will be legally binding on you just as if they were done on paper, and that your electronic signature in the form specified on this Site will be binding as though you had physically signed such document on paper by hand.

When you register with the Site, you will be asked to create an account and provide Draper and Kramer with true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself (your “Information”) and, where required, to maintain and update it promptly. Information you submit will be used in accordance with Draper and Kramer’s [Privacy Policy](https://draperandkramer.com/privacy-policy/).

Anyone with knowledge of your User ID and password can gain access to the restricted portions of this Site and the information available to you. Accordingly, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your User ID and password, and for restricting access to your computer, or other device you use to connect to the Site, so that others may not access the Site using your User ID and password. By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you agree to be solely responsible for the confidentiality and use of your respective User ID and password, as well as for any communications entered through the Sites using your User ID and password. You agree to immediately notify Draper and Kramer if you become aware of any loss or theft of your User ID and password or any unauthorized use of your User ID and password, and further agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your User ID and password until such time as you notify us that your User ID and password have been compromised or otherwise request that we cancel your account.

### Links to Other Sites

Draper and Kramer may provide links, in its sole discretion, to other sites on the World Wide Web (“Third Party Websites”) for your convenience in locating related information and services.

### User Content and Submissions

You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, advertisements, messages or other materials submitted, posted or displayed by a User on or through any Site (“User Content”) is the sole responsibility of the person from which such User Content originated. Draper and Kramer claims no ownership or control over any User Content. You or a third party licensor, as appropriate, retain all patent, trademark and copyright to any User Content you submit, post or display on or through Draper and Kramer and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate. By submitting, posting or displaying User Content on or through Draper and Kramer, you grant Draper and Kramer a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such User Content through Draper and Kramer. In addition, by submitting, posting or displaying User Content which is intended to be available to the general public, you grant Draper and Kramer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such User Content for the purpose of promoting Draper and Kramer services. Draper and Kramer reserves the right to refuse to accept, post, display or transmit any User Content in its sole discretion. You also represent and warrant that you have the right to grant or that the holder of any rights, including moral rights in such content, has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant, the license stated above. If you post User Content in any public area of any Site, you also permit any User to access, display, view, store and reproduce such User Content for personal use. Subject to the foregoing, the owner of such User Content placed on any Site retains any and all rights that may exist in such User Content. Draper and Kramer acts as a passive conduit for the online distribution and publication of User Content and has no obligation to screen User Content, communications or information in advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring User Content posted by Users. However, Draper and Kramer may review and remove any User Content that, in its sole judgment, violates these Terms and Conditions, violates applicable laws, rules or regulations, is abusive, disruptive, offensive or illegal, or violates the rights of, or harms or threatens the safety of, users. Draper and Kramer reserves the right to expel Users and prevent their further access to the Sites and/or use of the Services for violating the Terms and Conditions or applicable laws, rules or regulations. Draper and Kramer may take any action with respect to User Content that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if it believes that such User Content could create liability for Draper and Kramer, damage Draper and Kramer’s brand or public image, or cause Draper and Kramer to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its ISPs or other suppliers. Draper and Kramer does not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of User Content or any other communications posted by users or endorse any opinions expressed by users. You acknowledge that any reliance on material posted by other users will be at your own risk. The following is a partial list of User Content that is prohibited on the Sites. The list below is for illustration only and is not a complete list of all prohibited User Content.

Prohibited User Content includes content that:

is implicitly or explicitly offensive, such as User Content that engages in, endorses or promotes racism, bigotry, discrimination, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual;

harasses, incites harassment or advocates harassment of any group or individual;

involves the transmission of “junk mail”, “chain letters,” or unsolicited mass mailing or “spamming”;

promotes or endorses false or misleading information or illegal activities or conduct that is abusive, threatening, obscene, defamatory or libelous;

promotes or endorses an illegal or unauthorized copy of another person’s copyrighted work, such as providing or making available pirated computer programs or links to them, providing or making available information to circumvent manufacture-installed copy-protect devices, or providing or making available pirated music or other media or links to pirated music or other media files;

contains restricted or password only access pages, or hidden pages or images;

Any profile you submit must describe you, an individual person. Examples of inappropriate and prohibited Profiles include, but are not limited to, Profiles that purport to represent an animal, place, inanimate object, fictional character, or real individual that is not you. You may not include in your profile any telephone numbers, street addresses, email addresses or other means of contacting you, other than your last name and URLs. In order to protect our Draper and Kramer users from commercial advertising or solicitation, Draper and Kramer reserves the right to restrict the number of e-mails which a User may send to other users to a number which Draper and Kramer deems appropriate in its sole discretion. If notified by a user of User Content or other materials which allegedly do not conform to these Terms and Conditions, Draper and Kramer may in its sole discretion investigate the allegation and determine whether to take any other actions whether to remove or request the removal of the User Content. Draper and Kramer has no liability or responsibility to users for performance or nonperformance of such activities.

### Policy Regarding Termination of Users Who Infringe the Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Rights of Others

Draper and Kramer, and all of its affiliated companies respect the intellectual property of others, and Draper and Kramer asks Users and content partners to do the same. The unauthorized posting, reproduction, copying, distribution, modification, public display or public performance of copyrighted works constitutes infringement of the copyright owner’s rights. As a condition to your use of the Sites, you agree not to use any Site to infringe the intellectual property rights of others in any way. Draper and Kramer may terminate the accounts of any User, and block access to the Sites of any User who infringes the copyrights, or other intellectual property rights, of others. Draper and Kramer reserves the right to take these actions at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice, and without any liability to the User who is terminated or to the User whose access is blocked.

### Draper and Kramer’s Liability

Draper and Kramer does not screen or censor the Profiles or User Content on the Sites. Draper and Kramer is not involved in the actual communications between Draper and Kramer users. As a result, Draper and Kramer has no control over the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the Profiles or User Content submitted on the Sites and makes no representations about any Profile or User Content on the Sites. In addition, note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, foreign nationals, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom you come in contact through the Sites. By its very nature, other people’s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled. Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, Draper and Kramer cannot and does not confirm that each user is who they claim to be. Because we do not and cannot be involved in user-to-user dealings or control the behavior of participants on any Site, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you release Draper and Kramer (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”

### Events Beyond Draper and Kramer’s Control

You expressly absolve and release Draper and Kramer from any claim of harm resulting from a cause beyond Draper and Kramer’s control, including, but not limited to, the failure of electronic or mechanical equipment or communication lines, telephone or other interconnect problems, computer viruses, unauthorized access, theft, operator errors, severe weather, earthquakes, or natural disasters, strikes or other labor problems, wars, or governmental restrictions.

### DISCLAIMERS

WHILE DRAPER AND KRAMER ENDEAVORS TO PROVIDE THE MOST ACCURATE, UP-TO-DATE MATERIALS AVAILABLE, THE INFORMATION, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE MAY INCLUDE INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION, PRODUCTS OR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT. MOREOVER, DRAPER AND KRAMER MAY MAKE MODIFICATIONS AND/OR CHANGES IN THIS SITE OR IN THE INFORMATION, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES DESCRIBED IN THIS SITE AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY REASON. DRAPER AND KRAMER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SITE AND ITS SERVERS ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL MECHANISMS. IF YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR THE CONTENT RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, Draper and Kramer IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS.

ALL SUCH INFORMATION, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY A USER FROM DRAPER AND KRAMER THROUGH OR FROM ANY OF THE SITES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORM, CONTENT AND ACCURACY OF ANY MATERIAL CONTAINED THEREIN PLACED BY YOU ON THE SITES.

IN NO EVENT SHALL DRAPER AND KRAMER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THIS SITE OR WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THIS SITE, OR FOR ANY INFORMATION, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES OBTAINED THROUGH THIS SITE, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE UTILIZATION OF THIS SITE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF DRAPER AND KRAMER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, TOTAL LIABILITY FOR DRAPER AND KRAMER FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER RELATED TO USE OF THIS SITE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF $100 US DOLLARS.

### Submissions

Draper and Kramer also welcomes your feedback and suggestions about how to improve this Site. Any ideas, suggestions, information, know-how, material, or any other content (collectively, “Submissions”) received through this Site, however, will be deemed to include a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive right and license for Draper and Kramer to, in whole or in part, adopt, publish, reproduce, disseminate, transmit, distribute, copy, use, create derivative works, display, or act on such Submissions without additional approval or consideration, in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in such Submissions. You hereby waive any claim to the contrary.

### Indemnity

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Draper and Kramer and its affiliates and all of their past and present employees, agents, directors, officers, proprietors, partners, representatives, shareholders, servants, attorneys, predecessors, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all claims, proceedings, damages, injuries, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses), relating to or arising from your use of the Site or any breach by you of this Agreement.

### Governing Law

This Agreement has been made in and will be construed and enforced in accordance with Illinois law, as applied to agreements entered into and completely performed in Illinois. Any action to enforce this Agreement will be brought in the federal or state courts presiding in Illinois, U.S., and all parties to this Agreement expressly agree to be subject to the jurisdiction of such courts. This Site is controlled and operated by Draper and Kramer from its offices within the United States. Draper and Kramer makes no representation that materials in the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where any of the contents of this Site are illegal is prohibited. If you choose to access this Site from other locations, you do so on your own volition and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. Draper and Kramer makes no claims that the Content may be lawfully viewed or accessed outside of the United States. Access to the Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access any Site from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.

### Term and Termination

This Agreement will take effect at the time you begin using this Site (thereby indicating acceptance of these Terms and Conditions).
