COOKIE POLICY
=============

### Summary

This cookie policy explains what cookies are and how we use them on our services through our websites, as well as our products and applications (including Zoosk’s mobile applications, downloadable products and applications and pages operated by Zoosk on social networking sites and other platforms) (collectively, the “Services”). It also explains how we use other technologies for purposes that are similar to our use of cookies. We encourage you to read the full policy so that you can understand what information is collected by us through cookies and how that information is used.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer or smartphone) when you visit a website. Cookies can be recognized by the website that downloaded them or other websites that use the same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them before.

### What are web beacons?

Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes also called clear gifs or pixel tags). Web beacons are usually a small image located on a webpage or email that you are viewing. The request your Internet-connected device makes to fetch the image from the server/computer it is stored on is recorded and provides us with information such as the IP address of the computer wanting to view the image, the time the image was viewed, and the type of browser viewing the image. This information is available to any website you visit. For example, we are able to use it to help us deliver cookies, count visits, prevent fraud and to tell if an email or advertisement has been opened and acted upon. In short, cookies work together with web beacons to accomplish the functions and purposes described herein.

### What are cookies used for?

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how our website is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience. Cookies can also help ensure advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

### What types of cookies does Zoosk use?

The types of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into one of the following categories: strictly necessary, analytics, functionality, advertising, social media and fraud prevention. In order to provide you with the best browsing experience, Zoosk and our third party partners may use cookies from all of these categories. You can find out more about the cookies we use from each of the categories in the table below.
