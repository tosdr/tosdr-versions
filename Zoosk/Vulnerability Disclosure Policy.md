ELECTRONIC RECORDS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
=======================================

This disclosure statement provides you with information regarding how Zoosk may provide you with notices, disclosures, information, and other materials in electronic form (collectively “Electronic Records”), rather than in paper form in accordance with The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. Your consent to receive Electronic Records applies to all notices, disclosures, documents, records or other materials of any kind that Zoosk may be required to provide to you. Electronic Records will be provided on our websites, our applications, through our services or sent to the email address associated with your Zoosk account (you may change the email address associated with your Zoosk account by going to the “settings” page). You may wish to print out the Electronic Records and keep them for your records. If you have any trouble printing out, downloading, and/or accessing any Electronic Records, you may contact us by writing to us at Zoosk Customer Care – Spark Networks Services, Attn: Electronic Records, 3731 W South Jordan Parkway, Suite 102-405, South Jordan, UT  84009. In order for you to access and retain Electronic Records sent by Zoosk, you must have the following hardware and software: a computer or other access device capable of reading html and text files, a modem or other means of accessing the Internet, a browser capable of accessing and displaying the Zoosk website and the ability to receive and read email. To print the Electronic Records, you will also need a printer. You may withdraw your consent to received Electronic Records by writing to us at the above address. However, the services provided by Zoosk are only available if you agree to receive Electronic Records, and you understand that withdrawing such consent will result in your account being deactivated.
