SIMILARSITES EXTENSION PRIVACY POLICY
-------------------------------------

\[Last modified: February 21, 2023\]

This privacy policy (“**Privacy Policy**“) governs the data collection practices of Similarweb Ltd. (“**Company**“, “**we**“, “**us**”) that we use in connection with your use of our SimilarSites browser extension offered on our website, [https://www.similarsites.com](https://www.similarsites.com/), and through various browser extension stores (“**Extension**“) and our related services including our Similarweb market intelligence solutions and services (“**Service(s)**“).

This Privacy Policy is an integrated part of the Company’s Terms of Use (available at: [https://www.similarsites.com/termsofuse](https://www.similarsites.com/termsofuse)) (“**Terms of Use**“) and, to the extent that the processing of personal data is based on consent (see below), is a legally binding agreement between you and the Company. The Privacy Policy and Terms of Use shall be binding upon any use or attempt to use the Extension, including any portion thereof. Definitions herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Use.

SimilarSites is a service that allows users to find websites that are similar to the sites they are currently viewing.

The Company respects its users’ privacy and makes every effort to provide a Service that meets industry standards. This Privacy Policy provides important and transparent disclosures on **how** and **why** we collect, **share** and **use** our users’ data, and we encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully prior to using our Extension or Service, and to use it to make informed decisions.

We reserve the right to periodically amend or revise the Privacy Policy at our sole discretion. Such changes and updates will be effective immediately upon the display of the revised Privacy Policy. Thus, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy regularly for updates, so that you are fully informed of how your data is collected and used by the Company and your related rights. The last revision date will be reflected in the “Last updated” heading. Your continued use of the Extension and Service following the display of such amendments constitutes your acknowledgement of such amendments to the Privacy Policy and, where the processing of personal data is based on consent (see below), your agreement to be bound by the terms of such amended policy. In the event of material changes that will adversely affect your use of the Extension or Service or the data collection by us, we will use our best efforts to provide you with notification through our website or the various browser extension stores.

  

IF YOU OBJECT TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR ADD THE EXTENSION TO YOUR BROWSER, OR USE THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.

THE USE OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE GOOGLE API THROUGH THE EXTENSION WILL ADHERE TO THE CHROME WEB STORE USER DATA POLICY INCLUDING THE LIMITED USE REQUIREMENTS THEREIN.

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

The first type of information we collect is non-identifiable aggregated information which is made available via your use of the Extension and Service (“**Non-Personal Information**“). We are not aware of and cannot determine the identity of the users from whom the Non-Personal Information is collected. Non-Personal Information which is collected includes the user’s aggregated and technical information transmitted by the user’s device as well as the following web-browsing data (“**Extension Usage Data**”):

* Standard web server log information (i.e., web request) as well as data sent in response to that request, such as uniform resource locator used, HTTP referrer, and user agent; and
    
* Search engine results page data (keyword, order/index of results, links of results, title, description, and ads displayed).
    

The second type of information we may collect when you install the Extension or otherwise use the Service is identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort be used to identify an individual (“**Personal Information**“), which includes the following:

* Personal Information voluntarily provided by you if and when you contact us, which may include your name and email address, provided that such information will be used solely to communicate with and support you, and will not be shared with any third parties (“**Communication Data**”);
    
* IP address, which is trimmed and hashed (irreversibly encrypted) on a daily basis, and thus is not and cannot be traced back to an individual or used in any way to identify an individual; and
    
* SimilarWeb unique identification number, which is a random number we generate to keep track of the data sets we collect and if required, enable us to execute your data rights requests as further detailed below. Although the unique ID does not reveal the identity of a user and is not generated based on any user personal information, it may be considered Personal Information in some jurisdictions.
    

  

We make sure that the Extension Usage Data is cleaned and scrubbed on your device prior to being sent to our servers, for the purpose of removing and filtering any information that could be used to identify you and transferring solely Non-Personal Information to our servers. You can opt-out of the collection of the Extension Usage Data by following the instructions in the “Opt Out Right” section below.

  

**HOW IS THE DATA USED?**

We collect your information during your access or use of the Extension for the purpose of providing and improving the Services. We use your Extension Usage Data based on the necessity of such information in providing and improving the Services. We process the Communication Data based on the necessity of such information in providing you with the support you have requested. In this context, we use your information in an effort to improve our users’ experience, to communicate with you about our Services, and to further develop, customize, enhance and improve the performance of our Services and Extension.

**HOW IS THE DATA SHARED?**

We do **not** share any Personal Information collected from you with third parties or any of our partners. However, we may disclose information collected from you if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) to enforce our policies and agreements, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) to investigate, detect, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or other wrongdoing, suspected fraud or security issues; (iv) to establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; (v) to prevent harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users, you or any third party; or (vi) for the purpose of collaborating with law enforcement agencies or in case we find it necessary in order to enforce intellectual property or other legal rights.

If we combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.

We may share information collected from or provided by you with our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively “**Affiliated Companies**“) in the event of a corporate transaction (e.g. sale of a substantial part of our business, merger, consolidation or asset sale). In the event of the above, our Affiliated Companies or acquiring company will assume the rights and obligations as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may also appoint third-party service providers (operating under our instructions), who may need access to your Information in connection with their services on our behalf for the purpose of providing and improving the Services.

**USER RIGHTS**

Please note that, unless you instruct us otherwise, we retain the information we collect for as long as needed to provide the services described herein and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

Where provided under applicable law (such as within the European Union), you may have the right to ask us to delete Personal Information which you have provided to us, subject to applicable exceptions, such as in order to preserve that information for anticipated litigation or demands from a regulator, or some or all of the following rights: the right to obtain information on our use of your Personal Information, the right to obtain a copy thereof, the right of data rectification, the right to data portability, the right to object to processing based on our legitimate interests, the right to restriction of the processing, and the right to withdraw your consent.

To assert any of these rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at: [dpo@similarweb.com](mailto:dpo@similarweb.com). Note that we may request proof of identity, and we reserve the right to charge a fee where allowed by law, such as in circumstances where your request is excessive.

In addition, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, subject to applicable law (as is the case in the European Union).

**OPT OUT RIGHT**

You may opt out of the data collection of the Extension Usage Data as follows:

* by right-clicking the extension icon and clicking ‘Opt out from sharing data’.
    
* Note that once you opt out, some or all of the Services provided by the Extension may no longer be available.
    

After you opt out, we will no longer collect and share your data as described in this Privacy Policy.

**DATA RETENTION POLICY**

Unless you instruct us otherwise, we retain the information we collect for as long as needed to provide the Services and to comply with our legal obligations. We believe in data minimization and only keep the information we truly need and only for the period of time required.

**HOW DO WE SAFEGUARD YOUR INFORMATION?**

We endeavor to use security methods and encryption when handling data (i.e., we handle the user data securely, including by transmitting it via modern cryptography). Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the Service cannot be 100% guaranteed.

Transfers of your Personal Information will be made in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

We will take the steps required to ensure that international transfers of personal data (including Personal Information) meet all requirements under applicable data protection law. When personal data collected within the European Economic Area (“**EEA**“) is transferred outside the EEA, we will take the steps required to ensure that the transfer of such data provides adequate safeguards, and you may exercise your rights, where applicable, to receive information on such transfer mechanism. Personal Information transferred outside the EEA is transferred for processing by AWS on its servers in the United States. AWS is a well-respected global cloud provider, who help manage our data in a secure environment, for more information regarding the data security provided by AWS, please se:[https://aws.amazon.com/security/](https://aws.amazon.com/security/). The transfer of Personal Data to our US servers is done pursuant to standard contractual clauses (“**SCC**”) approved by the European Union Regulatory. For more information on SCC and our security measures, please contact our Data Protection Officer at: [dpo@similarweb.com](mailto:dpo@similarweb.com).

**MINORS**  
Children under 18 (or any younger age, to the extent required under applicable laws) are prohibited from using the Service. In the event that we become aware that a user under the age of 18 has shared any information, we will discard such information. If you have any reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has shared any information with us, please contact our Data Protection Officer at: [dpo@similarweb.com](mailto:dpo@similarweb.com).

**HOW TO CONTACT US?**

If you have any questions, concerns or complaints regarding our compliance with this notice and the data protection laws, or if you wish to exercise your rights, we encourage you to contact our Data Protection Officer at [dpo@similarweb.com](mailto:dpo@similarweb.com).

We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes and will make every reasonable effort to honor your wish to exercise your rights as quickly as possible and in any event, within the timescales provided by data protection laws.

**IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS**

In this section, we provide information for California residents, as required under California privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**”), which requires that we provide California residents certain specific information about how we handle their personal information, whether collected online or offline. Under the CCPA, “_**personal information**_” is any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California resident or household. It does not include publicly available data as defined by the CCPA. This section does not address or apply to our handling of publicly available information made lawfully available by state or federal governments or other personal information that is subject to an exemption under Section 1798.145(c) – (f) of the CCPA.

Except for the Right to Opt-out and the Right of Non-Discrimination, this section does not apply to California residents with whom we transact or communicate solely in the context of providing or receiving a product or service to or from a company that employs such residents or engages such residents as contractors.

**CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT, DISCLOSE, AND SELL**

We have set out above the categories of personal information (as defined by the CCPA) about California residents that we collect. As noted below, we do not sell your personal information or disclose it to third parties for a business purpose. We may disclose each of these categories of personal information to our service providers, who are not permitted to use your personal information except as necessary for performing services on our behalf. We collect these categories of personal information from the sources described in the “WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?”section above, and for the purposes described in the “HOW IS THE DATA USED?” section above. Our collection, use and disclosure of personal information about a California resident will vary depending upon the circumstances and nature of our interactions or relationship with such resident.

Please note that the CCPA defines the term “sale” very broadly to include any exchange of data for consideration of any kind, not simply selling your data for monetary compensation.

**CALIFORNIA CONSUMER RIGHTS**

California law grants consumers certain rights and imposes restrictions on particular business practices as set forth below. California consumers have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell about you.

* **Right to Opt-out of Sale of Personal Information (“Do Not Sell”).**  
    California residents have the right to opt-out of our sale of their personal information. We do not sell your personal information.
    
* **Requests for Copy, Deletion and Right to Know**  
    Subject to certain exceptions, California consumers have the right to make the following requests, at no charge, up to twice every 12 months. Please see “Submitting Requests” for instructions on how to exercise your rights.
    
    * Deletion: the right to request deletion of personal information that we have collected about you, subject to certain exemptions.

* **Submitting Requests.** You can exercise your rights by:  
    (a) Contacting us at +972-3-5447782  
    (b) Emailing us at  [dpo@similarweb.com](mailto:dpo@similarweb.com)
    

When you submit your request, we will take steps to attempt to verify your identity. We will seek to match the information in your request to the personal information we maintain about you. As part of our verification process, we may ask you to submit additional information, use identity verification services to assist us, or if you have created an account on our website or mobile app, we may ask you to sign in to your account as part of our identity verification process. Please understand that, depending on the type of request you submit, to protect the privacy and security of your personal information, we will only complete your request where we are satisfied that we have verified your identity to an appropriate degree of certainty. We will make every reasonable effort to respond to you within 45 days after we receive a verified request. If we are unable to meet this timescale, we will respond as soon as possible over the next 45 day period.

**INCENTIVES AND DISCRIMINATION**

The CCPA prohibits discrimination against California consumers for exercising their rights under the CCPA and imposes requirements on any financial incentives offered to California consumers related to their personal information.

Discrimination: if consumers exercise their rights under CCPA, businesses may not discriminate against them including by denying or providing a different level or quality of goods or services or charging or suggesting that a business will charge different prices or rates or impose penalties, unless doing so is reasonably related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer’s data.

**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA’S SHINE-THE-LIGHT LAW**

Under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83), California residents who provide us certain personal information are entitled to request and obtain from us, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we have shared with third parties for their own direct marketing use. Such requests may be made once per calendar year for information about any relevant third party sharing in the prior calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to [dpo@similarweb.com](mailto:dpo@similarweb.com). In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident. Your right to obtain information regarding any of your personal information we have shared with third parties for their own marketing use was included here solely in order to satisfy legal and regulatory notice requirements, we DO NOT share any of your personal information with third parties for their own marketing use.
