**Privacy Policy Last Update Date:** May 2024  
‍

AMBOSS GmbH is a young company providing high quality services for physicians and medical students as well as learning materials. We want you, as a user of our services, to understand how we use information and what options you have to protect your data. We are aware of the importance and sensitivity of your personal data and thank you for your trust. Handling it responsibly is a major concern for us. If you have any questions about this, please do not hesitate to contact us.

‍

### **1\. Basic information on data processing and legal basis  
‍**

1.1 This privacy policy informs users about the nature, scope and purposes of the processing of personal data by the responsible provider, AMBOSS GmbH (“AMBOSS” or “we”). It applies to data processing in the following areas:  
‍

* The website [www.amboss.com](https://www.amboss.com/) operated by AMBOSS including the registered area of the online knowledge and learning program “AMBOSS” accessible via this website and
* The AMBOSS mobile apps (native mobile apps on iOS and Android).

We inform separately about data processing in the following areas:

    ‍](https://www.amboss.com/us/privacy/applicants)

1.2 We process users’ personal data exclusively in compliance with the relevant provisions of data protection law. In accordance with Art. 13 EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we inform you about the legal basis of our data processing. If the respective legal basis is not mentioned in this privacy policy, the following applies: Legal basis for the processing of personal data with separate consent is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR, legal basis for the processing of data for the performance of a contract and for the implementation of pre-contractual measures is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, legal basis for the processing of personal data to meet our legal obligations is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR and legal basis for the processing of personal data to protect our legitimate interests is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

‍

### **2\. Data sharing**

2.1 First of all, only our employees who are involved in technical, commercial and editorial support receive knowledge of your personal data. In addition, we use external service providers within the scope of the data processing explained in this privacy policy or, if necessary, commission them with certain services. We list the categories of external recipients in detail below:

2.2 Personal data is only passed on to third parties on the basis of legal permits and within the framework of the legal requirements. If we commission service providers with the processing of data within the framework of a so-called “Data Processing Agreement (DPA)”, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.  
‍

2.3 Personal data may also be transferred to servers outside the EU or to trusted third parties based outside the EU. If there is no EU Commission decision on an adequate level of data protection for the country in question, the transfer will take place on the basis of so-called EU standard contractual clauses, which aim to ensure that your rights and freedoms are adequately protected and guaranteed. You should be aware that many countries do not provide the same level of legal protection for personal data that you enjoy in the EU. While your personal data is located in another country, it may be accessed by courts, law enforcement and national security authorities of that country in accordance with its laws.

‍

### **3\. Purposes of data processing and legal bases  
‍**

3.1 Informational use of the website  
‍

During the informational use of the website, we collect the personal data that the browser transmits to our server in order to ensure the stability and security of our website. This is our legitimate interest, so that the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.  
‍

This data is: IP address, date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), content of the request (specific page), access status/HTTP status code, amount of data transferred in each case, website from which the request came, browser, operating system and its interface, language and version of the browser software.  
‍

This data is also stored in log files. They are deleted when their storage is no longer necessary, at the latest after 14 days.  
‍

3.2 Hosting and provision of the website  
‍

We use AWS to host our website. The provider is Amazon Web Services EMEA Sàrl, Avenue John F. Kennedy 38, 1855 Luxembourg. The provider thereby processes the personal data transmitted via the website, e.g. content, usage, meta/communication data or contact data, on servers in the EU. Further information can be found in the provider’s privacy policy at https://aws.amazon.com/de/privacy/?nc1=f\_pr.  
‍

We also use the following content delivery networks:

* Cloudfront: For description see section 4.1.1.
* Cloudflare: For description see section 4.1.1.
* Cloudinary: For description see section 4.1.1.

The hosting as well as the use of a content delivery network are technically necessary to provide images and other website resources. The legal basis of the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.  
‍

3.3 Provision of contractual services / user account  
‍

3.3.1 We process inventory data (e.g. names, addresses and other contact data), contract data (e.g. payment information, service used) for the fulfillment of our contractual obligations and services pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR as well as for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which we are subject pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR in connection with commercial, trade or tax law, insofar as we are obliged to record and store your data.  
‍

3.3.2 In order to be able to use our offer to the full extent, registration is required. As part of setting up a corresponding user account, you must provide a password in addition to your e-mail address. This information is used for login and secure identification on our site. If the registration and/or login takes place via a single sign-on procedure (SSO) of an institution (e.g. university or clinic), we will forward you to the respective website of the institution for the purpose of logging in and will transmit the e-mail address entered by you on our website for this purpose to the institution. After a successful login, information about you, namely your first and last name, affiliation with the institution and e-mail address, will be transmitted to us by the institution for the purpose of identification and processed by us for the provision and use of our offer on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. This data is linked to the AMBOSS user account.  
‍

3.3.3 We may also ask you for additional personal data such as first and last name, intended specialty, university, address or gender, e.g. as part of a survey or within your user account. Unless this information is necessary to provide our services, it is always voluntary. We use this information on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR to tailor our services to you.  
‍

3.3.4 During registration and each login of your user account as well as the use of our online services, we store the IP address and the time of the respective user action. The storage is based on our legitimate interests and the interest of users in protection against misuse and unauthorized use in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.  
‍

3.3.5 If you have created a user account with us and use our online knowledge and learning program “AMBOSS”, we automatically collect usage statistics regarding the exam/learn results of our online knowledge and learning program and the pages visited within our platform. This information is used for statistical evaluation of your personal learning needs. Anonymized overall statistics are created for this purpose.  
‍

3.4 Contact form

For questions of any kind, we offer you the possibility to contact us via a provided form. In doing so, it is necessary to provide a valid e-mail address so that we know from whom the inquiry originates and so that we can answer it. Further information can be provided voluntarily. The data processing for the purpose of contacting us is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b and f GDPR for the appropriate response to your request.  
‍

3.5 Newsletter

3.5.1 If you have expressly consented in accordance with Art. 6 (1) a GDPR, we will use your e-mail address to send you our newsletter on a regular basis. Insofar as the contents of the newsletter are specifically described within the scope of the registration for the receipt of the newsletter, this information is decisive for the consent of the user. In addition, our newsletters contain information about our services, offers, promotions and our company. The provision of a valid e-mail address is sufficient for the receipt of the newsletter.  
‍

3.5.2 For newsletter registration, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure, i.e. we will only send you a newsletter by e-mail if you have previously expressly confirmed that you want us to activate the newsletter service. For this purpose, we will send you a notification e-mail and ask you to confirm that you would like to receive our newsletter by clicking on a link contained in this e-mail.  
‍

3.5.3 With the registration for the newsletter we store your IP address and the date of registration. This storage serves as proof of your registration for our newsletter.  
‍

3.5.4 You can revoke your consent to receive the newsletter at any time. The revocation can be done via a link in the newsletter itself, in your user account or by sending a message to the contact options above.  
‍

3.5.5 If you have already used our services, we may send you information about our own similar goods and services by e-mail. The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest of direct advertising according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. You can object to this use of your e-mail address at any time with effect for the future free of charge via a link in the e-mail itself, in your user account or by sending a message to the contact options above.  
‍

3.6 AMBOSS network  
‍

3.6.1 You have the option of making individual personal data entered in your user profile (e.g. first name, last name, e-mail address, university, clinic) and other information (e.g. your own additions) retrievable and findable for other users. It may be possible to restrict the accessibility and retrievability of individual or all data and information to certain user groups and to release it only for them.  
‍

3.6.2 The release of your personal data and information to other users is always on a voluntary basis, i.e. with your express consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a GDPR. You can (partially) deactivate or activate this service in your user profile by making all, none or individual data and information retrievable and discoverable for all, none or, if applicable, only certain users by making the appropriate settings.  
‍

3.6.3 If you (partially) activate your profile for the AMBOSS network and can thus be found by other users under the released data, we will inform you by e-mail or via the user account in case of a contact request by another user.  
‍

3.7 AMBOSS Score Predictor

‍

The AMBOSS Score Predictor gives you the option of submitting your practice exam scores to us so that we can provide you with your expected USMLE score. The release of your practice exam scores and other related personal data is always on a voluntary basis. We use this data to predict your USMLE score. We may also use this data to improve our score prediction algorithm. In both cases, the legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest of providing you the score prediction service according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

‍

3.8 Comments and contributions  
‍

When users enter comments or other contributions, their IP addresses are stored on the basis of our legitimate interests according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. This is done for our security, in case someone posts illegal content.

There is a legal obligation to obtain and document your consent to access your terminal device and to process data based on this consent.  
‍

3.9.5 Insofar as the processing of information on your terminal device is absolutely necessary to enable the use of our website or apps expressly requested by you, the storage or access is carried out on the basis of Section 25 (2) No. 2 TDDDG (New German Telecommunications-Telemedia Data Protection Act) or the corresponding European Union member state implementation regulation for Article 5 (3) Sentence 1 of the ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC, amended by 2009/136/EC). Any further processing of information on your terminal device will be based on your consent in accordance with Section 25 (1) of the TDDDG (New German Telecommunications-Telemedia Data Protection Act) or the corresponding European Union member state implementing provision for Article 5 (3) sentence 2 of the ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC, as amended by 2009/136/EC). The aforementioned legal bases of the GDPR then apply to the further processing of the personal data obtained through this. Companies located in third countries are also involved in the processing of your data in accordance with section 2.4. Insofar as companies located in the EU or companies located in third countries are also involved in the provision of services in the case of data hosted in the EU, this will also take place in accordance with section 2.4.

**Google Ads, Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager**

We use marketing and remarketing services on our website in the Google Marketing Platform of Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow Street, Dublin D04 E5W5, Ireland (“Google”). These services allow us to display advertisements in a more targeted manner in order to present page visitors with ads that are tailored to their interests. Through remarketing, page visitors are shown ads and products for which interest has been identified on other websites in the Google network.  
‍

For these purposes, code is executed by Google when our website is called up and so-called (re)marketing tags are integrated into the website. With their help, an individual cookie or comparable technology is stored on the device of the site visitor. The cookies can be set by various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. This file records which websites page visitors have visited, what content they are interested in and which offers they have clicked on. In addition, technical information on the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other details on the use of the website are stored. All data of the site visitors are processed only as pseudonymous data. Google thus does not store any names or e-mail addresses. All ads displayed are thus not targeted to a person, but to the owner of the cookie.  
‍

We use Google Tag Manager to integrate Google Analytics in a data-saving way and to shorten the IP address, for example.
