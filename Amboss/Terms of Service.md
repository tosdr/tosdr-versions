**Welcome to** [**www.amboss.com**](https://www.amboss.com/) **(the “Website”). The following terms, policies and conditions (these “Terms”) represent the entire contract between you and AMBOSS with respect to the Website and the fee-based subscription therein. By entering the website and using the products, services, and other resources (the “Resources”) made available through** [](https://www.amboss.com/)**the website, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms.  If you do not agree to the terms, policies and conditions of these Terms, you may not use the Website or its Resources.**

‍

AMBOSS reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. AMBOSS will inform you by E-Mail about any modifications at least 2 weeks prior to their effective date. You have the right to object to the modifications within two weeks after receipt of the E-Mail. If you do not object to the modifications within two weeks after receipt of the E-Mail, the modifications are considered as being accepted by you. AMBOSS will stress the significance of the two-weeks-period once more in the notification of the modification.

‍

**License**: In consideration of and subject to your payment of the appropriate subscription fee for the Resources you subscribe to, and your agreement to and compliance with the terms, policies and conditions set forth in these Terms, AMBOSS grants to you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to use and access the content posted at the Website (the “Licensed Materials”) according to the terms, policies and conditions set forth in these Terms.

‍

**Term**: The term of these Terms and the license granted in these Terms shall be concurrent with the term of your subscription to the Website (“Term”) and may be terminated earlier than the expiration of your subscription as provided below.

‍

**Access**: You may access the Website during the Term from multiple places, locations, and computers, but you are not allowed to access the Licensed Materials from more than one place, location, or computer at the same time. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website and ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your internet connection are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.

‍

**Access to Licensed Materials**: You shall be allowed to use the Licensed Materials for the specific product(s) to which you have subscribed. Each product has its own subscription fees and duration. You are not allowed to access the content of products that you have not subscribed to. Subscribing to one product does not mean that you will have access to all products.

‍

**Fee Increase:** AMBOSS reserves the right to increase fees for any services, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent subscription term.

‍

**Member Account/Password and Security**: You must complete AMBOSS’s registration process in order to subscribe to and use the Resources by providing us with current, complete, and accurate information as prompted by the registration form. You also will choose a password and a User name. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify AMBOSS immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. AMBOSS will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. Furthermore, you could be held liable for losses incurred by AMBOSS or another party due to someone else using your account or password.

‍

**Conclusion of contract/Subscription Term**:

Any display or presentation of the resources and License-Materials shall not constitute a binding offer by AMBOSS. Rather you have the option to submit a binding offer for the conclusion of a contract by clicking the button “Purchase” after completing the online order process. After submission of the offer, AMBOSS will send an order confirmation to you by E-Mail. The order confirmation constitutes the acceptance of your offer by AMBOSS.

‍

The license granted to you under these Terms includes the right to use and access the Licensed Materials for the product(s) you have subscribed to for the subscription period you initially choose. At the end of this period, your right to use and access the Licensed Materials will expire automatically, unless you renew your subscription under the terms, policies and conditions then current. These Terms and your license to use the Licensed Materials are also subject to termination by AMBOSS, at its sole and absolute discretion, if you fail to comply with any term, policy, or condition in these Terms.
