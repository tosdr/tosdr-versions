Terms of Service
================

Welcome to Codecademy, the website and mobile service of Codecademy LLC (“Codecademy,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Codecademy Privacy Policy , whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

1\. Use of Our Service
----------------------

Codecademy provides an online interactive platform for taking and creating coding classes.

### A. Eligibility

This is a contract between you and Codecademy. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Codecademy Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You must be 16 years or older to use the Services. If you are less than 18 years of age and would like to register to use any part of the Services, please ask your parent or legal guardian to review and agree to these terms before you use any part of the Services, or ask them to complete the purchase or registration on your behalf. Supplemental terms and conditions may apply to some Services, such as rules for a particular competition, promotion, service or other activity, or terms that may accompany certain content accessible through the Services. Supplemental terms and conditions will be disclosed to you in connection with such competition, service or activity. Any supplemental terms and conditions are in addition to these terms and, in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Codecademy.

### B. Codecademy Service

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service. Codecademy reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Codecademy Content (as defined below). Codecademy may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.

### C. Codecademy Accounts

Your Codecademy account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to Codecademy with a third-party service (for example, Facebook or Twitter), you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.

You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Codecademy immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Codecademy will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your “account settings” page. By providing Codecademy your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your “account settings” page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

### D. Pro Accounts

A job-readiness checker is available to our Pro users, allowing the instant generation of “job reports” with a predictive score on “how ready” a learner might be to apply to specific real job postings. The job reports are generated using proprietary data Codecademy has on a learner’s learning progress and optional user uploaded past professional experiences. This tool bridges the “last mile” gap between learner progress made through completing content on Codecademy and the potential success of applying to desired jobs. This is an AI-powered feature subject to our team’s policy on responsible use of AI. We may place daily limits per user caps on how many Job Reports a user may generate.

### E. School Accounts

The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before receiving personal information from children under 13. Because Codecademy provides the Service to School to benefit and enhance the School’s curriculum, CODECADEMY RELIES ON SCHOOL TO OBTAIN AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE CONSENT, IF NEEDED, TO COLLECT STUDENT INFORMATION. School represents and warrants that School has the authority to provide consent for Codecademy to collect information from students before allowing students under 13 to access our Service, and that School has provided appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding School’s sharing of Student Data with service providers such as Codecademy. We recommend that School provide a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.

### F. Service Rules

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS AGREEMENT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. Codecademy makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.

15\. Governing Law and Arbitration
----------------------------------

### A. Governing Law.

You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in New York; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Codecademy, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York County, New York for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.

### B. Arbitration.

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM CODECADEMY. In the unlikely event that Codecademy has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Codecademy claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms of Service, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (“JAMS”) under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in New York County, New York, unless you and Codecademy agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Codecademy from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Codecademy’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND CODECADEMY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, .COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

General
-------

### A. Assignment.

This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Codecademy without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

### B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.

Codecademy may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Codecademy in our sole discretion. Codecademy reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Codecademy is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Codecademy may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

### C. Entire Agreement/Severability.

This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Codecademy in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Codecademy concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.

### D. No Waiver.

No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Codecademy’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

### E. Government Use Rights.

If the Service is licensed to the United States government or any agency thereof, then the Service will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the Service and any accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms of Service and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms of Service.

### F. Contact.

For legal notices please mail or serve us at 200 Broadway, New York, NY, 10012. You can also contact us via our [Help Desk](https://help.codecademy.com/hc/en-us).
