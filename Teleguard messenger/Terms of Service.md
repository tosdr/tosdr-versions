### § 3 Website availability

1\. TeleGuard has an availability of 24 hours a day. However, there may be interruptions in availability due to maintenance that is required for the system. Interruptions in availability can occur due to force majeure or other causes for which TeleGuard is not responsible, such as willful intent or gross negligence.

2\. TeleGuard points out:

* that it is technically impossible to make the website available free of errors of any kind and that TeleGuard therefore assumes no responsibility for it,
* that errors can lead to the website being temporarily switched off,

### § 4 Protection of personal data

The TeleGuard guideline for protecting the privacy of its users meets a very high level of requirements. TeleGuard does NOT collect any data, neither when using the search engine nor when using the user account.

Registration is limited to email address and password, so that no personal data is stored. Processing information requests and registering for certain services, such as TeleGuard, however, may require the provision of personal data such as surname, first name, contact details and email address. This data is collected and processed by TeleGuard in its capacity as the one responsible in accordance with the regulations for the protection of personal data and our data protection declaration.

The purpose of our privacy policy is to tell you how TeleGuard protects your privacy, in particular:

* the purposes for which we collect some of your personal data and how we use it (e.g. responding to your request for information or application);
* the security measures we use to protect your privacy;
* the duration of storage of your data;
* the rights you have to the personal data you have provided to us and their processing.

For contractual purposes, you agree to receive electronic communication from us and that all consents, notifications, publications and other communication that we communicate to you electronically do not require a written form, unless mandatory legal regulations require another form of communication.

### § 7 Copyright

All texts, images and other information and data published on our website are - unless otherwise stated - subject to the copyright of our site. Any form of reproduction and/or modification may only be carried out with our written approval. Otherwise we reserve the right to take legal action against this violation. All costs that are caused by a violation of the law by a user will be charged to the user.

### § 8 Right of modification

We have the right to change the terms of use at any time. The change will then be published in the forum entry on the website.

ATTENTION!
==========

By downloading and installing this app from the APK you accept the term that if the functionality of the app varies from the official download pages (Google Play and App Store), you waive any claims. You further accept full responsibility for checking for and installing updates.

**Please note that APK installation is not compatible with Play Store installation. This means that the app can only be updated from the same source it was installed from.**

**Also, when updating the application through the APK, we strongly recommend that you make backups. In case of any problems, you can reinstall the application and recover your data.**

ATTENTION!
==========

**Starting in 2024, developers will have to pay even more to bypass the Microsoft Defender warning window on Windows. If you know why you need TeleGuard, just make a few extra clicks when you first install it from the official website.**

Hardly anyone thinks about the fact that the lack of a Microsoft Defender warning window via an unknown source means the developer has to pay a tidy sum to third-party certification companies whose prices and requirements are regularly increased.

Both Linux and Apple macOS provide similar tools for free and directly.

An alternative to buying a CodeSign certificate would be to host the application on the Microsoft Store platform, which is inextricably linked to telemetry and the collection of Windows user data.

As an independent company developing software focused on privacy and online security, we consider this to be merely an artificially created system that serves the purposes of Microsoft and NOT the end user.

Based on the above, we decided to refuse to purchase “empty air” and provide TeleGuard “as is”, leaving the choice to the user.

[_MS Windows (8.0+)_](https://pub.teleguard.com/teleguard-desktop-latest.exe) [![](/icons/close.svg)](javascript:void();)

Two options are available for installation. An installation from the Snap Store (recommended) with the benefit of an automatic update, or from a deb package with external dependencies downloaded from public locations (in this case the application can only be updated manually).

* To install the application via SNAP, run the command  
    sudo snap install teleguard-desktop  
    in the terminal, or click the button to access the web version of the Snap Store.
* To install the application from a deb package, download the file using the button below and then open it using either "Install Applications" or "Install Software" (right-click on the .deb file, select "Open with...", then "All Applications" and select "Install Applications"/"Install Software" from the list). In the window that appears, click "Install ". All necessary dependencies will be automatically downloaded from the public locations.
