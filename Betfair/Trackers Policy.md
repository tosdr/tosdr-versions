Why do we use cookies?
----------------------

Cookies are used by our websites to improve your online experience and to ensure that relevant content and functions are delivered and used more effectively.

We use both session cookies and persistent cookies to perform various functions across our sites.

Session cookies are downloaded to your device temporarily for the period that you browse a particular website; these cookies might allow you to navigate between pages more efficiently or enable websites to remember the preferences you select.

-------------------

Cookie Type

Third Party Marketing / Targeting Cookies

Purpose

These cookies are used to deliver Flutter Entertainment plc group advertisements relevant to you, based upon your interests.

They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.

More information

These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the products you have selected. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose and to measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.

* • To perform geotargeting, which allows our adverts to be displayed on third party webpages, based upon your location;
* To perform site retargeting. A retargeting pixel (a tiny unit of code) on our webpage leaves a cookie in the user’s browser, which causes our adverts to be displayed or to not be displayed to you when you visit certain websites within the retargeting network (e.g. Google Display Network); and
* To perform search retargeting, which allows our adverts to be displayed on third party webpages, based upon your previous web search activities.

These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies, or targeting cookies. Please note that no personal data is collected, an advertiser is unable to associate the cookie with a particular individual's name, address or other personal information.

These cookies are placed by third party advertising networks with our permission.
