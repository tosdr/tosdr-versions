How is the information shared
-----------------------------

Your personal information may be transferred or disclosed to any company within the Group or, subject to appropriate agreement, to third parties, for the processing of that personal information based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentially and security measures.

### Within the Group:

There are a number of situations where the Flutter Group companies may use your information, in particular where those Group companies provide support services to Betfair in the areas of marketing, customer services, the prevention of crime, helping to reduce gambling related harm, the provision of betting and gaming services, and to meet legal and regulatory obligations.

Specifically in relation to safer gambling, where you apply a Self-Exclusion from Betfair to an account registered in the UK, British Crown Dependencies or Gibraltar, we will also share your information with the other Flutter Group brands that operate in the UK - Paddy Power, Sky Betting & Gaming and Pokerstars. This action is performed by automatically checking whether accounts with your registered details are held on these other brands, and, where accounts are identified, they will be proactively closed. Such processing will always be performed with the highest regard to the privacy and security of your data. For further information, please visit our Responsible Gambling Centre

Additionally, we may share personal data with the Flutter Group as part of our group internal reporting and assurance, in order to facilitate business efficiency and improvements including, but not limited to research across our group, testing of systems and/or suppliers, risk management, the provision of technology, finance or security support, and the development of new products and tools.

We may also in the future share personal data with other members of the Flutter Group for purposes that are related to and compatible with those set out in this Statement. Finally, where we are required by law or regulation to share personal data to members of the Flutter Group for reasons beyond those set out in this Statement, we will be required to do this.

### Our third-party service providers & partners:

The Group may, from time to time, retain trusted third parties to process your information to provide us with services globally, including for customer support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis, research and surveys. As part our agreements with our partners, we may be required to share your information for the purposes of calculating fees and benefits owed.

### Regulatory or Sporting body

Your personal information including, but not limited to, your registration details, betting records, records of payments, device information etc., may also be disclosed to any regulatory or sporting body (with whom the Group has agreements (Memoranda of Understanding or "MOUs") for the sharing of such data) in connection with policing the integrity or enforcing the rules of a sport or game and/or prevention and detection of crime and where the Group considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that you may be involved in a breach of such rules or the law, have knowledge of a breach of such rules or the law or otherwise pose a threat to the integrity of the relevant sport or game based upon our assessment of your betting behaviours or it may be based on information provided to us by a regulatory or sporting body. Those bodies may then use your personal information to investigate and act on any such breaches in accordance with their procedures.

### International Transfers

Some of the third-party providers we use, as well as companies within the Flutter Group, are based in, or carry out their activities in, countries outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA’) and/or outside the UK.

Countries outside the EEA and UK do not always have strong data protection laws. This means that, unless your personal data is being transferred to a country where the European Commission or UK has determined there to be an adequate level of protection, we have to put in place additional protections to ensure that your personal data is protected to the same level as it is within Europe or the UK.

We put these additional protections in place by using standardised contractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission (for transfers outside the EEA) and the Information Commissioner’s Office (for transfers outside the UK). Where necessary, we also put in place any additional contractual measures required by local law in any of the countries in which we operate. As and when required, we will also put additional technical or organisational measures in place to ensure that your data is kept safe.

### Other circumstances in which we share your personal data

Apart from the functions set out in this policy, we do not share your personal information with third parties except where we are compelled or permitted by law to do so. These circumstances are rare, but may require us to share information with the police or other law enforcement agencies, the courts, statutory authorities (e.g. in connection with tax matters) and sporting bodies (in connection with sporting integrity issues) in any of the countries in which we operate.

  

Where necessary to protect or defend our rights and interests, resolve disputes, respond to what we consider to be incorrect or misleading information provided to a media outlet, or enforce our agreements, we reserve the right to share personal data with regulators, external legal advisors, debt recovery and tracing agencies, and media outlets, although again these circumstances are rare.

  

If ownership of all or part of our business changes or we undergo a reorganization or restructure, we will transfer your personal information to the new owner or successor company so we or they can continue to provide the services you have requested.

  

Whenever we share personal information, and whatever the circumstances, we will always do so legally and with due regard to your privacy. If we receive a request from law enforcement or other statutory bodies, we do not disclose personal information without a warrant, court order or other legally valid proof of authority.

* Right to restrict processing of personal data: You have the right in certain circumstances to request that we suspend our processing of your personal data.

You can exercise this right by using the unsubscribe link found in the marketing communication that you receive from us

Other useful privacy & data security related matters
----------------------------------------------------

### Retention

We retain personal information for as long as we reasonably require it for legal or business purposes.

### Security

We recognise that online security and data protection is an area of vital importance for all our customers, so it is important to us that you have confidence in the security of your personal details before you register an account. We are committed to employing security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and to prevent accidental or unlawful processing, disclosure, destruction, loss, alteration and damage. Our technological security solutions are very advanced and are governed by a mature framework. Our approach is focused on preventing risks. In order to help us in this regard, we employ pseudonymization and encryption whenever possible to reduce the impact of any potential incidents. As the security of some communications via the internet is not completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you disclose using your internet connection. You accept the inherent security implications of using the internet and the Group will accept no liability for any direct, consequential, incidental, indirect, or punitive losses or damages arising out of such an occurrence.
