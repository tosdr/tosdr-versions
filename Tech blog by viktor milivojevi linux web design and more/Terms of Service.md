It was designed as a response to the nation's prior use of Red Hat Linux and later, a modified Windows XP with North Korean language packs. The latest version of Red Star OS, Version 3.0, was released in the summer of 2013. Screenshot of the desktop of Red Star OS 3.0, localized with North Korean terminology and spelling One of the standout features of Red Star OS is its modified Mozilla Firefox browser, known as Naenara, which means "My country" in Korean.

### [Why Void Linux is the Best Linux Distro and Why You Should Use It](https://blog.milivojevic.in.rs/2022/12/why-void-linux-is-best-linux-distro-and.html)

Void Linux is an independent Linux distribution that stands out from the trillions of other existing distributions. Unlike other distributions, Void is not a modification of an existing distribution, but has been written from scratch. This allows it to focus on stability rather than being a bleeding-edge distribution. Furthermore, the package manager and build system have also been written from scratch, providing more control over the software installed in the system. The Void package manager, xbps, is one of the main features of the distribution. It allows users to quickly install, update, and remove software. It also provides detection of incompatible shared libraries and dependencies while updating or removing packages, making it more reliable and secure. Additionally, xbps-src can build software natively or cross compile for the target machine. Void Linux also uses runit as its init system and service supervisor, providing a simple and effective approach to initialize the system wi
