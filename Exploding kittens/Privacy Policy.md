If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has uploaded personal information to our site without your consent, you may contact us at [privacy@explodingkittens.com](mailto:privacy@explodingkittens.com).

The categories of sources from which we collect personal information and our business and commercial purposes for using personal information are set forth above.  
  
**“Sales” of Personal Information under the CCPA** For purposes of the CCPA, Exploding Kittens does not “sell” personal information, nor do we have actual knowledge of any “sale” of personal information of minors under 16 years of age.  
  
**Additional Privacy Rights for California ResidentsNon-Discrimination.** California residents have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of their rights conferred by the CCPA.  
  
**Authorized Agent.** Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. To designate an authorized agent, please contact us as set forth in “Contact Us” below and provide written authorization signed by you and your designated agent.  
  
**Verification.** To protect your privacy, we will take the following steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. When you make a request, we will ask you to provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include asking you to answer questions regarding your account and use of our Services.  
  
If you are a California resident and would like to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, please contact us at [privacy@explodingkittens.com](mailto:privacy@explodingkittens.com). We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws.  
  
**Referral and Similar Incentive Programs.** As described above in How We Use the Information We Collect (“Sharing Content”), we may offer referral programs or other incentivized data collection programs.

(The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s data to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately becomes a user and uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program.  
  
**Accessibility.** This Privacy Policy uses industry-standard technologies and was developed in line with the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1. If you wish to print this policy, please do so from your web browser or by saving the page as a PDF.
