Privacy Policy
==============

1\. Who are we and what do we do?
---------------------------------

Hello! We’re jumping with joy to see you have decided to use our services and products (which we will refer to as the “Services” or the “Platform”).

Privacy is important to us, and it’s our policy to respect your privacy for any information we may collect across our website, Tryst.link, and any services we may own and operate.

This document describes the information we collect, how we use it, how we store it and whom it is shared with.

If you have any issues, questions or concerns with our Privacy Policy, please contact us through hello@tryst.link. Please be advised that any explanation we provide cannot be considered legal advice.

By using Tryst.link, you are agreeing to the [Terms of Service](https://tryst.link/terms), [Advertising Policy](https://tryst.link/advertising-policy), [Code of Conduct](https://tryst.link/code-of-conduct), and [Privacy Policy](https://tryst.link/privacy).

2\. What information do we collect?
-----------------------------------

We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent matter. We collect and process information about you only where we have legal basis for doing so.

There are three basic ways we collect information:

* Information you choose to give us.
* Information we get automatically when you use our services.
* Information we get from third parties.

Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).

We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security.

When necessary, we will retain your personal information to comply with legal obligations (such as payment processor compliance, financial record keeping, etc) or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

### Information you choose to give us

When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. [You can read more about our data retention policies in our data handling explainer](https://help.tryst.link/en-gb/18/149).

Most of our services require you to create an account, so we may need to collect information for compliance purposes and to enable features, such as but not limited to;

Unique username, email address, verification data, payment information, your date of birth, your password, phone number, social media handles, photos and profile content.

**Credit Card Information:** We do not store any Credit Card numbers on our servers, we simply transmit them over to our trusted payment provider via encrypted means, following the industry standards, including 3DSecure2 where available from the card issuer.

### Information we automatically get when you use our services

When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. For example, we know you have searched for certain terms, viewed content, and posted a comment. Below is a more detailed explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:

* **Usage information.** We collect information about your activity through our services. For example:
    * how you interact with the services, such as which pages, what categories you browse and what pages you consult.
    * how you communicate with the other users, such as the time, date, sender, recipient of a message, the number of messages you exchange with other users.
* **Device Information.**
    * We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information.
    * We also collect device information that will help us diagnose and troubleshoot problems in the event you experience any crash or other problem while using our services.
* **Location Information.** When you use our services we may collect information about your location.

That information includes, but is not limited to, details about how you’ve used our services, device information, such as your web browser type and language, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, pages you visited before navigating to our services, cookies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.

### Information we automatically get when you use our services

We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For example, if another user has referred you to our services we may combine the information we collect from that user with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other third-party sources and combine that with the information we collect through our services.

3\. Collection and use of information
