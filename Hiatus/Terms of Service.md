Hiatus Service Overview

The Hiatus Platforms include Services for providing personal finance information management services, discovering new services, tracking and managing recurring payments, and assisting individuals who are seeking to reduce the cost of their recurring bills. Please note that the Services are meant only as an aid to assist you in organizing and managing your payments and personal finance information, and as a bill management service used for certain service providers. The Services are not intended to provide any legal, tax or financial advice. Hiatus does not guarantee that use of the Services will result in savings. The Services are intended only to assist you in your financial goals and decision-making from a generalized perspective. You acknowledge and agree that your recurring payments and buying preferences are unique, and that before any information, advice, recommendations or other content you obtain through the Hiatus Platforms is implemented or acted upon, you must determine whether any product, service or recommendation is best suited for your individual needs and financial situation.

Bill Negotiation and Bill Cancellation Services – Authorization

By signing up to and/or using our bill negotiation and bill cancellation service and providing personal information and third party plan information in connection therewith, you authorize Hiatus and all of its authorized agents to:

* negotiate and communicate with your monthly service providers as an authorized agent on your behalf in an effort to lower or cancel your future service provider bills;
* use the information you provide us to negotiate and communicate with your service providers
* act on your behalf with these service providers; and
* make changes to your account(s) in order to achieve bill savings, including, but not limited to, changes to the length of your contract with the third party provider and changes to the specific services you receive from that third party provider.

Without limiting the foregoing, once we enter into negotiations, you authorize and consent to all discounts Hiatus obtains if the negotiation does not reduce the quality of your existing service. By default, you consent to Hiatus improving the quality of your service if it does not increase your cost of service. It is your responsibility to communicate all desired restrictions for a negotiation prior to the start of the negotiation. If you do not communicate any such restrictions, it is our right to assume there are no restrictions.

Fees for Services; Payments

By using Hiatus, and selecting any Services that we offer for a fee, either on a one-time or subscription basis, you accept the cost of the Services and authorize Hiatus to charge your account(s) for all costs thereof. If Hiatus is unable to collect your payment, in addition to any other remedies available to Hiatus under applicable law, Hiatus reserves the right to freeze or cancel your account in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to turn delinquent accounts over to collection agencies and/or report overdue balances to credit bureaus, including Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. You authorize us to try to charge your Payment Method (as defined below) again, either in full or in partial increments, if the initial charge is rejected by your bank or card issuer for any reason.

Hiatus Premium. Hiatus Premium gives you access to our bill negotiation service and bill cancellation service. To enroll in our bill negotiation service as the holder of a Premium Account, look for an alert next to the bill you want to negotiate on your account dashboard. Tap on the bill, fill in required information to verify the bill account, and give Hiatus permission to contact the bill provider on your behalf to seek a better cost for your bill when prompted. Please note that Hiatus only seeks to reduce the cost of your bill and will typically not seek to change your current plan. Hiatus may, but is not obligated to, update your plan if: (i) it is cheaper than your current rate, and (ii) the updated plan consists of an improvement of quality services, in Hiatus’s sole discretion. Hiatus is not able to negotiate every bill, and, for any bill that Hiatus does negotiate, Hiatus makes no representation that such negotiation will result in a reduction of cost of the bill. By using our bill negotiation service for the selected bill, you authorize Hiatus, and it’s agents, contractors, licensees, successors, and assigns, the right to:

1. Negotiate and communicate with the bill provider as an authorized agent on your behalf in an effort to lower your future bills with the bill provider;
2. Use the information you provide to us to negotiate and act on your behalf with the bill provider; and
3. Make changes to your account(s) in order to achieve bill savings, including, but not limited to, changes to the length of your contract with the bill provider and changes to the specific services you receive from the bill provider.

Without limiting the foregoing, by using our bill negotiation service for the selected bill, you authorize and consent to all discounts Hiatus obtains with the bill provider for future bills and may result in a reduced quality or features of your existing services. It is your responsibility to communicate all desired restrictions for a bill negotiation prior to the start of your use of the bill negotiation service. If you do not communicate any such restrictions, it is our right to assume there are no restrictions. Hiatus does not provide any debt relief or similar services of any kind, and it is your responsibility to pay any amounts due, incurred, or made outstanding on your bills.

To enroll in our bill cancellation service as the holder of a Premium Account, you may follow the instructions on your account page to allow Hiatus to directly contact the bill provider on your behalf to cancel your service and/or receive a refund for you for your payment of the service or assist you in contacting the bill provider to cancel your service. By allowing Hiatus to directly contact the bill provider to cancel and/or provide you with a refund of your payment for the service, you authorize Hiatus, and its agents, contractors, licensees, successors, and assigns, the right to use the information you provide Hiatus and act on your behalf with the bill provider to cancel your bill and/or to receive a refund for any part of your service. Hiatus is not able to contact every bill provider, and Hiatus makes no representation that Hiatus’s communication with the bill provider will result in cancellation or a refund of any part of your payment of the service.

We reserve the right to change the Services included in Hiatus Premium at any time in our sole and absolute discretion.

If you register a Hiatus Premium account, you agree to pay a recurring subscription fee (the “Subscription Fee”) for your use of Hiatus Premium in the amount determined by the user experience tier you select through the App. We reserve the right to change the Subscription Fee from time to time in our sole and absolute discretion. Hiatus, at its sole discretion, may from time to time allow you to choose to pay an amount that you believe is fair. By selecting a fee amount that is greater than zero dollars ($0), you authorize Hiatus to charge you a recurring payment in the amount and at the frequency you have selected. If Hiatus gives you the opportunity to choose your Subscription Fee, such Subscription Fee shall remain in effect for 12 months and thereafter is subject to change as set forth in these Terms.

You agree to pay the Subscription Fee on a monthly or annual basis, as selected by you when you register for Hiatus Premium. You authorize Hiatus to charge your Payment Method for the Subscription Fee in advance at the commencement of each billing period. When paid monthly, the Subscription Fee is non- refundable, except as otherwise required by applicable law.

We may change the amount, frequency, and debit date of the Subscription Fee from time to time in our sole discretion. We will notify you in advance of any change to the Subscription Fee by sending you an email, by posting a notice on the Hiatus Platforms, and/or by any other method permitted by applicable law. By accessing or using the Services after any change to the Subscription Fee takes effect, you agree to pay the Subscription Fee, as modified.

We may offer a free trial of Hiatus Premium to new users. The duration of the free trial will be specified during sign-up and is intended to allow new users to try Hiatus Premium. If you do not cancel your Hiatus Premium subscription prior to the end of the free trial, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for the Subscription Fee in accordance with the payment terms set forth in these Terms.

You may cancel your Hiatus Premium account at any time by contacting us at support@hiatusapp.com or by cancelling through the Hiatus Platforms. You must cancel your Hiatus Premium subscription before it renews in order to avoid paying the Subscription Fee for the next billing cycle.

Your Authorization for ACH Debits and Credits. By using any fee-based Services on the Hiatus Platforms and selecting electronic debits from your bank account as your Payment Method, you authorize Hiatus to electronically debit and credit your bank account via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”). In addition, if applicable, you authorize Hiatus to correct erroneous debits and credits via ACH. Each use of the Services will reaffirm your authorization to debit that amount from your bank account.

You acknowledge that the electronic authorization contained in this section represents your written authorization for ACH debit transactions and will remain in full force and effect until you notify Hiatus that you wish to revoke this authorization by contacting us via email at support@hiatusapp.com. You understand that Hiatus requires at least three (3) business days prior notice in order to cancel this authorization.

Without limiting the foregoing, selecting electronic debits from your bank account as your Payment Method you authorize Hiatus to electronically debit your Bank Account via ACH (and, if ever applicable, to electronically credit your Bank Account to correct erroneous debits) as follows:

* Amount of Debits: Bill negotiation fees and Hiatus Premium Subscription Fee as described above.
* Frequency of Debits: upon completion of negotiations with respect to bill negotiation fees and once a month or once a year for the Hiatus Premium Subscription Fee, as determined by the user experience tier you select.

You may be charged a service fee for any ACH transactions that result in a returned ACH item, such as but not limited to those caused by insufficient funds in your bank account, closure of your bank account, or if the bank account number or other information you provided is incorrect. We reserve the right to resubmit for collection any ACH debit authorized by you that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds. You must provide a valid bank account to be electronically debited by us. Please be advised that we reserve the right to reject accounts at certain banks for the use of our Services. In addition, we may require additional information and confirmation at our sole discretion.

In addition to any of your other representations and warranties in these Terms, you represent that: (i) your browser is equipped with at least 128-bit security encryption; (ii) you are capable of printing, storing, or otherwise saving a copy of this electronic authorization for your records; (iii) the ACH transactions you hereby authorize comply with applicable law; and (iv) your email address on record with us is yours and that email address is accurate and up-to-date.

Payment Plans. If an invoice is greater than or equal to $100, you may request to be placed on a payment plan by contacting us within 72 hours of the date of invoice. The payment plan will be a 2-6 month plan (as determined by Hiatus) with a minimum charge of $50 per month. You will be charged a one-time set up fee of $9 per payment plan. Payment(s) will be automatically drafted using the payment method we have on file for you. If you do not request to be placed on a payment plan within such 72 hour period, we will charge your designated payment method in full as set forth above. We reserve the right to charge a late payment fee of up to $25 per month for delinquent accounts.

Third Party Service Provider Charges. You are responsible for paying all sums for the services of your third party services providers directly to those service providers.

Financial Information. If you purchase products or Services through the Hiatus Platforms, your financial information, such as your payment method (credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information), is collected and stored by our third party payment processing company (the "Payment Processor"), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable privacy policy. As of the Effective Date of these Terms, Stripe is the Payment Processor used within the Services and its privacy policy is available at www.stripe.com/us/privacy or such other URL designated by Stripe. In order to facilitate your order transactions, we collect and store your credit card and/or debit card type and card number. When you authorize Hiatus to negotiate on your behalf or when you order products using the Services, we may share your billing (including credit card type and last four digits of your credit card number) and purchase information with the applicable merchant and any fulfillment companies.
