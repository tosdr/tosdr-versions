Purchasable Goods
-----------------

#### Returns & Refunds

Most digital items will be accepted for refund when requested within 3 days of initial purchase.

Most Most physical items will be accepted for refund when requested and returned within 30 days of initial purchase.

Returns will be refunded to the original payment method.

**Please note the following exceptions to our return and exchange policy:**

* Sale price or discounted items are final sale and cannot be returned or refunded.
* Physical items returned for refund must be in good condition and sealed in their original packaging. Returned physical goods may be charged a restocking fee.
* Refunds will not be issued for digital purchases that have been downloaded. Exceptions are handled on a case-by-case basis and are issued at our discretion.
* We cannot provide returns for purchases made outside of FAKKU, such as from third-party vendors.
* We do not offer exchanges. Items must be returned and refunded and a new order for the correct items must be made separately.
* If it appears that you are abusing refund requests, we reserve the right to stop offering them to you.

**Additional Information:**

* When processing returns, shipping costs are not refunded to the customer.
* Digital items unlocked with the purchase of a physical item are dependent on the persisted ownership of the physical item. Returning or canceling a physical item purchase will revoke the digital item from your account.
* Access to digital items will be removed from your account once a refund has been initiated.
* At any time we may provide a refund, discount, or other form of compensation to some or all of our users ("reimbursements"). The amount and form of compensation are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of reimbursements in one instance does not entitle you to reimbursements in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide reimbursements in the future, under any circumstances.

#### Pre-Orders

All pre-orders are paid in advance and in full.

Pre-order items will be shipped on the estimated release date listed on the product description. We reserve the right to change or delay a Purchasable Goodâ€™s release date at any time and for any reason.

Please note, that if additional Physical Goods are purchased with a product that has not yet been released, the entire order will be held until all items are in-stock and ready to be shipped.

You cannot pick up pre-ordered items in-person, such as at an event we are selling at, you must wait until the order is shipped.

#### Damaged, Defective or Undelivered Goods

If you receive a damaged, or defective product from us, please [contact us](https://www.fakku.net/contact) to submit a claim for a replacement or refund, depending on the type of item. Proof of the damaged product must be provided with your claim to be accepted.

If a package is shown as delivered but has not been received, please contact the mail carrier and then contact us. If it's determined that the package is lost due to mis-delivery by the carrier or theft, we will replace or refund your order.

If youâ€™re encountering issues with your delivery, please contact the mail carrier and then [contact our support team](https://www.fakku.net/contact) to expedite the resolution of any transit problems with your package.

You have 30 days after the maximum delivery date to submit a claim regarding damaged, defective or undelivered goods. This guarantee applies only to purchases made on FAKKU and not through third-party vendors.

#### Customs, Duties and Taxes

The recipient of any Physical Good purchase must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. The recipient is responsible for understanding the regulations of the shipping address provided for an order. Physical Good orders may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees. You agree that we are not held liable for these taxes, duties, or fees and that these charges are to be borne by the recipient.

#### Third-Party Vendors

Our Purchasable Goods may at times be listed for sale on third-party vendor services. Please note, that purchases of our Purchasable Goods from third-party vendors do not grant you any promotional offers we may have included for the same item on our Services. Exclusive promotions, deals, bonus items, offers, or sales are restricted solely to our Services unless otherwise stated.

Purchasable Goods bought on third-party services do not guarantee you support from our Services. If you have purchased one of our Purchasable Goods from a third-party vendor, they must be the one to offer you support for your purchase. You agree that we are not responsible for purchases of our Purchasable Goods through third-party vendors.

FAKKU Subscription

The payment for your FAKKU Subscription will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription and each month thereafter until you choose to cancel your subscription. We will automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the corresponding calendar day to the start of your paying period. In some cases, your payment date may change, such as in the event that your Payment Method was not successfully settled, or if your starting date begins on a day not contained in a given month. Visit your "Subscription Settings" page on our service to view your next billing date.

For some payment methods, the issuer may charge you fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your payment. Check with your payment method service provider for more details regarding any possible fees.
