---------------------------

### Use of Service

We use your information to provide, personalise, and improve your experience with the Services and to ensure the technical functionality of the Service.

### Research & Statistics

In an effort to better understand and improve the Services for our users, we may conduct research on our user demographics, interests and behavior based on the information we collect.

Security
--------
