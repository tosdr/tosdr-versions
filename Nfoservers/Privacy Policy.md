Privacy policy

**Categories of information that we collect and who we share that information with.**  
  
We collect the first name, last name, and email address from our subscribers in order to uniquely identify each person in our database. We do not share this information with any third party with the exception of our payment processor.  
  
When a credit or debit card is used to pay for a subscription, we additionally collect billing information to include the credit card number and expiration date, address, and phone number of the client. This information is never shared with any third party with the exception of our credit card processor.  
  
If the customer chooses to use Paypal, Paypal may also directly request further information from each subscriber for billing purposes, such as a physical address and credit card information (or other payment method information). Paypal is governed by its own privacy policy that each renter should read when signing up for the subscription at the Paypal website and before entering any private information into a Paypal webpage. Paypal occasionally shares the physical address of a renter with us, but we do not intentionally collect or store this information from it.
