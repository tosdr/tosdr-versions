**2\. Unlimited Voice Plans.** FreeConferenceCall reserves the right to periodically review usage levels of unlimited minute Service plans ("Unlimited Plans") to ensure that you are not using an Unlimited Plan in violation of this Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") and if such abuse or violation is discovered to terminate or adjust the plan as appropriate. In an effort to ensure the best possible experience for all our customers, or subscribers who we determine (in our sole discretion) have violated Sections 3 or 4 of this Acceptable Use Plan. You agree to use the voice portion of your Unlimited Plan for traditional voice calls between two individuals of duration comparable to that of the average individual customer presently utilizing a FreeConferenceCall Unlimited Plan and will not employ methods, or procedures to take advantage of your Unlimited Plan by using the plan excessively or for means not intended by FreeConferenceCall. Excessive use of the voice portion of your Unlimited Plan is defined by FreeConferenceCall as use that materially exceeds the average call volume or duration used by all other FreeConferenceCall customers that have purchased an Unlimited Plan. FreeConferenceCall may terminate your Service or change your Service plan if, in its sole discretion, FreeConferenceCall determines that your use of the voice portion of your Unlimited Plan violates this prohibition or is otherwise "unreasonable" or results in abuse of the Unlimited Plan.

**3\. International Long Distance Service.** If you have purchased an Unlimited Plan, FreeConferenceCall may limit the number of unique international phone numbers your phone will be allowed to call to 20 unique international phone numbers per 30-day Service term; based on the international destinations covered by your plan. In such event, the 20 unique international numbers count will automatically reset when your next 30-day Service term begins, unless you purchase a new Unlimited Plan prior to the start of your next Service term. Please visit our website to learn more about the specific features and offerings of our international plans. All international long distance services included in our Service plans are handled by PLD, LLC ("PLD") and are delineated on your invoices separately from the services provided by FreeConferenceCall. PLD is not affiliated with FreeConferenceCall.

2. Set up routing functionality such that only outbound long-distance traffic is sent over the Unlimited Plan;
3. Engage in any other conduct which is fraudulent or results in significant network congestion or degradation, or interferes with our operations, reputation or ability to provide quality service to our customers;

5. Engage in continuous, repetitive or extensive call forwarding;

9. "Spam" or engage in other abusive or unsolicited communications, or any other mass, an automated voice for commercial or marketing purposes;
10. Use your Unlimited Plan in connection with server devices or host computer applications, automated machine to machine connections, voice relay.
11. Use your Unlimited Plan to relay voice calls not originated from your FreeConferenceCall service; or
