Privacy Policy
==============

**Last Updated: May 22, 2018**

CarrierX, LLC ("CarrierX") is committed to respecting the privacy of all users (“users,” “you”) of our website(s) and mobile applications and the products and services available on such websites and mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”). We have established and implemented this Privacy Statement to inform you of the information we collect from you on in connection with the Services, how we collect and use your information, with whom and for what purposes we may share your information, and the choices you can make about our use of your information.

YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. BY USING THE SERVICES AND PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.

Types of Personal Information We Collect
----------------------------------------

The phrase "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy means contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, mailing address, telephone number) and any other information that personally identifies an individual.

In general, we collect Personal Information in connection with the provision of the Services. There are certain Services that are only provided to users who have established an account with us ("Account"). To register for an Account, we require that you provide certain Personal Information, including your name, email address, mailing address, and phone number. If you are registering for a Service that requires payment, we will also collect payment information, including (i) your name as it appears on the card; (ii) the credit card type; (iii) a valid credit card number; (iv) the date of expiration of your credit card; (v) your billing address; and (vi) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card.

We may also collect Personal Information about you when you sign in to a CarrierX app or website using a social networking account, such as a Facebook account. These social networking sign-in features may also enable a CarrierX account to be created more easily by using the information you provided to the social networking site. By using these sign-in features, the social networking site also will know that you have a CarrierX account. To learn more about the privacy and information collection and sharing practices of a social networking site on which you interact with CarrierX, please refer to the privacy policy for that social networking site.

We may also collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily when you correspond with us or interact with the Services, such as phone device contacts. We may combine your Personal Information with information we receive offline, such as when you interact with our customer service group, or that we obtain through third party sources.

You can always decline to provide any Personal Information to us—it is your choice, and you are under no obligation to provide Personal Information to us. However, if you decide not to provide such information, then you may not be able to use or purchase the Services. At any point, you may access, review, and modify your Personal Information from your Account, or by contacting us at the number provided below.

To make a request for information we hold about you, how to request access, correct, amend or delete your Personal Data, contact: [privacy@freeconferencecall.com](mailto:privacy@freeconferencecall.com "privacy@freeconferencecall.com") or [privacy@huddle.team](mailto:privacy@huddle.team "privacy@huddle.team") or [privacy@startemeeting.com](mailto:privacy@startemeeting.com "privacy@startemeeting.com") or [privacy@bullhorn.fm](mailto:privacy@bullhorn.fm "privacy@bullhorn.fm"). Please include "My Personal Data" in the subject line. Be sure to state the reason for the request, (i.e., amend my data, port my data or purge my data), along with your name, dial-in number and access code to properly identify your account. The email must come from the registered email address on file for the account.

Such in-session information is protected by the use of end-to-end encryption and only accessible to those users you invite, or with whom you otherwise choose to share information. You will have the ability to record, store, and access information related to your use of the Services, and we will not access this information except as may be necessary to support the Services and anticipate, diagnose, or resolve problems that may limit or disrupt the Services, or as may be required by law. Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide to other users during your use of the Services can be collected, used, maintained, shared, or disclosed by those users, and we are not responsible for the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, or disclosure of data and information by such users.

Types of Anonymous Information We Collect

You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. We do not track users across third party websites and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track signals. We may use your Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance the Services and improve our internal operations and the content of our software. We may combine such data with certain of your Personal Information.
