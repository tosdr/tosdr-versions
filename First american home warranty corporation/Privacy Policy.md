Although no system can guarantee the complete security of your personal information, we take all commercially reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is protected in alignment with all applicable laws and regulations, as appropriate to the sensitivity of your personal information.

How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?
----------------------------------------------

We keep your personal information for as long as necessary in accordance with the purpose for which it was collected, our business needs, and/or our legal and regulatory obligations. If we dispose of your information, we will do so in a way that is secure and appropriate to nature of the information subject to disposal.

Cookies and Related Technology
------------------------------

We may use browser cookies, beacons, pixel tags, scripts, and other similar technologies from time to time to support the functionality of our Sites and Services. A cookie is a piece of information contained in a very small text file that is stored in your Internet browser or elsewhere on your hard drive. Cookies are transferred from our Sites to your computer, phone or tablet, and allow us to identify your device whenever you return to our Sites. These technologies provide a better experience when you use our Sites and Services, and allow us to improve our services. We may also use analytic software, such as Google Analytics and others, to help better understand how our Sites function on your device(s) and for other analytical purposes. To learn more about how Google uses data when you use our Sites, see [How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)(opens in a new tab/window).

Below is an overview of the types of cookies and related technology we deploy, and your choices.

**Browser Cookies.** A browser cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.

Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it refuses all cookies, we may use cookies when you direct your browser to our Sites.

**Beacons.** Our Sites and e-mails may contain small electronic files known as beacons (also referred to as web beacons, clear GIFs, pixel tags and single-pixel GIFs) that permit us to, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other website-related statistics. Beacons in e-mail marketing campaigns allow us to track your responses and your interests in our content, offerings and web pages. You may use the tools in your device to disable these technologies as well.

**Third Party Technology.** Our service providers, advertising partners, and ad networks may also use cookies and beacons to collect and share information about your activities both on our Sites and on other websites and applications. In addition, third parties that are unaffiliated with us may also collect information about you, including tracking your browsing history, when you use our Sites. We do not have control over these third-party collection practices. If you wish to minimize these third-party collections, you can adjust the settings of your browsers or install plug-ins and add-ins.
