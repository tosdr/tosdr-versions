18\. Dispute Resolution
-----------------------

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND LABCORP TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU AND LABCORP CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER.

1. **Arbitration Agreement.** You and Labcorp mutually agree, to the fullest extent of the law, that any Dispute (defined below) shall be arbitrated and finally decided by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) or by calling 800-778-7879), except as modified below or otherwise agreed to. As used in this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between us, including any past, currently pending, existing, or future dispute or disagreement, except: (a) claims by employees of Labcorp entities related to the terms or conditions of their employment; (b) claims for personal physical injury or wrongful death or survival claims arising from or in any way related to clinical laboratory services; and (c) claims for unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. **You and Labcorp agree that you are each giving up, to the fullest extent of the law, any right to have disputes resolved in court before a judge or jury.**
2. **Class Action Waiver.** **You and Labcorp also mutually agree that, to the fullest extent allowed by law, and except as expressly set out below, each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, on an individual basis, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, non-individual, mass, or representative proceeding.** Further, the arbitrator may not join or consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, non-individual, mass, or class proceeding, except as stated below Nothing in these terms should be read to allow class arbitration Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, inapplicable, invalid, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator All disputes with respect to whether any other aspect of this Dispute Resolution provision and its terms is unenforceable, unconscionable, applicable, valid, void or voidable shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator, and not by any court, except as expressly set out below.
3. **Arbitration Procedures.** Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator to decide a dispute (instead of a judge or jury); arbitration allows for more limited discovery than a court case; and the arbitration process and results are subject to limited review by courts In arbitration, you have the right, at your own expense, to be represented by an attorney of your choosing Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court could award, but any award or recovery must be consistent with this Agreement You and Labcorp also agree that any in-person arbitral hearing will occur in the United States in the same county and state as your billing address Any arbitration under this section will be confidential, and documents exchanged may not be used or shared outside of the arbitration process without the prior written consent of the parties or as required by law To the fullest extent of the law, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim, and the arbitrator cannot award relief for, or on behalf of, anyone who is not a party to the proceeding 
    1. Each party retains the right to elect before or within 30 days after arbitration is initiated by either party to have any claims heard in small claims court on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis for a dispute within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction.
4. **Pre-Arbitration Notice and Good Faith Negotiations.** Both you and Labcorp agree that, before initiating any arbitration proceedings of any kind with the AAA, each party will notify the other in writing of any dispute so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute informally. The notice must be specific and individual to you and include: (i) your name, street address, telephone number, and the email address you use or used for the online services; (ii) a brief description of the dispute; (iii) the amount of money (if any) at issue; and (iv) the specific relief sought. The notice must be signed and include the handwritten signature of, as applicable, either you or a Labcorp employee, depending on which party is providing notice. Notice sent by you to Labcorp will be sent to the following email and street addresses: [\[email protected\]](https://www.labcorp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and 531 South Spring Street, Law Department, Burlington, NC 27215. Notice sent by Labcorp to you will be sent to the email and street addresses that you provided to Labcorp. This notice is a requirement and condition precedent to initiating any arbitration proceedings.
    1. If you and Labcorp cannot agree how to resolve the dispute within 45 days after the notice is received by the other party, then either you or Labcorp may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section, commence an arbitration proceeding with a written demand for arbitration that is individual to you and your dispute, including the content set forth above and a handwritten signature.  Any limitations period will be tolled from the date the dispute is noticed to the other side until the expiration of this 45-day period.​​
    2. Compliance with this Pre-Arbitration Notice and Good Faith Negotiations provision (paragraph D) is an issue for a court to resolve, not the arbitrator.
5. **Arbitration Fees.** The party initiating the arbitration will pay any filing, case initiation, or arbitrator fees, up to the amount that would be required to pursue the same claim in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina (currently, $402.00). For individual damages claims with less than $25,000 at issue, Labcorp will pay the additional, reasonable fees and costs of arbitration, not including attorneys’ fees.  For claims with more than $25,000 at issue, or where a party seeks injunctive or declaratory relief, the parties will share the fees and costs of arbitration equally.  The parties’ good faith negotiation of reasonable fees with the arbitration provider is authorized as needed.  If the arbitrator determines that your or Labcorp’s claim(s) are frivolous, the party bringing the frivolous claim(s) will reimburse the other party for any amounts that other party paid for the arbitration.
6. **Federal Arbitration Act.** These Terms of Use affect interstate commerce, and the interpretation and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution provision will be substantively, procedurally, and exclusively governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, except as modified by these terms of use.
