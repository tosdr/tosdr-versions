### Cookies and Our Use of Tracking Technologies

Labcorp tracks visitors to our Website by collecting usage data using various methods, tools, and technologies to store or collect information about Your use of and access to our Website (“tracking technologies”). Tracking technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your device. A few of the tracking technologies we may use include the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):

* **Cookies.** A cookie is a unique data file placed on a device when it is used to visit our Website. Cookies help enable Your preferred web experience, allowing Our Website to recognize your device and preferences, and to track Your use of and interest in different parts of our Website.
* **Web Beacons.** Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Website’ pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, or to identify particular articles or links actually viewed.
* **Embedded Scripts.** An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about Your interactions with the Website, such as the links You click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto Your device from our web server or a third-party, is active only while You are connected to the Website and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
* **Browser Fingerprinting.** Collection and analysis of information from Your browser used on Your device, such as Your browser type, version, operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.
* **ETag, or Entity Tag.** A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner, ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
* **Recognition Technologies.** Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about devices, users, and activities on the Website (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user), including session and event recorders, voice to text recognition, etc.).

These tracking technologies are used to (1) enable certain functions and tools on the Website, (2) assist in the navigation of the Website, (3) track resources and data used on the Website, (4) promote Labcorp’s products and services, and (5) remember computer settings. Labcorp also collects other forms of usage data, such as information on browsers used to access our Website, search terms used to find the Website, and traffic referrals and links to our Website. This usage data may not be permanently maintained within our tracking system.

Labcorp also uses the services of Google Analytics and other similar software to analyze traffic to the various Labcorp webpages. Data collected regarding site usage is compiled in aggregate to improve the performance of the site, create a profile of uses, and improve our marketing and advertisements. By accessing our Website, You expressly consent to the use of these tracking technologies, and this data collection and use.

If You do not wish Your information to be included in aggregated data through Google Analytics, You can download and install Google’s “Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on” available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). If You wish to prevent the use of cookies or for Your information to be included in aggregated data through Google Analytics, You must modify the properties on Your web browser for both as described above.

We are giving You notice of the tracking technologies and Your available choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed. You are responsible for managing any preference changes on your device or browser. Generally, certain tracking technologies may be rejected, disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser You use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.

Please be aware that if You disable or remove these tracking technologies some parts of our Website may not work and when You revisit Our Website your ability to limit browser-based tracking technologies is subject to Your browser settings and limitations.

Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms known as “do not track signals.” For instance, some browsers may have such signal options, although they differ as to if the signal is set as default or must be turned on by the user. Further, there is currently no standard as to what sites and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, although we may consider doing so if an understandable and practical standard is developed and widely adopted.
