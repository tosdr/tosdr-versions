Labcorp will use mechanisms for any such transfer as required under applicable law. If You have questions concerning the transfer of Your information, please contact Us using the contact details set out below.

### Third Parties Disclosures

We may share Your Personal Information with agents, contractors, or partners of Labcorp in connection with services that these individuals or entities perform for, or with, Labcorp. We may, for example, provide Your information to agents, contractors, or partners for hosting Our databases, for data processing services, or so that they can mail You information that You requested.

Labcorp will disclose Your information in response to duly authorized information requests of any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or other third party, where We believe such disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect Our rights or the rights of any third party, including to identity or locate anyone for the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. You waive and hold Us harmless from any claims resulting from such disclosures and from any actions taken as a consequence of investigations by either Us or law enforcement authorities.

We will also transfer your information to a third party in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of Our business to which the information relates.

### Information Security and Storage

We reserve the right to take any appropriate legal action, including referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of this Website. We also reserve the right take any action to prevent the unauthorized use of Our intellectual property.

### The Retention of Your Information

We will retain and use Your information to the extent and for a period permitted under applicable law, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our legal agreements and policies, and protect Our property.

We will also retain usage data for internal analysis purposes.

### The Safety and Security of Your Personal Information Also Depends on You

If You choose or are given a user identification code, password or any other information as part of Our security procedures for one of the registration-only sections of the Website, You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your password and user name for the Website and You are responsible for all activities that are carried out under them.

We have the right to disable any user identification code or password, whether chosen by You or allocated by Us, at any time to safeguard your account and data.

Please be aware that while We take appropriate steps to safeguard the security of Your Personal Information, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure and therefore You do this at Your own risk.

Financial information and payment data, including credit card numbers, that You provide to Us via the Labcorp internet bill payment link is encrypted. This information will be accessed only by Labcorp agents and employees and third-party vendors who support Labcorp’s billing operations.

We implement technical and organizational measures to maintain a level of security appropriate to the risk to the Personal Information We process.

To request that Your Personal Information be deleted from Our databases, please see below for more information.

### Cookies and Our Use of Tracking Technologies

Labcorp tracks visitors to our Website by collecting usage data using various methods, tools, and technologies to store or collect information about Your use of and access to our Website (“tracking technologies”). Tracking technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your device. A few of the tracking technologies we may use include the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):

* **Cookies.** A cookie is a unique data file placed on a device when it is used to visit our Website. Cookies help enable Your preferred web experience, allowing Our Website to recognize your device and preferences, and to track Your use of and interest in different parts of our Website.
* **Web Beacons.** Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Website’ pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, or to identify particular articles or links actually viewed.
* **Embedded Scripts.** An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about Your interactions with the Website, such as the links You click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto Your device from our web server or a third-party, is active only while You are connected to the Website and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
* **Browser Fingerprinting.** Collection and analysis of information from Your browser used on Your device, such as Your browser type, version, operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.
* **ETag, or Entity Tag.** A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner, ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
* **Recognition Technologies.** Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about devices, users, and activities on the Website (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user), including session and event recorders, voice to text recognition, etc.).

These tracking technologies are used to (1) enable certain functions and tools on the Website, (2) assist in the navigation of the Website, (3) track resources and data used on the Website, (4) promote Labcorp’s products and services, and (5) remember computer settings. Labcorp also collects other forms of usage data, such as information on browsers used to access our Website, search terms used to find the Website, and traffic referrals and links to our Website. This usage data may not be permanently maintained within our tracking system.

Labcorp also uses the services of Google Analytics and other similar software to analyze traffic to the various Labcorp webpages. Data collected regarding site usage is compiled in aggregate to improve the performance of the site, create a profile of uses, and improve our marketing and advertisements. By accessing our Website, You expressly consent to the use of these tracking technologies, and this data collection and use.

If You do not wish Your information to be included in aggregated data through Google Analytics, You can download and install Google’s “Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on” available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). If You wish to prevent the use of cookies or for Your information to be included in aggregated data through Google Analytics, You must modify the properties on Your web browser for both as described above.

We are giving You notice of the tracking technologies and Your available choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed. You are responsible for managing any preference changes on your device or browser. Generally, certain tracking technologies may be rejected, disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser You use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.

Please be aware that if You disable or remove these tracking technologies some parts of our Website may not work and when You revisit Our Website your ability to limit browser-based tracking technologies is subject to Your browser settings and limitations.

Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms known as “do not track signals.” For instance, some browsers may have such signal options, although they differ as to if the signal is set as default or must be turned on by the user. Further, there is currently no standard as to what sites and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, although we may consider doing so if an understandable and practical standard is developed and widely adopted.

### Internet Links

The Labcorp Website may contain links to a number of sites that may provide useful information. Links contained on the Labcorp Website that transfer You to a non-Labcorp site are not maintained by Labcorp and may contain different information and/or different privacy policies from those of our Company.

Labcorp is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of a non-Labcorp Website. Labcorp does not control, or have any input into, whether our business partners or internet-linked sites, use or accept cookies on their sites.

We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. When We do update it, for Your convenience, We will make the updated Privacy Statement available on this page. Changes and additions to the Privacy Statement are effective from the date on which they are posted.
