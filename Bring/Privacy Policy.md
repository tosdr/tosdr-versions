App ("app") and our website https://www.getbring.com ("website"), how we use and disclose your personal data and how your personal data are protected. This Privacy Notice is for your information purposes only. If and to the extent that we require your consent for the processing of your personal data, we will explicitly ask for your consent aside from this Privacy Notice.  
  
The data controller is**  
  
Bring! Labs AG  
Räffelstrasse 26  
CH-8045 Zürich**  
  
If you have any questions about this Privacy Notice, you may contact us at any time by sending us an email (feedback@getbring.com).

#### What is Bring! App and how can I use Bring! App?

Bring! App is a digital shopping list that allows you to plan your shopping activities. With Bring! you have the possibility to create shopping lists and share them with other people. If you want to, you may obtain information about local offers and bargains directly in the app and look for promotions.  
Bring! App also provides you with ideas and inspires you to try new recipes or read other interesting stories about food.  
With the function "Order list online" you have the opportunity to have the items on the list delivered at your home simply and conveniently.  
If you like, you can also save your loyalty cards in Bring!

#### When does Bring! collect personal data about me?

We collect personal data about you whenever you:

* Download and use our app
* Create an app account to be able to use other app functions (e.g. joint shopping list)
* Visit our website or create an app account via our website, and
* Send us other inquiries.

#### What personal data does Bring! collect about me and why?

####   
Collection and processing of data in connection with the Bring! App

**  
(a) Downloading and using the Bring! App in general**  
Whenever you access and download our Bring! App, we collect from you and process the following personal data:

* Information about the smartphone and Internet connection you used, such as for example device IDs ("Device tokens") and IP addresses
* Advertising ID (e.g. IDFA, Google Advertising ID)
* Recipes, offers and items which interest you and/or which you added to your shopping list
* Country and language  
    

**(b) Creating an app account and using other functions in the Bring! App**  
Whenever you create an app account and use any of the other functions that thereby become available to you, we collect and process the following personal data:

* Information about the smartphone and Internet connection you used, such as for example device IDs ("Device tokens") and IP addresses
* Information about your user account, i.e. user name, user ID and - in coded form - the password to your app account as well as your user default settings in the app
* E-Email address
* Photo (optional)
* Country and language
* Recipes, offers and items which interest you and/or which you added to your shopping list
* Social Account information  
    

**(c) Measuring the success of advertising campaigns**  
The measurement of success of advertising campaigns is based on our legitimate interest in understanding how campaigns and advertisements can be used to improve the advertisements.  
  
For this purpose we use the so-called "Advertising Identifier" (Ad-ID). This is a unique, but non-personalised and non-permanent identification number for a specific device provided by the operating system of the respective mobile end device. The data collected via the Ad-ID is not linked to other device-related information. We use the Ad-ID only to provide you with personalized advertising and to evaluate your use of our advertisements. If you enable the 'no ad tracking' option in your settings (for iOS under "Privacy/Advertising" the option "no ad tracking" or for Android under "Settings/Account/Google/Advertisements"), we can only take the following measures: Measuring your interaction with banners by counting the number of ads of a banner without clicking on it, click rate, identification of unique use, security measures, fraud prevention and error correction. You can reset your Ad-ID anytime in the device settings ("Reset Ad-ID"), then a new Ad-ID is created with no link to the previously collected data.  
**  
(d) Optional functions in the Bring! App  
‍  
1\. Offers**  
By using our Bring! App you have the opportunity to view offers and promotions of various providers (e.g. supermarkets, discounters, drugstores). If you would like to have access to local offers and promotions and separately agree to share your location data with us, your personal data is processed in order to select suitable offers for you and show you shopping opportunities offered by local providers at or near your current location  
  
You can withdraw your separate consent at any time by clicking on one of the following opt-out links applicable to you  
  
If you are an app user in Switzerland and/or an app user with Switzerland as the default setting on the device on which you stored and use our app, you can opt-out at any time via [this link](https://www.kaufda.de/webapp/opt-out?partner=de_bring_production)  
If you are an app user in Germany or France, you can opt-out at any time via this [link](https://www.kaufda.de/webapp/opt-out?partner=de_bring_production). lease note that the functionality "Offers" is generally available to you in an opt-out mode, but in that case we will not be able to show you actual offers in your proximity.  
  
**2\. Loyalty cards**  
You can also use the function to store your loyalty cards (e.g. Payback, Deutschland Card, Migros Cumulus, Cooper Supercard) in your profile. If you want to use this function, we need information about the customer card type, the individual customer number of your card provider and the barcode scanned by you using our integrated barcode scanner. We use the aforementioned data to provide you with this selected service, so you always have your customer card electronically at hand.**  
  
3\. Chefkoch**  
Bring! has a new partner: Chefkoch - Europe's largest food platform. There you can find and collect recipes for every occasion and transfer the ingredients directly from the web or the Chefkoch App to our shopping lists. You can then find the recipes in the inspiration area of your Bring! app.

The information about your use of the website generated by Google Analytics cookies is normally transferred to and stored on a Google server in the USA. On this website Google Analytics was expanded by the code "gat.\_anonymizeIp();" in order to ensure the anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). Thus your IP address is abbreviated beforehand by Google within the EU Member States or other Member States or the European Economic Area.  
  
The complete IP address is transferred to a Google server in the USA only in rare cases and then abbreviated there. Google will use this information in order to analyze your use of the website, to compile reports about the website activities for the website operators and to provide additional services related to your website and Internet use.  
  
The IP address transferred by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not linked to any other data stored by Google. You can prevent the collection of the data generated by Google Analytics cookies which refer to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of these data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)  
  
You can also prevent the data collection by Google Analytics by clicking on the link below. It installs an opt-out cookie which will prevent the future collection of your data when visiting this website: [deactivate Google Analytics](http://javascript:gaOptout())  
  
You will find more information about the conditions of use and about data protection under [http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/en.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/en.html) bzw. unter [https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/](https://www.google.eom/intl/en/policies/).
