**Analytics Services**
----------------------

### **Google Analytics**

Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service offered by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files stored on your computer which allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information about your use of the website generated by Google Analytics cookies is normally transferred to and stored on a Google server in the USA. On this website Google Analytics was expanded by the code "gat.\_anonymizeIp();" in order to ensure the anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). Thus your IP address is abbreviated beforehand by Google within the EU Member States or other Member States or the European Economic Area.  
  
The complete IP address is transferred to a Google server in the USA only in rare cases and then abbreviated there. Google will use this information in order to analyze your use of the website, to compile reports about the website activities for the website operators and to provide additional services related to your website and Internet use.  
  
The IP address transferred by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not linked to any other data stored by Google. You can prevent the collection of the data generated by Google Analytics cookies which refer to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of these data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).  
  
You can also prevent the data collection by Google Analytics by clicking on the link below. It installs an opt-out cookie which will prevent the future collection of your data when visiting this website: [deactivate Google Analytics](http://about:blank).  
  
You will find more information about the conditions of use and about data protection under [http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/en.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/en.html) bzw. unter [https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/](https://www.google.eom/intl/en/policies/).**‍**

### **Firebase Analytics**

We use Firebase Analytics from Google Inc. to analyse user behaviour. Firebase Analytics allows us to analyse screen views, button clicks, in-app purchases and the effectiveness of advertising. It also allows us to determine which features within our application are used frequently or infrequently and to develop the features accordingly.  
  
For these purposes, Firebase Analytics stores the number and duration of sessions, operating systems, device models, region, app runs, app updates or in-app purchases. More information about Firebase Analytics privacy and security can be found at [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy?hl=en](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy?hl=en). 

### **Appsflyer**

To analyse our app, we use Appsflyer from the analytics service AppsFlyer Ltd, 85 Medinat Hayehudim St. Herzliya, Israel ("Appsflyer").

You may object to the collection and storage of your data at any time by unsubscribing at https://www.appsflyer.com/optout.

For these purposes, Offerista stores the actions performed, the session ID, the time, the location and the version of the app.
