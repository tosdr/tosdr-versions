In order to use all features of Bring!, the registration as a User with a user account including a username and a valid email address as well as access to the Internet may be necessary.

In this context, Bring! acts exclusively as an intermediary and service provider for the Dealer and the user, but does not itself become a party to the contract. Users acknowledge and agree that their contract with the Dealer may be governed by the Dealer's General Terms and Conditions and a separate Dealer Privacy Policy, which both are the sole responsibility of the Dealer.  
  
With regard to user content subject to intellectual property rights, the User shall expressly grant Bring! Labs a royalty-free, sublicensable, non-exclusive and worldwide license to use such content in connection with Bring! subject to mandatory legal provisions.

Labs recommends the User to perform a regular data backup of his/her smartphone including Bring!.

By continuing the use of Bring! after changes of these terms of use have been notified, the User shall expressly consent to such changes.

Subject to mandatory legal provisions, the use of Bring! shall be exclusively governed by Swiss laws with Zurich (Switzerland) being the exclusive place of jurisdiction.
