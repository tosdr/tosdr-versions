6. **CUSTOMER DATA**
    
    We assume that all data that is provided by the Customer was taken with the consent. Customer agrees that it will not provide any Sensitive Data to the Service. If Customer discovers that due to human error or otherwise, Customer Data does include Sensitive Data, Customer will promptly notify MarTech Solutions LLC and provide sufficient information to the Service to locate such Sensitive Data and MarTech Solutions LLC will scrub its systems, and the Sensitive Data in its control or possession. As between Customer and MarTech Solutions LLC, Customer owns all Customer Data and except as specifically provided in this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing between the parties, MarTech Solutions LLC has no right to such Customer Data. Customer grants to MarTech Solutions LLC a non-exclusive royalty-free license to access Customer Data in order to provide the Services to Customer and as necessary to monitor and improve the Services.

For the avoidance of doubt, MarTech Solutions LLC may use, reproduce, and disclose Customer Data that is anonymized, de-identified, or is otherwise not reasonably associated or linked to Customer for product improvement. Customer, not MarTech Solutions LLC, will have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all Customer Data.
    
7. **CONFIDENTIALITY**
    
    **Confidential Information.**
    
    Each party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has business, technical or financial information relating to Disclosing Party's business which it has disclosed or may disclose during this Agreement (“Confidential Information”). MarTech Solutions LLC's Confidential Information includes non-public information regarding features, functionality and performance of the Services, as well as all user visible aspects of the Services. Customer's Confidential Information includes information provided by Customer to the Service to enable the provision of the Services as well as all Customer Data. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, including all pricing and related metrics, are each party's Confidential Information.
    
    **Non-Use.**
    
    Receiving Party agrees that it will take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party. Without limiting the foregoing, Receiving Party will take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most important confidential information. Receiving Party agrees (i) not to use any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party for any purpose except to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement and (ii) not to disclose any Confidential Information of Receiving Party to third parties or to such party's employees, officers, agents, contractors or other representatives (“Personnel”), except to those Personnel of Receiving Party who need or have access to such Confidential Information in order to perform works in connection with this Agreement and are subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with those of this Agreement.
    
    **Exceptions.**
    
    Disclosing Party agrees that these confidentiality obligations will not apply to any information that Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the public; (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from Disclosing Party; (c) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party; and/or (d) was independently developed without use of any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Section precludes either party from disclosing the other party's Confidential Information as required by law or a legal process, provided that such party (a) gives the other party prior written notice sufficient to permit the other party to contest the disclosure or seek a protective order (or other confidential treatment) and (b) reasonably cooperates with the other party in limiting the disclosure. In addition, a party may disclose information concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including providing a copy of this Agreement, to any or all of the following: (a) potential acquirers, merger partners, investors and their personnel, attorneys, auditors and investment bankers, solely in connection with the due diligence review of such party by persons and provided that the disclosures are made in confidence, (b) the party's outside accounting firm, or (c) the party's outside legal counsel.
    
    **Return of Confidential Information.**
    
    Promptly following the earlier of (i) the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, or (ii) the request of Disclosing Party, Receiving Party will return to Disclosing Party, or destroy all Confidential Information that are in written, electronic or other tangible form (including, without limitation, all written or printed documents, notes, memoranda, email, or computer memory, whether or not prepared by Receiving Party) to the extent containing or summarizing any portion of the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, all copies and extracts of such Confidential Information. In addition, upon the request of Disclosing Party, Receiving Party will certify to Disclosing Party in writing Receiving Party's and its Personnel's compliance with its obligations pursuant to this Section.
    
    **Redundancy.**
    
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, MarTech Solutions LLC may retain Confidential Information after termination of this Agreement for such period of time agreed to by Customer and MarTech Solutions LLC. To the extent that MarTech Solutions LLC is required by law to maintain copies of Confidential Information, Customer Data, or records related to disclosure or handling of Confidential Information, MarTech Solutions LLC will be under no obligation to destroy such information. Furthermore, MarTech Solutions LLC will be permitted to retain such information, as MarTech Solutions LLC reasonably determines necessary to demonstrate to Customer or any regulatory authority, MarTech Solutions LLC's compliance with this Agreement or any applicable law or regulation. At such time as MarTech Solutions LLC's basis for retaining such information ceases to exist, MarTech Solutions LLC will destroy such information as set forth above.
