### AUTOMATED CALLS, TEXT MESSAGES AND DIRECT MAIL

#### Program Description

ConsumerAffairs provides a matching service whereby the consumer provides information in connection with being matched with a desired service or product. As part of this service, you may be contacted by ConsumerAffairs or by the brand with whom you have been matched pursuant to your request and provision of information on the ConsumerAffairs Website.

#### Consent

When you provide your information on the ConsumerAffairs Website, you consent to be contacted via automated text message, automatic telephone dialing system, or by artificial/prerecorded message at the telephone number you provide, and/or by receiving email at the email address you provide and/or direct mail from ConsumerAffairs or the brand with which you have been matched for the desired product or service.

You expressly consent to receive automated calls, text messages, and/or email regardless of whether you are on any Federal or state DNC (“Do Not Call”) registry or similar list or registry. If you provide your information and we contact you, or you contact us, we may keep a record, including but not limited to telephone recordings, call logs, text logs and emails, of your interaction with ConsumerAffairs.

#### Opting Out

You may revoke your consent for us to contact you by autodialed call, text message, or direct mail at any time. If you no longer wish to receive such communications from ConsumerAffairs, you may opt out by emailing [privacy@consumeraffairs.com](mailto:privacy@consumeraffairs.com) along with the subject line “Opt-Out”. To opt out of receiving text messages from ConsumerAffairs at any time, text STOP to the short code from which the text message was sent to the enrolled mobile device. A confirmation message of your opt out will be sent to your mobile number but no additional messages will be sent to you unless you opt in again.

#### Cost & Carriers

ConsumerAffairs does not charge for toll free calls. However, you may be charged for the minutes you use by your mobile carrier, depending on your wireless plan.

Standard message and data rates may apply. These rates may be changed by your mobile service provider and payable by you to that provider. ConsumerAffairs.com does not impose a separate fee for sending SMS messages.

The content in these messages may not be available and viewable on all carriers. Participating carriers include T-Mobile®, Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, Boost, U.S. Cellular®, MetroPCS, Virgin Mobile, and Cricket. Mobile carriers are not liable for delayed or undeliverable messages.

#### Help

For help with this texting program, text HELP to the short code from which the message was sent to the enrolled mobile device. A confirmation message of your HELP request will be sent to your mobile number along with a link/url to a dedicated webpage on ConsumerAffairs with additional information that may help resolve your issue.

#### Call Masking

By agreeing to participate in Call Masking, you understand that ConsumerAffairs will collect your phone number as entered in the form. However, ConsumerAffairs will not share your phone number directly with a third party. ConsumerAffairs will give the third party a proxy number to contact you with any marketing or service related communications. See example below.

This proxy number is being used for your convenience and may be disabled by you or by ConsumerAffairs after a predetermined amount of time. To disable the proxy number and stop third parties from contacting you, you may opt out by emailing privacy@consumeraffairs.com along with the subject line “Call Masking Phone Number”.

Example: You submit information to ConsumerAffairs including your phone of #123. ConsumerAffairs matches you with a participating third party but gives that party the proxy phone number of #789. The third party dials #789 and it rings to your phone number. However, once you choose to stop the phone calls, then the proxy phone number will be disconnected from your phone number and the calls will stop. Also, ConsumerAffairs will automatically disconnect the proxy phone number from your phone number after 30 days from the date you provide your information to ConsumerAffairs.

You and ConsumerAffairs agree to try to attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation upon notice of a dispute for a period of 60 days. If you and ConsumerAffairs do not resolve the dispute in such 60 day time period or in small claims court, then you or ConsumerAffairs may commence arbitration. You and ConsumerAffairs agree that a dispute will be heard before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. In addition, you and ConsumerAffairs agree that the following rules shall apply to the arbitration proceedings: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; and (b) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the JAMS Arbitration Rules. Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, ConsumerAffairs will pay all other arbitration fees and expenses.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM RELATING TO OR UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES AND/OR THE WEB SITES, AND NO CLASS ACTION ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS OR ANY PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY  SHALL BE PERMITTED. PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.

In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you or ConsumerAffairs related in any way to the Terms of Use, the Services and/or the Web sites be instituted more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.

If a court of competent jurisdiction finds these arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in County of Douglas, Nevada, and you agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any applicable claim or action.
