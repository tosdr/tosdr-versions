#### Call Masking

By agreeing to participate in Call Masking, you understand that ConsumerAffairs will collect your phone number as entered in the form. However, ConsumerAffairs will not share your phone number directly with a third party. ConsumerAffairs will give the third party a proxy number to contact you with any marketing or service related communications. See example below.

This proxy number is being used for your convenience and may be disabled by you or by ConsumerAffairs after a predetermined amount of time. To disable the proxy number and stop third parties from contacting you, you may opt out by emailing privacy@consumeraffairs.com along with the subject line “Call Masking Phone Number”.

Example: You submit information to ConsumerAffairs including your phone of #123. ConsumerAffairs matches you with a participating third party but gives that party the proxy phone number of #789. The third party dials #789 and it rings to your phone number. However, once you choose to stop the phone calls, then the proxy phone number will be disconnected from your phone number and the calls will stop. Also, ConsumerAffairs will automatically disconnect the proxy phone number from your phone number after 30 days from the date you provide your information to ConsumerAffairs.

### DISPUTES

Nevada law, without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof, and controlling U.S. federal law govern any action related to the Terms of Use, the Websites and/or the Services.

You and ConsumerAffairs agree to arbitrate all disputes between you and ConsumerAffairs, except for disputes relating to the enforcement of ConsumerAffairs’ intellectual property. Any disputes between you and ConsumerAffairs relating to the Terms of Use, the Services and/or the Web sites must be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration pursuant to JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (including Interim Measures), or in small claims court in County of Douglas, Nevada. In the event of a dispute, you or ConsumerAffairs must send to the other party a notice of dispute, in writing, setting forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving notice, the facts of the dispute and relief requested. You may initiate proceedings by sending ConsumerAffairs notice to the following address:

ConsumerAffairs  
c/o Consumers Unified, LLC 297 Kingsbury Grade, Suite 1025, Mailbox 4470  
Lake Tahoe, NV 89449-4470  
[privacy@consumeraffairs.com](mailto:privacy@consumeraffairs.com)  
1-866-773-0221  
  

We will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and ConsumerAffairs agree to try to attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation upon notice of a dispute for a period of 60 days. If you and ConsumerAffairs do not resolve the dispute in such 60 day time period or in small claims court, then you or ConsumerAffairs may commence arbitration. You and ConsumerAffairs agree that a dispute will be heard before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. In addition, you and ConsumerAffairs agree that the following rules shall apply to the arbitration proceedings: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; and (b) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the JAMS Arbitration Rules. Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, ConsumerAffairs will pay all other arbitration fees and expenses.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM RELATING TO OR UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES AND/OR THE WEB SITES, AND NO CLASS ACTION ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS OR ANY PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY  SHALL BE PERMITTED. PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.

In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you or ConsumerAffairs related in any way to the Terms of Use, the Services and/or the Web sites be instituted more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.

If a court of competent jurisdiction finds these arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in County of Douglas, Nevada, and you agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any applicable claim or action.
