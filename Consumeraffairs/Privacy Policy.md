Privacy Policy
==============

**Effective Date: August 30, 2023**

**Last Updated: August 30, 2023**

This Privacy Policy, which is part of our [Terms of Use](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/about/terms_of_use/), describes how ConsumerAffairs.com Holdings, LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and discloses Personal Information (as defined below) in connection with your use of the services provided by us (the “Services”) and use of our website (“Site”).

We may change this policy from time to time and will disclose that we have a revised policy by updating the Last Updated date at the top of the policy. If we make material changes, and if we have your email address, we will also notify you by email. Please check this page when you access the services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

1. What Information We Collect
    1.

        1. Identifiers and contact information such as such as name, postal address, phone number, email address, social security number (we only provide social security numbers to finance partners with your consent), or other similar identifiers;
        2. Other demographic information, such as date of birth;
        3. Commercial information, such as information about products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories and corresponding account numbers;
        4. Internet and network information such as browsing/search history, approximate geolocation, browser type, device type and settings, and information regarding an individual’s interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement;
        5. Audiovisual information such as pictures, call recordings, and video footage; and
        6. Inferences drawn from the above categories of Personal Information that relate to your preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes (e.g., topical interests, engagement value).
    2. Usage Data: We do not collect, use, or disclose Personal Information when you use our websites. Keep in mind, however, that we automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on our websites, including collecting the type of web browser you use, the type of device you use, your operating system, your internet provider, the pages you view, your referring and exit pages, the date and time of your visit, the number of clicks to, from, and within our websites, and the duration of your visit (“Usage Data”). We commit to maintaining and using this de-identified Usage Data without attempting to re-identify any such Usage Data. Because Usage Data is not reasonably capable of being individually associated with you, it is therefore not Personal Information. Remember, however, that:

    3. Sensitive Personal Information: We do not collect information that would be considered sensitive under any state’s laws, such as information relating to a known child, precise geolocation data, data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual orientation, or citizenship or immigration status.

    **Information We Collect**
    
    When you visit the Sites, our web server will temporarily record certain information from the device you use to access our Sites, the domain name or IP address of the requesting computer, the access date, the file request of the client (file name and URL), the HTTP response code and the Site from which you are visiting us, the number of bytes transferred during the connection and, if applicable, other technical information that we use and statistically evaluate for the technical implementation of the website’s use (such as delivery of the content, guaranteeing the website’s functionality and security, etc.).
    
    It is necessary to store and process the information referred to above for the duration of your session in order to deliver our Site content to your device. We also store some of this information in the log files of our servers. We will not combine this information with your IP address or other personal information relating to you except as disclosed below.
    
    We will also use the data described above to draw conclusions about your interests from your use and to adapt our Site’s offerings according to your interests (profiling) in order to make our website as user-friendly, safe and attractive as possible and thus promote the sale of Services.
    
    **What is a Cookie?**
    
    A browser cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your device to help websites and mobile apps remember things about you. Other technologies, including web beacons, web storage, and identifiers associated with your device, may be used for similar purposes. In this Policy, we say “cookies” to refer to all of these technologies. Cookies allow a website to recognize a user’s device. Cookies allow you to navigate between pages efficiently, remember preferences and generally improve the user experience for you. They can also be used to tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across websites.
    
    Cookies are one of two variants. Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser and persistent cookies remain on your device after the browser is closed (for example to remember your user preferences when you return to the website). Persistent cookies, also known as permanent cookies, are cookies that are stored on your hard drive until they expire or until you delete the cookie.
    
    We use the following types of cookies:
    
    * Essential Cookies are required to make our Site function properly and cannot be turned off in our systems. If you block these cookies, portions of our Site may not function properly.
    * Performance and Functional Cookies allow us to count visits and sources of traffic on our Website so we can measure and improve performance and functionality. They help us know which pages of our Site are most and least popular and how visitors move around the Site.
    * Targeted Advertising Cookies may be set through our Sites by our advertising partners. They may be used by advertising companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other websites.
    * Social Media Cookies allow you to share information using social media sharing buttons on social networks like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, or Twitter. This information may then be used by the social media network to deliver targeted advertising to you.
    
    We may combine information collected automatically (as described above) from your interactions with our website and your activity on third-party sites with other data (including personal information).
    
    **Managing Cookies**
    
    If you wish to opt out of allowing certain cookies, you may do so by changing your browser settings so that cookies from our Site cannot be set. Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your cookie management choices.
    
    Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies and to delete cookies. The methods for doing so vary from browser to browser, and from version to version. You can however obtain up-to-date information about blocking and deleting cookies via these links:
