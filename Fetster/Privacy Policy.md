Do Not Track
------------

Fetster does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, Safari, Chrome, firefox and other browsers allows you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
