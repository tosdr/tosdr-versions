#### Editorial Policy

Before you upload … our editorial guidelines

What can you upload?  
You can upload any documents you’ve created, such as study notes, revision sheets, summaries, formula sheets, sample answers, sample practice tests, sample questions and more!  
The important thing is that you’ve created the material yourself, and not copied someone else’s work (including something from a book, something your lecturer or teacher has given you or something from a commercial study guide).  
Also, don’t upload lecture notes if they’re more than a summary of what was covered in the lecture.  
Don’t do any of these!  
Avoid plagiarism \[http://www.plagiarism.org\] and copyright infringement \[http://www.copyright.org.au\]!  
Don’t:  
• upload someone else’s work …  
• copy chunks of websites, books, encyclopaedias and so on into your work …  
• use more of a quote than you need to make your point …  
• include someone else’s material that you don’t discuss …  
• upload lecture notes that are more than summaries of what was covered …  
• upload essays that don’t have proper citations (such as bibliographies and footnotes) …  
Also, don’t upload anything that:  
• is abusive …  
• is racist or sexist …  
• includes logos or trademarks (including the logo of the college, uni or school you attend) …  
• is really just advertising …  
• contains any personal details (your’s or anyone else’s) …  
Citations and references  
If you’ve used any reference material to write an essay: you must list these in your bibliography.  
If you’ve included any quotes or any illustrations (including any graphs or tables): you must properly cite these.  
There are different ways of citing – any of these are fine for essays you want to upload. (For information on citation and referencing methods, see your teacher or lecturer, or see HERE http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation  
You can only upload if your document is in Word or PDF format AND the file size is less than 50MB.  
For PDFs:  
We prefer documents that are typed, but scans of something that’s handwritten is OK if:  
• it’s a good quality scan; and  
• your handwriting’s easy to read.  
For Word documents:  
• check that the paper size is set at A4.  
FAQs  
Can I upload the question with an answer or essay I wrote? This will usually be fine, but don’t upload a whole set of questions someone else created.  
What do I do if I want to upload my answers to all or most of a set of questions written by someone else (including from a book or study guide)? In these cases, provide a reference to the book or other source where people can find the questions themselves and the page number. You should also number your answers (for example, Q1, Q2 and so on) so people can match your answer to the relevant question.  
Can I refer to the fact that the document I’m uploading relates to a particular course or, for example, to the HSC, VCE or IELTS? This will usually be fine, but don’t imply that your document is in any way “official” (for example, that it’s a recommended model answer). So, for example, you can say that your notes relate to a particular course at XYZ University, but make sure any scan doesn’t include XYZ University’s crest or logo.  
What will happen if I don’t stick to these guidelines? We may take your material down – in which case, everyone loses. You may also be legally liable if, for example, you’ve infringed copyright.

Checklist  
• All your own work?  
• Only quoted what you need to make your point?  
• Properly cited all your sources?  
• All quotes and illustrations (including tables and graphs) are properly cited?  
• File’s in PDF or Word?  
• File size less than 50MB?  
• It’s legible?
