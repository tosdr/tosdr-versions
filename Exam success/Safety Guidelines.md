### Exam Success child safe policy

#### Our commitment to child safety

Original dated 12th Day of December 2016. Updated 18 February 2020.  
Our organisation is committed to child safety.  
We want children to be safe, happy and empowered. We support and respect all children, as well as our contractors.  
We are committed to the safety, participation and empowerment of all children.  
We have zero tolerance of child abuse, and all allegations and safety concerns will be treated very seriously and consistently with our robust policies and procedures.  
We have legal and moral obligations to contact authorities when we are worried about a child’s safety, which we follow rigorously.  
Our organisation is committed to preventing child abuse and identifying risks early, and removing and reducing these risks.  
Our organisation has solid human resources and recruitment practices all contractors.  
Our organisation is committed to regularly educating our contractors and staff on child abuse risks.  
We support and respect all children, as well as our contractors and staff. We are committed to the cultural safety of Aboriginal children, the cultural safety of children from a culturally and/or linguistically diverse backgrounds, and to providing a safe environment for children with a disability.  
We have specific policies, procedures and training in place that support our leadership team, contractors and staff to achieve these commitments.  
If you believe a child is at immediate risk of abuse phone 000.

#### Our children

This policy is intended to empower children who are vital and active participants in our organisation. We involve them when making decisions, especially about matters that directly affect them. We listen to their views and respect what they have to say.  
We promote diversity and tolerance in our organisation, and people from all walks of life and cultural backgrounds are welcome. In particular we:  
• promote the cultural safety, participation and empowerment of Aboriginal children  
• promote the cultural safety, participation and empowerment of children from culturally and/or linguistically diverse backgrounds  
• ensure that children with a disability are safe and can participate equally.

#### Our contractors and staff

This policy guides our contractors and staff on how to behave with children in our organisation.  
All of our contractors and staff must agree to abide by our code of conduct which specifies the standards of conduct required when working with children. All contractors and staff, as well as children and their families, are given the opportunity to contribute to the development of the code of conduct.

#### Training and supervision

Training and education is important to ensure that everyone in our organisation understands that child safety is everyone’s responsibility.  
Our organisational culture aims for all contractors and staff (in addition to parents/carers and children) to feel confident and comfortable in discussing any allegations of child abuse or child safety concerns.  
We also support our contractors and staff through ongoing supervision to: develop their skills to protect children from abuse; and promote the cultural safety of Aboriginal children, the cultural safety of children from linguistically and/or diverse backgrounds, and the safety of children with a disability.  
New contractors will be provided with the policy and a code to conduct to ensure they understand our organisation’s commitment to child safety and that everyone has a role to play in protecting children from abuse, as well as checking that their behaviour towards children is safe and appropriate (please refer to this organisation’s code of conduct to understand appropriate behaviour further). Any inappropriate behaviour will be reported through appropriate channels, including the Department of Health and Human Services and Victoria Police, depending on the severity and urgency of the matter.

#### Recruitment

We take all reasonable steps to employ skilled people to work with children. We develop selection criteria and advertisements which clearly demonstrate our commitment to child safety and an awareness of our social and legislative responsibilities. Our organisation understands that when recruiting contractors and staff we have ethical as well as legislative obligations.  
All people engaged in child-related work, including volunteers, are required to hold a Working with Children Check and to provide evidence of this Check. Please see the Working with Children Check website for further information  
We carry out checks deemed necessary to ensure that we are recruiting the right people. If a police record check is required, it is used only for the purposes of recruitment and is discarded after the recruitment process is complete. We do retain our own records (but not the actual criminal record) if an applicant’s criminal history affected our decision making process.  
If during the recruitment process a person’s records indicate a criminal history then the person will be given the opportunity to provide further information and context.

#### Fair procedures for personnel

The safety and wellbeing of children is our primary concern. We are also fair and just to personnel. The decisions we make when recruiting, assessing incidents, and undertaking disciplinary action will always be thorough, transparent, and based on evidence.  
We record all allegations of abuse and safety concerns using our incident reporting form, including investigation updates. All records are securely stored.  
If an allegation of abuse or a safety concern is raised, we provide updates to children and families on progress and any actions we as an organisation take.

#### Privacy

All personal information considered or recorded will respect the privacy of the individuals involved, whether they be staff, volunteers, parents or children, unless there is a risk to someone’s safety. We have safeguards and practices in place to ensure any personal information is protected. Everyone is entitled to know how this information is recorded, what will be done with it, and who will have access to it.

#### Legislative responsibilities

Our organisation takes our legal responsibilities seriously, including:  
• Failure to disclose: Reporting child sexual abuse is a community-wide responsibility. All adults in Victoria who have a reasonable belief that an adult has committed a sexual offence against a child under 16 have an obligation to report that information to the police.  
• Failure to protect: People of authority in our organisation will commit an offence if they know of a substantial risk of child sexual abuse and have the power or responsibility to reduce or remove the risk, but negligently fail to do so.  
• Any personnel who are mandatory reporters must comply with their duties.

#### Risk management

In Victoria, organisations are required to protect children when a risk is identified (see information about failure to protect above). In addition to general occupational health and safety risks, we proactively manage risks of abuse to our children.  
We have risk management strategies in place to identify, assess, and take steps to minimise child abuse risks, which include risks posed by physical environments (for example, any doors that can lock), and online environments (for example, no contractor or staff is to have contact with a child in organisations on social media).

#### Regular review

This policy will be reviewed every two years and following significant incidents if they occur. We will ensure that families and children have the opportunity to contribute. Where possible we do our best to work with local Aboriginal communities, culturally and/or linguistically diverse communities and people with a disability.

#### Allegations, concerns and complaints

Our organisation takes all allegations seriously and has practices in place to investigate thoroughly and quickly. Our contractors and staff are trained to deal appropriately with allegations.  
We work to ensure all children, families, contractors and staff know what to do and who to tell if they observe abuse or are a victim, and if they notice inappropriate behaviour.  
We all have a responsibility to report an allegation of abuse if we have a reasonable belief that an incident took place (see information about failure to disclose above).  
If an adult has a reasonable belief that an incident has occurred then they must report the incident. Factors contributing to reasonable belief may be:  
• a child states they or someone they know has been abused (noting that sometimes the child may in fact be referring to themselves)  
• behaviour consistent with that of an abuse victim is observed  
• someone else has raised a suspicion of abuse but is unwilling to report it  
• observing suspicious behaviour.
