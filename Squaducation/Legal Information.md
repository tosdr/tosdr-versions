\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all information that we record about you. It sets out the conditions under which we may process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information.
    
2. We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our website immediately.
    
3. We take seriously the protection of your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website are entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party.
    
4. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.
    
5. Our privacy notice complies with UK law accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    
6. The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regard to the processing and control of your personal data.
    
7. More information about how we keep your data safe can be found in our Data Protection Policy
    
8. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.  
      
      
     
    

**The basis on which we process information about you**  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.

Squaducation Ltd has established the following lawful basis to process data:

1. **Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you**
    

When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.

In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us. Some of this information may be personal information.

We may use it in order to:

1. verify your identity for security purposes
    
2. sell products to you
    
3. provide you with our services
    
4. provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website
    

We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.

Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.

We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.

1. **Information we process with your consent**
    

Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website, watch our free films, or ask us to provide you more information about our business, including free film updates, our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.

You will be asked to positively OPT IN to receiving this information and advised of our privacy notice wherever possible.

Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.

Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor the performance of a particular page on our website.

We will continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us [hello@squaducation.com](mailto:hello@squaducation.com).  However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.
