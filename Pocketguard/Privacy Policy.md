==============

##### Last updated: September 6, 2023

Welcome to PocketGuard, Inc. (collectively, “PocketGuard”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive through our website located at [https://pocketguard.com/](https://pocketguard.com/) (the “Website”) and our services accessible via our downloadable applications (“App”) (together, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use, and share information that identifies, relates to, or could be reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular identified or identifiable natural person or household (“Personal Information”).

By using or submitting information through the Services, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our [Terms of Use](https://pocketguard.com/terms/).

##### Revisions to this Privacy Policy

Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services, and we’ll update the “Last Updated” date above to indicate when those changes will become effective.

##### Information Collected or Received from You

When you use the Services, we may collect Personal Information and other information from you as further described below.

PocketGuard Account Information

If you create a PocketGuard Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address, and phone number, which is Personal Information. If you choose to utilize your Apple, Google, or LinkedIn account for authentication during the registration process, please be aware that we may also collect your account ID on the respective platform for verification purposes.

Bank Account Information

If you want to link a bank account that you hold with a financial institution (“Bank Account”) to your PocketGuard Account, we will collect certain information from you about your Bank Account, such as your online login credentials, for the purposes of providing the Services to you. If you give us access to your Bank Account, you acknowledge and agree that we will have access to your transaction information, amount of funds, and other information about you and your Bank Account that may be available through the online settings for your Bank Account or otherwise through the relevant financial institution (“Financial Information”) that we require in order to provide the Services to you. You also may upload bank statements in .csv format in order to access your Bank Account’s transaction history. Another feature you can use in your account is to attach a picture of a bill or any other image to your transaction. By doing so, you consent to the storage and processing of uploaded information and images by PocketGuard.

Verification Information

For compliance purposes and in order to provide the Services to you, we may obtain from you or from third-party documentation that helps us to verify your identity and Bank Account details. For example, we may ask you to provide a copy of your government-issued photo ID, a copy of a utility bill or bank statement, or such other documentation that contains Personal Information. We may also obtain information about you from the financial institution providing your Bank Account.

Third-Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons

We may also implement third-party content, or advertising on the Service that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third-party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third-party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow such third party to collect information about you through such third party’s browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by the third party, and PocketGuard does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.

Information from Other Sources

We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners or advertisers. We may also, at your direction, receive information from third-party services that provide a mechanism to expose information you have provided to such third parties through the use of an application program interface (API), such as Google API, Facebook API, or Apple API. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Information Related to the Use of the Services

Our servers automatically record certain information about how our users (each, a “User”) use our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences.

We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services. For example, we may collect a device identifier, user settings, and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.

Location Information

When you use our App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.

##### How We Use Information

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide you with a secure, smooth, and customized experience, to administer your use of the Services, to fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.

This Personal Information and Financial Information will be used by your Advisor, in conjunction with our Services, to analyze information and provide customized financial services to you. Your Advisor’s use of your information is governed by their privacy policy or other applicable document provided by your Advisor to you which regulates the usage of your Personal Information and Financial Information.

If you choose to pursue any of the offers that the Services present to you, you will be asked if you would like the Services to pass on your Personal Information and relevant Financial Information to the third-party marketing partner as a convenience. For example, if the Services generate an offer from a third-party loan provider for you, the Services will give you the option of moving forward with that offer within the App, and if you agree to do so, the Services will pass your Personal Information and relevant Financial Information to that third party loan provider to speed up the process of your application.
