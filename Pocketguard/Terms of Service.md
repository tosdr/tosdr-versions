##### The Service.

The Service is available online through the Website (and also through our software mobile application).

PocketGuard’s paid Service PocketGuard Plus includes access to the feature Cancel Unwanted Subscriptions, which provides you the information on how you can cancel your subscriptions with third-party providers by yourself. You understand and agree that we may offer you recommendations for canceling subscriptions based on the User Accounts data. Cancel Unwanted Subscriptions does not include our participation in the unsubscribe process, or interaction with third-party providers on your behalf, we do not act as your agent or another authorized representative.

**PocketGuard enables your financial advisors (referred to as the “Advisor”) to access your data by creating an account and sending you an invitation link designated by PocketGuard. By accepting the invitation link and registering the account, you grant permission to the Advisor to read, view, analyze, and edit your personal financial information and User Accounts data within your PocketGuard account.

As long as the advisor-client relationship is active, the client’s PocketGuard account will remain on premium status. If the connection between the client and the advisor is broken, the client’s account will revert to the basic status, except if the client was already on a subscription to PocketGuard Plus before the advisor invited them.**

The Services are designed to allow you to access Provider Services (if and to the extent provided by your provider(s)) to set up banking and other information, schedule the Services to access your account(s), download transactions into the Services and otherwise aggregate information from your account(s) with your provider(s). You acknowledge and agree that we have no control over the provision of Provider Services or provision of access to the Provider Services by your provider(s), do not guarantee that you will be able to use the Services with the Provider Services, and will have no liability whatsoever for any actions or inactions on the part of the provider(s) resulting in your inability to use the Services to access your accounts, obtain data, download transactions, or otherwise use or access the Provider Services.
    
    **2.2 Collection of Provider Account Information.** You acknowledge that in accessing your data and information through the Services, your provider account access number(s), password(s), security question(s) and answer(s), account number(s), login information, and any other security or access information, and the actual data in your account(s) with such provider(s) such as bank and other account balances, credit card charges, debits and deposits (collectively, “Provider Account Data”), may be collected and stored in the Services. You authorize us and our third-party vendors, in conjunction with the operation and hosting of the Services, to use certain Provider Account Data to (a) collect your Provider Account Data, (b) reformat and manipulate such Provider Account Data, (c) create and provide hypertext links to your provider(s), (d) access the providers’ websites using your Provider Account Data, (e) update and maintain your account information, (f) address errors or service interruptions, (g) enhance the type of data and services we can provide to you in the future, and (h) take such other actions as are reasonably necessary to perform the actions described in (a) through (g) above.

If you see a discrepancy in the Provider Account Data, and in any case before making any transactions or decisions based on such account information presented in the Services, you should check the last refresh date for the account and confirm Provider Account Data is correct by following the link back to the applicable provider or otherwise confirm that Provider Account Data is up to date and accurate.
