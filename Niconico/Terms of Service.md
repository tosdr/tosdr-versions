Niconico Terms of Use
=====================

Niconico Terms of Use (these “Terms of Use”) apply to any use by users (simply, the “User(s)”) of “Niconico” and services related to “Niconico” (including services operated by a company other than the Operating Company; collectively, “Niconico”) which are provided by DWANGO Co., Ltd. (the “Operating Company”). The Users shall consent to these Terms of Use and “Basic Policy on Personal Information Protection” in using “niconico.”In addition, the Users shall respect and consent to the substance of the niconico Action Guidelines established by the Operating Company.

These Terms of Use provide basic matters that will commonly apply to all individual services of “Niconico” (the “Individual Services”), and in order to use the Individual Services, the Users must consent to the terms of use of each Individual Service (the “Individual Terms of Use”) in addition to these Terms of Use. If there is any discrepancy concerning any matter between the Individual Terms of Use and these Terms of Use, the Individual Terms of Use shall have precedence over these Terms of Use.

If the User is a minor, they shall have a person with parental authority (shinkensha) confirm these Terms of Use and “Individual Terms of Use” (These Terms of Use, etc. ), and use “Niconico” with the consent of the person with parental authority. Minor Users who used “Niconico” will be deemed to have used the same with the foregoing consent of the person with parental authority. However, where there any mandatory provisions limiting the use of “Niconico” by a person under 13-years of age in the country that the User resides in, the relevant person shall not be allowed to use “Niconico” irrespective of the foregoing.

1\. Registration of account information
---------------------------------------

The Users shall consent to these Terms of Use and register their account information (including all rights and interests in the registered information and account; hereinafter the same), and may use “Niconico” operated by the Operating Company using the registered account information. The Operating Company shall not be liable whatsoever if a User suffers any damage because the account information is inaccurate or false, and the Users shall consent to this.

The Operating Company may, at its discretion, add or otherwise change the Individual Services available with the account information that the Users registered, and the Users consent to this.

The Operating Company shall notify the Users of the information related to such changes on the window on which the services are provided, by which the Users shall learn of such information.

In addition, there may be instances where there are functions available by which the Users may, at their discretion, select whether or not they will use the registered account information when using each Individual Service.

The reason why the registered account information is necessary and the substance of the services provided using the registered account information shall be explained on the window on which the services are provided on the website of each Individual Service, by which the Users shall learn of such information.

The Users shall not assign, lend or allow use of their account information to or by a third party for any purpose.

2\. Management of accounts
--------------------------

The Users shall manage their account information at their responsibility and authority, and where “Niconico” is used with the registered account information, the Operating Company will deem that the User who registered the relevant account information used “Niconico”. Even where a User suffered any damage from an unauthorized use of the account information by a third party, the User who registered the relevant account information shall be entirely liable.

The Operating Company may send emails regarding “Niconico” containing information about new functions, updated information and special offers to the email addresses that the Users registered (the message may be large, as necessary), and the Users shall consent to this. Information on the incoming messages setting shall be explained in each service and in the emails to be sent. Except where downloading is explicitly permitted, Users may not download any movie data from any video uploading website available to view on “Niconico” using their own account information via, among other things, software (including those which are recorded in a recording media and provided via communication line and add-in browsers), or websites provided by a third party who is not designated by the Operating Company, and the Users consent to this.
