    2. Instructure shall, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify Customer if it receives a request from a Data Subject for access to, correction, amendment, deletion of or objection to the processing of that person’s Personal Data. Instructure shall not respond to any such Data Subject request without Customer’s prior written consent except to confirm that the request relates to Customer or as otherwise required by Data Protection Laws. Instructure shall provide Customer with commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance in relation to the handling of a Data Subject’s request, to the extent legally permitted and to the extent Customer does not have access to such Customer Personal Data through its use or receipt of the Services, taking into account the nature of the Processing of Customer Personal Data and the information available to Instructure.
4. **PROCESSOR PERSONNEL.**
    1. Instructure shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its personnel engaged in the Processing of Customer Personal Data are subject to obligations of confidentiality.

        1. Instructure shall ensure that obligations not materially less protective than those set out in this DPA are imposed on Sub-processors by way of a written contract;
        2. Instructure remains liable towards Customer for the work of its Sub-processors as if and to the extent such work was performed by Instructure;
        3. Instructure shall provide the list of its Sub-processors by giving a link to a website where the information about the Sub-processors is kept up to date; and
        4. Instructure shall inform Customer of any intended changes to Sub-processors concerning the addition or replacement of Sub-processors.  To the extent required by Data Protection Laws, Instructure shall thereby give Customer the opportunity to object to such changes by notifying Instructure in writing within 30 days after the receipt of Instructure’s notice about the changes, and if, within 20 days of receipt of that notice, Customer notifies Instructure in writing of any objections on reasonable grounds to the proposed engagement of a Sub-processor, Instructure shall not use that proposed Sub-processor to Process Customer Personal Data until reasonable steps have been taken to address the objections raised by Customer and Customer has been provided with a reasonable written explanation of the steps taken.
6. **INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**
