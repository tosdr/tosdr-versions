Website traffic statistics with Matomo
--------------------------------------

We use the open source software Matomo on our websites to collect traffic statistics. Matomo is hosted on our own web servers. Matomo does not transfer any data to servers beyond our control.

In order to improve data protection, we let Matomo shorten the IP addresses of visitors to our websites.

Matomo does not process any of your data without your consent. With your consent, Matomo stores the following statistics cookies on your computer, which allow us to analyze your use of our websites:

**Name:** \_pk\_id...  
**Provider:** SoftMaker  
**Purpose:** Used to associate multiple visits to our websites from the same device with a single record.  
**Duration:** 13 months

**Name:** \_pk\_ses...  
**Provider:** SoftMaker  
**Purpose:** Cookie for the short-term storage of data.  
**Duration:** 30 minutes

Each time a data subject visits one of our website pages that uses Matomo, the browser is prompted to transmit data to our servers for analysis purposes.

If you agree to the collection of traffic statistics by Matomo, the information generated by the cookies about your use of the website, such as

* the IP address and/or host name of your computer,
* the name, language and version of your browser,

**Duration:** 2 years

This prevents the future collection of your data when you visit our websites. The cookie is only valid in this browser for one of our websites at a time, and it is stored on your computer.

The personal data provided by you or collected by us on our websites will not be used for automated decision-making.

Categories of recipients
------------------------

We commission various service providers to support us in the development of our software and customer service and in the provision of technical infrastructure. These service providers include, for example, software developers, external support employees and hosting providers. If such service providers act on our behalf, they may gain access to your personal data as recipients. In order to be able to respond quickly to customer service requests and crash reports, we also commission software developers and customer service providers in unsafe third countries for which there are no adequacy decisions of the EU Commission. However, all our service providers are also contractually obliged to comply with data protection via a data processing agreement or, in the case of unsafe third countries, via the EU's Standard Contractual Clauses. A copy of the EU's Standard Contractual Clauses can be found **[here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?uri=CELEX:32021D0914)**.

Transfer of data to third parties

Within the framework of the legal provisions, you have the option at all times of withdrawing your consent to the future processing of your personal data. To do so, please contact us via the e-mail address mentioned under "Contact details for inquiries regarding our privacy policy".

We would like to point out that the processing of your personal data, which we have carried out on the basis of your given consent until you withdraw it, shall not be affected by the withdrawal and shall remain lawful.

According to the latter Article, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of your personal data which is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (data processing on the basis of a weighing of interests). This also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Article 4(4) GDPR; however, we do not conduct profiling with your data. If you object, we will no longer process your data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend any legal claims.

Within the framework of the legal provisions, you have the right to submit complaints regarding data protection to a supervisory authority. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision, which you can reach via www.lda.bayern.de, is responsible for us. However, you can also contact any other supervisory authority.
