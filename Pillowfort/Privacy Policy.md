We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

* Comply with a legal obligation.
* Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

_Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights_: To exercise these access, data portability, and deletion rights under the CCPA, please submit a verifiable request to us by sending a message to info@pillowfort.social. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable request on behalf of your minor child.

* Provide enough information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
