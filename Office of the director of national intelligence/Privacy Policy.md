### Use of Cookies

This website does not use persistent cookies. It does, however, use non-persistent or "session" cookies to make it easier for you to use the features on our web pages. Session cookies last only as long as your web browser remains open and are deleted from our servers as soon as you leave our website. The ODNI and other government agencies do not collect or maintain any information from your session cookies.

### Your Personal Information

Any personal information you provide in the context of an inquiry or request for information will be used only to respond to your inquiry or request. We will not share your personal information with another government agency unless you have expressly requested we do so, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, the ODNI will not create individual profiles from your information or provide your information to any private organization for commercial purposes.

If you engage in a specialized business process through another government-sponsored website (e.g., to submit a resume; to provide online comments) you will be informed of additional privacy procedures at the point of entry for that process.

### Website Security

For site security purposes, and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system monitors network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, to defeat or circumvent a security feature, to interfere with system access or availability, or to cause damage or utilize this system for other than its intended purposes. **Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials.**

Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, to defeat or circumvent a security feature, to interfere with system access or availability, or to cause damage or utilize this system for other than its intended purposes, are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including but not limited to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. 1030) and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.
