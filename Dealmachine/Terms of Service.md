Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior

own defense of a Claim if it chooses to do so, but it must bear the costs of its own counsel and  
any activities in any disputed proceeding conducted by counsel of its choosing. The  
indemnifying Party may settle any Claim, to the extent it seeks a money payment, with or  
without the consent of the indemnified Party. The indemnifying Party must obtain the  
indemnified Party’s consent to any settlement to the extent it consents to injunctive relief or  
contains contract terms governing future activities that would materially affect the indemnified  
Party’s business or interests, said consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or  
delayed.

days after the date such Fees are due. Termination by either Party pursuant to this section shall  
not relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees accrued or payable to Provider prior to the effective date of termination. Upon any early termination by Customer pursuant to this  
paragraph, Provider shall have no obligation to refund Customer any prepaid Fees covering the  
remainder of the Term.

  
c. Termination With Cause. A Party may terminate this Agreement for cause: (i)  
upon thirty (30) days’ written notice of a material breach to the other Party if such breach  
remains uncured at the expiration of such period; (ii) immediately if the other Party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors and is not dismissed within sixty (60) days; or (iii) in the case of termination by Provider, Customer has violated applicable legal requirements or industry best practices, as determined by Provider in its sole discretion. Upon any termination for cause by Customer, Provider shall refund Customer any prepaid Fees  
covering the remainder of the Term. Termination for cause by Customer shall not relieve  
Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees accrued or payable to Provider prior to the effective  
date of termination. Upon any termination for cause by Provider, Customer shall remain  
obligated to pay all Fees owed for the remainder of the Term, all of which Fees shall become  
immediately due and payable in full, and if Customer prepaid Fees, such Fees will not be  
refunded.

  
d. Customer Data. Following the expiration or termination of this Agreement,  
Provider shall (i) convert Customer’s account to an inactive status or delete such account, and (ii) have no obligation to save Customer Data.

  
e. Survival. The provisions of Section 1 and Sections 3 through 11 of this  
Agreement shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

  
11\. General Provisions.

  
a. Relationship of the Parties. This Agreement does not create a partnership,  
franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the Parties. The  
relationship between the Parties under this Agreement is solely that of independent contracting parties.

  
b. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this  
Agreement.

  
c. Notices. All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall  
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given upon: (i) personal delivery to the Party to  
be notified; (ii) the second (2nd) business day after mailing, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested; (iii) the second (2nd) business day after sending by confirmed facsimile; or (iv) on the same business day if sent by email. Notices to Provider shall be addressed as follows: DealMachine L.L.C. Attn: David Lecko, 735 Shelby Street, Suite 100,  
Indianapolis, Indiana 46203, david@dealmachine.com. Notices to Customer shall be addressed  
to Customer’s address and contact information in the relevant Order Form or as otherwise  
provided by Customer.

  
d. No Legal, Financial, or Tax Advice. No financial, legal, or tax advice or counsel is given, or shall be deemed to have been given by Provider or by the Services.

  
e. Waiver and Cumulative Remedies. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of that right. Other than as expressly stated herein, the remedies provided herein are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other remedies of a Party at law or in equity.

  
f. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited and unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such  
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provisions in any other jurisdiction.

  
g. Assignment. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder,  
whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other Party  
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, without consent of the other party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets not involving a direct competitor of the other Party. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this Section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  
h. GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTES; BINDING ARBITRATION; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. This Agreement shall be governed exclusively by the internal laws of the State of Indiana, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules. Customer and Provider agree to make a good-faith effort to resolve any disagreement arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement through negotiation. If any negotiation required by this section fails, then at the written request of either Party, any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any breach hereof shall be finally settled by arbitration by a single arbitrator, without option to appeal, in Indianapolis, Indiana, applying relevant Indiana state law, pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Rules”) then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration costs will be borne by each Party as required by the Rules. Customer’s pursuit of claims to arbitration, as required by this Agreement, is limited to Customer’s own claims. Customer waives any right to assert any claims against Provider as a representative or  
member in any class or representative action, except where such waiver is prohibited by  
applicable law. The award made in such arbitration shall be entered in any court having  
jurisdiction thereof solely for the purpose of applying for an order confirming, modifying,  
correcting or vacating the award. The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, revoke or suspend any of the provisions of this Agreement. Except to the extent required by law, no party, arbitrator, representative, counsel or witness shall disclose or confirm to any person not present at the arbitration hearings any information about the hearings, including the names of the parties and arbitrators, the nature and amount of the claims, the financial condition of any party, the expected date of hearing or the award made. At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator shall award reasonable fees and costs to the prevailing party in such arbitration, to the extent authorized by applicable law. Customer understands that it would have had an opportunity to litigate any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement through a court, to have a judge or jury decide its case, and to participate in a class or representative action, but has instead chosen to have any controversy, dispute or claim resolved through individual arbitration. Any dispute regarding the enforceability or scope of this arbitration provision will be heard in the state or federal courts of Indianapolis, Indiana, and each party consents to the jurisdiction thereof.

  
i. Force Majeure. Except for obligations of Customer for the payment of Fees or other sums hereunder, if either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by force majeure to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, that party shall give to the other party prompt notice of the force majeure with reasonable specificity. Thereupon the obligations of the Party giving notice, so far as they are affected by the force majeure, shall be suspended during, but no longer than, the continuance of the force majeure. The affected Party shall use all reasonable diligence to remove the force majeure as quickly as possible. The term “force majeure” shall without limitation mean an act of God, strike, industrial disturbance, act of the public enemy, war, blockage, public riot, lightning, fire, storm, flood, epidemic/pandemic, failure of utilities,  
failure of internet collocation facilities or other Internet failure, any unauthorized server or  
computer violation or other security violation, explosion, governmental restraint, or any other  
cause, whether of the kind specifically enumerated above or otherwise, which is not reasonably  
within the control of the Party claiming suspension.

  
j. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all Order Forms, constitutes the  
entire agreement between the Parties, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Party against whom the modification, amendment, or waiver is to be asserted. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail unless expressly stated otherwise in the applicable Order Form. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be language chosen by both Parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction against either Party shall apply to rights granted herein or to any term of condition of this Agreement.

  
k. Precedence. To the extent that the Parties have entered into any other written agreements for the provision of services that are beyond the scope of the Services provided pursuant to this Agreement, and to the extent that such agreements conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control as to the contents hereof and the subject  
matter contained herein with respect to the provision of the Services, unless expressly provided to the contrary in such other agreements.  
  
l. Acceptance. Customer accepts and agrees to be bound and abide by the terms of this Agreement in any of the following manners: Customer (i) clicking a box indicating Customer’s acceptance of this Agreement; (ii) performing some other form of assent hereto; or (iii) executing or otherwise agreeing to an Order Form that references this Agreement and of  
which this Agreement is a part. Such acceptance shall apply to Permitted Users.

  
m. Changes to Agreement. Provider reserves the right to modify the terms and  
conditions of this Agreement, and such modifications shall be binding on Customer immediately upon posting of the updated Agreement to the Services. Customer should check for updates frequently. Provider reserves the right to modify any information on pages referenced in the hyperlink(s) from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Services after any such changes shall constitute Customer’s consent to such changes. Unless material changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, Customer agrees that modification of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration (if applicable).
