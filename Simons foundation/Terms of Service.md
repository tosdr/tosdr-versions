Please read the Terms carefully before you start to use the Site. **By using the** **Site, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, found at [https://www.simonsfoundation.org/privacy-policy-online-publications/](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/privacy-policy-online-publications/), incorporated herein by reference**. If you do not want to agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Site.

**Future Changes To These Terms**

These Terms may change at any time in our sole discretion, and you should review them regularly.  Amendments to these Terms will become effective immediately when posted to the Site unless otherwise specified and apply to all access to and use of the Site thereafter.  Your use of the Site after the effective date of any updated Terms posted on the Site constitutes your consent to the updated Terms.

**Accessing the Site**

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend this Site, and any service or material we provide on the Site, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason if any part of the Site is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Site, or the entire Site, to users, including registered users.

**Copyright** 

All content included on this Site, such as text, graphics, logos, button icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, videos, data compilations, and software, is owned by us or our content suppliers and protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws (“IP Laws”). The compilation of all content on this Site is our exclusive property unless otherwise noted and is protected by United States and international IP Laws. All software used on this Site is owned by us or our software suppliers and is protected by United States and international IP Laws.

These Terms permit you to use the Site for your personal, non-commercial use only. You must not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, download, store, or transmit any of the material on our Site, other than as permitted by law.

You must not access or use for any commercial purposes any part of the Site or any services or materials available through the Site. If you print, copy, modify, download, or otherwise use or provide any other person with access to any part of the Site in breach of the Terms, your right to use the Site will stop immediately and you must, at our option, return or destroy any copies of the materials you have made. No right, title, or interest in or to the Site or any content on the Site is transferred to you, and all rights not expressly granted are reserved by Simons Foundation. Any use of the Site not expressly permitted by these Terms is a breach of these Terms and may violate United States and international IP Laws.

**Trademark**

The trademarks, logos, and service marks (“Marks”) displayed on the Site are our registered trademarks or registered trademarks of our affiliates, licensors or third-party content providers (“collectively, the “Mark Holders”), are our property or the property of Mark Holders, and are protected by United States and international IP Laws. Their uses are restricted to this Site and those publication, programs and events sponsored by us, and our Marks may not be used for personal financial gain.

Use of the Marks is prohibited without our express written consent, except as permitted by applicable laws. Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use the Marks without our express written consent.

Any Content you post to the Site will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. By submitting Content, you grant to us, subject to our Privacy Policy, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right to store, host, reproduce, create derivate works of, publish, publicly perform, display, use and distribute such Content. You also grant us the right to sub-license these rights and the right to sue for infringement of these rights. All these intellectual property rights are reserved. (This license only applies to Content you publicly post to the Site — it does not apply to any personally identifiable information you supply when you, for example, create an account, or sign up for an event, which is used and protected in accordance with our Privacy Policy.)

You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any Content you submit or contribute, and you have full responsibility for such Content, including its legality, reliability, accuracy, and appropriateness. We are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any Content posted by you or any other user of the Site.

**Discussion Policy For Content Posted For Users**

Our digital community channels provide a place where ideas and content can be shared, and conversation can flow freely and respectfully. We encourage you to join the conversation. Below are our guidelines for communicating on these channels.

In general, we do not control, pre-approve, or monitor content submitted by our community members. Nevertheless, we nonetheless retain the right (but not the obligation) to monitor, refuse to post, or delete any Content available through the Site.

Posts or discussions by community members in no way reflect our views.

By posting any Content, you are agreeing that you will follow these guidelines, as well as the rest of these Terms, and that we may use your Content to promote our work and as described further herein.

We may remove or block Content and/or block users from our pages if we consider Content to be in any way inconsistent with or harmful to the purpose of the community, including:

* Content that is profane, obscene, vulgar, defamatory, abusive, threatening, false, misleading, offensive, derogatory or discriminatory (including comments about sex, age, race, sexual orientation, political or religious affiliation), or otherwise inappropriate;
* Spam;
* Use of names or photographs of individuals without their permission or Content that otherwise invades confidentiality or privacy interests;
* Promotion of any advertisement for products, services, or causes, or solicitation of funds;
* Any Content that is an invasion of privacy, a breach of any data protection principle or legislation, a malicious falsehood or seditious libel, a contempt of court, or that is likely to incite or is capable of inciting violence, racial hatred, sadism or cruelty or that encourages any unlawful or illegal act or omission;
* Impersonating anyone else, whether a public figure, a member of our staff, a forum moderator, administrator or host, or another visitor of this Site;
* Content that infringes copyright or any other intellectual property rights; or
* Any other content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates the spirit or letter of these guidelines or any other provision in these Terms.

By posting Content, you further agree that:

* We bear no responsibility for its accuracy, appropriateness, or quality;
* You must evaluate and bear all risks associated with any Content you post, including the risks of any intellectual property or other legal claims related to the Content;
* We will be in no way liable for any Content or any consequences of its inclusion or omission and that there is no implication that any Content posted by users on the Site is in any way endorsed or approved by us; and

The owner of any website with a hyperlink to this Site agrees to the foregoing terms and agrees to delete any such link upon notice from us that such permission has been revoked, which notice may be given at any time and for any reason.
