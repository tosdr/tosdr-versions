The TOU, and any additional terms to which you agree when using particular elements of the Service, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Biasly and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreement between you and Biasly. The failure of Biasly to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

Violation of terms and liquidated damage
----------------------------------------

Please report any violations of the TOU by sending an email to info@Biasly.com .

Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if it becomes necessary for Biasly to pursue legal action to enforce the TOU, you will be liable to pay Biasly the following amounts as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of Biasly’s damages for the specified breaches of the TOU:

If you post a message that (i) impersonates any person or entity; (ii) falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity; or (iii) that includes personal or identifying information about another person without that person’s explicit consent, you agree to pay Biasly one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such message. This provision does not apply to messages that are lawful non-deceptive parodies of public figures.

If Biasly establishes limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to pay Biasly one hundred dollars ($100) for each message posted in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access Biasly in excess of such limits, whichever is higher.

If you send unsolicited email advertisements to Biasly email addresses or through Biasly computer systems, you agree to pay Biasly twenty five dollars ($25) for each such email.

If you post Content in violation of the TOU, other than as described above, you agree to pay Biasly one hundred dollars ($100) for each item of Content posted. In its sole discretion, Biasly may elect to issue a warning before assessing damages.

If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the TOU, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree to pay Biasly one hundred dollars ($100) for each and every item of Content posted in violation of the TOU. A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the “Principal”), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in violation of the TOU) agrees to pay Biasly an additional one hundred dollars ($100) for each item of Content posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of the principal in violation of the TOU.

If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of the TOU without Biasly’s express written permission, you agree to pay Biasly three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day on which you engage in such conduct.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the TOU, Biasly retains the right to seek the remedy of specific performance of any term contained in the TOU, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the TOU, or to seek to recover damages arising from or relating to a violation of this TOU or any combination thereof.
