Last updated: June 2018

This Cookie Statement explains how AAA Internet Publishing Inc. trading as WTFast (“WTFast”, “we“, “us“, and “ours“) use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our website [https://www.wtfast.com](https://www.wtfast.com/en) (the “Website“) or use our Gamers Private Network (or “GPN”) software service (the “WTFast Service”). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,WTFast) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

### Why do we use cookies?

We use first party WTFast cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website and WTFast Service to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website and WTFast Service. Third parties serve cookies through our Website and WTFast Service for advertising, analytics and other purposes.This is described in more detail below.

The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Website and WTFast Service and the purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Website or WTFast Service you visit):

### What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

### Do you serve targeted advertising?

Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information about your visits to our Websites and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.

### How can I control cookies?

If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted.
