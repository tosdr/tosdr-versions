================

* * *

**Terms and Conditions**

By using WTFast you agree to be bound by these terms, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. These terms take effect immediately on your first visit. If you do not agree to all of the following terms please do not access WTFast. If any of the terms or conditions are not met, your account is subject to closure.

**E-mail**

By creating a WTFast account and giving us your e-mail address, you agree to receive occasional marketing and/or business e-mails. You may opt out of receiving these e-mails at any time by choosing the unsubscribe option located in the e-mail you received. We will not sell or give your e-mail address to anyone else.

**Security**

To help ensure the safety of your game account, we recommend using a different e-mail and password combination for your WTFast account login details. We do not share any of your information with anyone else.

**Liability**

WTFast makes our best effort to ensure maximum uptime and stability of our servers. In no event shall WTFast, its suppliers or related software developers be liable for any damages including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, loss of a game account arising out of the use or inability to use the WTFast service, even if WTFast has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.

**Usage**

Use of WTFast servers are limited to gameplay only. You may not use them for any malicious activities, downloading files, as a proxy (e.g. web browsing, IRC). You are responsible for your WTFast account details and may not give out your account details to anyone. WTFast uses IDCertainty to collect non-personally identifiable details from your computer to register your computer for use with your WTFast account. Only one computer may be registered to each WTFast account, unless you purchase a paid multi-computer subscription. WTFast reserves the right in it’s sole discretion to terminate any users account and use of service for any reason.

**Free Usage**

WTFast may offer some services for free on a trial basis at their own discretion.

**General**

If any of these terms are determined to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by reason of the laws of any state or country in which these terms are intended to be effective, then to the extent and within the jurisdiction in which that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from these terms and the remaining terms shall survive and continue to be binding and enforceable. The failure or delay of WTFast to exercise or enforce any right in these terms does not waive WTFast’s right to enforce that right.

**External Links**

WTFast has not reviewed all of the sites linked from the WTFast.com website and is not responsible for the contents of any such site. There is a members forum which is moderated; however, inappropriate external links may be posted by members and exist until removed by a WTFast moderator. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by WTFast. Use of any such linked web site is at the user’s own risk.

**Copyright Infringement Notifications**

If you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on a WTFast website without authorization, you may submit a copyright infringement notification. These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf. If you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, please remember that you are initiating a legal process. Do not make false claims. Misuse of this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences. Please submit copyright infringement notifications to [business@WTFast.com](mailto:business@WTFast.com), including your contact information, a description of the work that you believe has been infringed, the URL of where the infringing material is located. You must agree to and include the following statement: “I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”, and the following statement: “The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.” Complete complaints require the physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a representative authorized to act on their behalf. To satisfy this requirement, you may type your full legal name to act as your signature at the bottom of your complaint.

**Terms and Conditions Modifications**

WTFast may revise these terms and conditions for the WTFast service at any time without notice.
