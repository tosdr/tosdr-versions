### About This Privacy Notice

This Privacy Notice describes the information and collection practices on the websites, mobile applications, products, and services (collectively “Services”) that link to this Privacy Notice. These Services are provided by the provider companies listed on [https://www.pdffiller.com/en/contracting-entities](https://www.pdffiller.com/en/contracting-entities) .

We may process your personal information under an agreement with a third party and act as a data processor. For example, if a business customer uploads a contract for signature we will process the information under instructions from the customer. In those cases, the terms of that agreement may also govern how your information is used. If you believe a third party has asked us to process your personal information on their behalf, please contact them first.

Notice of Right to Opt-out of Sale/Sharing. California, Nevada, and Virginia law require that we tell you if we sell personal information to a third party for monetary or (in California) other valuable consideration. We do not do this. We also do not sell personal information of minors under the age of 16 for monetary or other valuable consideration. We may share information with third parties in order to provide cross-contextual behavioral advertising. This sharing provides you with more tailored and personalized content and ads. In the Notice at Collection (above), we outlined which categories of information are shared for cross-contextual behavioral advertising. Some browsers also allow you to tell websites not to share your information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising. We will respond to these signals in a frictionless manner. If you configure this setting on your browser, certain features on our site may not work and you will receive less targeted advertising. To learn how to configure this setting, view  [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) . Additionally, the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising provides consumers with the ability to manage certain choices online  [here](https://optout.aboutads.info/?amp;lang=EN&lang=EN&c=2)  and provides a tool for managing mobile choices [here](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) . Selections are browser and device-specific.

How it works. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us via the  [Privacy Request Portal](https://arsl.at/DGvPK3AB). For security purposes and as required by law, if you make a request to exercise the rights referenced above, we will require you to provide certain information for identity verification purposes. If you have an account with us, we may verify you through the login of your account. If you do not have an account with us, we may require you to provide additional information from which we can confirm your identity. Where permitted by law you may authorize an agent to make a request to us on your behalf, and we will verify the identity of your agent or authorized legal representative by either seeking confirmation from you or documents that establish the agent’s authorization to act on your behalf.

Exceptions. In some cases, we may not be able to complete your request because an exception exists under applicable law. For example, we may need to keep some information to provide the Services.  

**Transfers to the U.S. and Third Countries**
