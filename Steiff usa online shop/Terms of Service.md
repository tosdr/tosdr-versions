Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

**14\. INDEMNIFICATION**

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company from and against all actual or alleged third party claims, damages, awards, judgments, losses, liabilities, obligations, penalties, interest, fees, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneysâ fees and expenses) and costs (including, without limitation, court costs, costs of settlement, and costs of or associated with pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and nature whatsoever arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Services, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, or suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract or otherwise (collectively, âClaimsâ), including, but not limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of or are related to (a) your use or misuse of the Services or User Content; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation of the rights of any third party, including another Registered User; (e) any breach or non-performance of any covenant or agreement made by you; (f) your User Content; or (g) any off-chain benefits (including the furnishing, or any failure to furnish, or any acts or omissions of or attributable to you or any third party in respect of the same). You agree to promptly notify the Company of any third-party Claims and cooperate with the Company in defending such Claims. You further agree that the Company shall have control of the defense or settlement of any third-party Claims. THIS INDEMNITY IS IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN LIEU OF, ANY OTHER INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY.

**15\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH THE COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

a. Choice of Law; Venue. You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Services, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of Rhode Island without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in the State of Rhode Island\[HJ5\] , and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue.

b. Statute of Limitations. Any claim under these Terms must be brought within one year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. The prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneysâ fees.

c. Binding Arbitration. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and the Company in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and the Company agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and can be subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms, the Companyâs Privacy Policy, or your use of the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms (each, a âDisputeâ). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS WILL APPLY TO YOU AND THE COMPANY UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT OUT PURSUANT TO BELOW. Whether to agree to arbitration is an important business decision. It is your decision to make, and you should not rely solely on the information provided in these Terms as it is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration. You should take further steps to conduct research and to consult with others, including an attorney, regarding the consequences of your decision, just as you would when making any other important business or life decision. Nothing in these Terms, including the paragraph directly above, will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) bring an action in a court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, California Labor Code Â§ 2698 et seq.; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim (collectively, âExcluded Disputesâ).

d. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN ACTIONS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OF 2004, California Labor Code Â§ 2698 et seq. WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION 14). Further, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

e. Federal Arbitration Act. You and the Company agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§ 1 et seq. (the âFAAâ), to the maximum extent not prohibited by applicable law.

f. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. You and the Company agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within 30 days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to the Company shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Steiff North America, Attn: Customer Service/Privacy 24 Albion Rd. Suite 220, Lincoln, RI 02865 USA. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Site account and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent electronically and will include (x) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and the Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or the Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section, file a claim in court.

g. Process. Except for Excluded Disputes, you and the Company agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or the Company within the applicable statute of limitations period, otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred. You and the Company agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in the State of Rhode Island, Providence County (âSeatâ), (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, âAAA Rulesâ) of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of Rhode Island and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of Rhode Island, Providence County, have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at the Seat, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorâs ruling on the merits.

h. Authority of Arbitrator. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable AAA rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individualâs claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

i. Rules of AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the AAA Rules, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the AAA Rules and any claim that the AAA Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

j. Severability. If any provision of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Services. If any term, clause, or provision of this Section is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section will remain valid and enforceable.

k. Opt-Out Right. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by writing to support@steiffusa.com. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance. Should you choose not to opt out of this Dispute Resolution provision within the 30-day period, you and the Company will be bound by the terms of this Dispute Resolution provision. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Dispute Resolution provision. You understand that you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to opt out of coverage under this Dispute Resolution provision.
