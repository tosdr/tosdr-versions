------------------------------

To the maximum extent permitted by law, these Terms are governed by the laws of the state of California and the United States of America. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms including, but not limited to, this paragraph.

The performance of Sporcle per these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of the right to comply by Sporcle with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of information provided to or gathered by Sporcle with respect to such use.

Unless otherwise specified herein, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Sporcle with respect to the Site and these Terms supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Sporcle with respect to the Site.
