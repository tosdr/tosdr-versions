**5.   Fees**

5.1   Fees. In consideration of the performance of the Services, Customer agrees to pay PandaDoc, in full, the fees set forth in the applicable Order (“**Fees**”). Unless otherwise explicitly agreed upon by the parties in writing, all Orders are non-cancelable and Fees are non-refundable, and the Term as set forth in the Order is a continuous and non-divisible commitment for the full duration of the Term regardless of any invoice schedule. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties in writing, any unused portions of volume-based purchases shall expire at the end of the Term and will not roll over into subsequent Renewal Terms. All amounts due and payable by Customer to PandaDoc under this Agreement must be paid in full without any deduction, set-off, counterclaim or withholding of any kind unless required by law. 

5.2   Overages. In the event Customer exceeds the number of licensed users or the maximum number of units for a volume-based product purchased in an Order, PandaDoc may invoice Customer monthly for all additional units (whether licenses or volume-based units) added or used by Customer during the Term. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties in writing, (a) the fees for additional licensed users will be prorated based on the remainder of the then-current subscription term and the per unit fee on the Customer’s then current Order; and (b) the fees for such additional volume-based units will be equal to the applicable per unit fee on the Customers then current Order. If no per unit fee is provided on Customer’s then current Order, Customer will be charged at the per unit price provided on PandaDoc’s Site. Removal of licensed users from Customer’s subscription plan will not reduce the fees payable to PandaDoc hereunder.

5.3   Payment. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, all amounts due under this Agreement or an Order must be paid by Customer in United States dollars on receipt of the invoice, or fourteen (14) days after the date of the invoice for invoices over $2,500 USD. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, invoices will be sent via email. Customer shall remit payments due hereunder via wire transfer, ACH, or credit card, or for amounts over $5,000 USD by check. Customer will promptly notify PandaDoc in writing (via email) of any changes to Customer’s billing information. In the event payment dates fall on a weekend or holiday, the payments may be completed on the next business day. Except where prohibited by law, PandaDoc may charge Customer a late fee of 1.5% per month on any past due amounts, plus a recovery fee equal to the total expenses associated with collecting the past due amounts (including third party fees).

5.4   Pricing. PandaDoc may increase the unit price for a Service’s Renewal Term by issuing written notice to Customer prior to the start date of such Renewal Term (the “**Price Increase Notice**”). If a Service automatically renews under this Agreement, the annualized price for each unit of a Service for the Renewal Term will be the greater of (a) the published price on the Site, or (b) the annualized price for such Service unit during the Term, as may be increased by notice issued by PandaDoc pursuant to this Section 5.4. Discounts, credits and promotional or one-time pricing for the Term do not apply to the Renewal Term.

5.5   Monthly Plans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Customer is on a monthly plan with PandaDoc, (a) Customer will not receive the Price Increase Notice described in Section 5.4, (b) Customer’s Order will automatically renew every month at PandaDoc’s then published rates, and (c) Customer’s credit card will be charged monthly on or about the same day of the month that Customer initially signed up for the plan. If Customer cancels a monthly plan before an upcoming renewal date, Customer will have access to the purchased PandaDoc Services through the end of the then-current month.

5.6   Taxes. Other than income taxes imposed on PandaDoc, Customer will bear all taxes, levies and duties, including without limitation VAT (“**Taxes**”). Both parties acknowledge and agree that to the extent any services provided by PandaDoc may be subject to any sales or other applicable tax, Customer shall pay these taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction, except as specifically delineated below. Customer shall include payment of taxes in its submission of Fees and expenses to PandaDoc in U.S. dollars.

5.7   Resellers. Customer may elect to purchase certain Services through a reseller authorized by PandaDoc (“**Reseller**”). Customer’s access to and use of the Services purchased through a Reseller is subject to PandaDoc’s receipt of the applicable fees under the Order between Reseller and PandaDoc related to Customer’s purchase. Any claims for refunds owed hereunder must be directed to the Reseller. The terms of this Agreement may not be modified by any agreement between Customer and Reseller. 

5.8   Fee Disputes. If Customer has a bona fide dispute in relation to any portion of the Fees invoiced, Customer shall provide notice to PandaDoc in writing within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice containing the disputed Fees. Such notice shall set forth the details surrounding the dispute in specific detail so that PandaDoc may investigate the dispute. Upon resolution of the dispute, Customer shall pay all outstanding amounts determined to be payable per the resolution to PandaDoc within twenty (20) calendar days of the resolution. Customer waives the right to dispute any Fees not disputed within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the applicable invoice.

The Indemnified Party may reasonably participate in such defense and settlement, at its sole expense. 

8.4   Infringement Remedy. If Customer is enjoined or otherwise prohibited from using any of the Services or any portion thereof based on a Claim, PandaDoc will, at its sole expense and option: (a) obtain from such third party the right for Customer to continue to use the allegedly infringing portions of the Service (the “**Infringing Materials**”); (b) modify or replace the Infringing Materials so as to render them non-infringing without materially diminishing or impairing their functionality; or (c) if none of the foregoing remedies are commercially reasonable, terminate the applicable Order and provide a pro rata refund for any prepaid fees attributable to the terminated portion of the Services.
