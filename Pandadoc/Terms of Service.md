**5.1.** You can purchase a monthly or annual plan and your credit card on file will be charged on a recurring basis. All fees due and payable by you to PandaDoc under the Terms must be paid in full without any deduction, set-off, counterclaim or withholding of any kind unless required by law. All fees due and payable under the Terms are exclusive of applicable taxes, which will be added at the prevailing rate from time to time. When you sign up for a paid plan, you are agreeing to pay and take responsibility for all charges made in accordance with the chosen plan, and your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the subscription term unless you cancel as further set forth herein. PandaDoc reserves the right to change the fees and/or applicable charges at the conclusion of the initial term and in advance of the renewal coming into effect.

**5.2. Cancellation policy.** You agree to notify PandaDoc in writing of any changes to your account information or termination of its authorization at least thirty (30) days prior to the next billing date. Upon cancellation pursuant to this Section 5.2, you will pay all outstanding fees, taxes, charges and expenses owed under the Account, if applicable. However, no refunds (prorated or otherwise) are provided upon cancellation. In the interest of fairness to all of our clients, no exceptions will be made.

**5.3. Free 14-day trial.** PandaDoc offers a free 14-day trial for all of our plans. You are not required to enter payment information, but your plan will expire at the end of the 14th day (or earlier, at our discretion). If you choose to enter billing information, your first charge will occur at the end of the 14th day after your signup date. If you elect the 14-day trial and you cancel your Account before the end of the 14th day, you won’t be billed at all, even if you entered your billing information. If you do not purchase a plan during the 14-day trial period, the data you include may be permanently deleted.

**5.4. Monthly plan billing.** PandaDoc’s monthly plans provide month-to-month access, with monthly charges being made each renewal day (the same day of the month that you originally signed up for the plan). Monthly plans automatically renew every month. If you cancel before an upcoming renewal day, you will have access to your Account through the end of the then-current month.

**5.5. Annual plan billing**. PandaDoc’s annual plans provide year-to-year access and a substantial savings over the month-to-month plan. Annual charges will be made each renewal date (the same date of the year that you originally signed up for the plan). Annual plans automatically renew every year thereafter. If you cancel before an upcoming renewal date, you will have access to your Account through the end of the then-current year. 

**5.6. Failed charges; Suspension.** If your credit card on file is closed or the Account information is changed, or if, for any reason, a charge is rejected, you shall immediately update your Account or supply a new payment account, as appropriate. If you are unable to update your credit card account with appropriate information, then PandaDoc will send an invoice to you detailing the amount due. You must pay the amount due in full within seven (7) days after the date of the invoice. You agree to notify PandaDoc in writing of any changes to your Account information or termination of any authorization at least thirty (30) days prior to the immediately subsequent billing date. In the event payment dates fall on a weekend or holiday, you understand that the payments may be executed on the next business day. Unpaid amounts are subject to a late charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of Services. PandaDoc may, without liability to you, disable the password, Account and access to all or part of the Services if any fees owed are not paid within forty-five (45) days after such fees first becoming due and payable under the Terms. In the event of the foregoing, PandaDoc shall not be obligated to provide any and/or all of the Services until such fees are paid in full. Accounts that have been terminated may be reactivated if valid payment information is entered and the card can be successfully processed for all charges accrued on the Account since the failed credit card charge.

15\. Confidentiality
--------------------

**15.1 “Confidential Information”** means any non-public data, information and other materials regarding the products, software, services, customer list, or business of a party (and/or, if either party is bound to protect the confidentiality of any third party’s information, of a third party) provided to the other party where such information is marked or otherwise communicated as being “proprietary” or “confidential” or the like, or where such information should, by its nature, be reasonably understood to be confidential and/or proprietary. For clarification purposes, ‘Confidential Information’ includes ‘Personal Data,’ Personally Identifiable Information, Personal Information or similar term as defined under applicable data protection law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Software and any performance data, benchmark results, and technical information relating thereto, the Documentation, PandaDoc’s pricing information and the terms and conditions of this Agreement (but not its existence) shall be deemed the Confidential Information of PandaDoc. The party disclosing Confidential Information shall be referred to herein as the “Disclosing Party” and the party receiving Confidential Information shall be referred to herein as the “Receiving Party.” 

**15.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing,** Confidential Information shall not include information which: 

 i. is already or becomes known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party or independently of the Receiving Party’s knowledge of the Confidential Information and is not subject to an obligation of confidentiality;

ii. is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; 

iii. is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party without breach of this Agreement and/or from a third party without restriction as to disclosure, or is approved for release by written authorization of the Disclosing Party; or 

iv. was lawfully and demonstrably in the possession of the Receiving Party without an obligation of confidentiality and without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. 

**15.3 The Receiving Party agrees not to use** or disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose other than as necessary and appropriate to perform its obligations under this Agreement, including through dissemination to its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and subcontractors (and their employees) (collectively “Representatives”) who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound in writing to confidentiality obligation at least as protective as those herein. The Receiving Party will cause such Representatives to comply with this Agreement and will assume full responsibility for any failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Party will not transfer or disclose any Confidential Information to any third party without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent and without such third party having a contractual obligation (consistent with this Section 15) to protect and keep such Confidential Information confidential. The Receiving Party agrees to treat all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in the same manner as it treats its own similar proprietary information, but in no case will the degree of care be less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose information concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including providing a copy of this Agreement, to any or all of the following: (i) potential acquirers, merger partners, investors and their personnel, attorneys, auditors and investment bankers, solely in connection with the due diligence review of such party by persons and provided that the disclosures are made in confidence; (ii) the party’s outside accounting firm; or (iii) the party’s outside legal counsel. 

**15.4 If the Receiving Party is requested or required to disclose** any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information under a subpoena, court order, statute, law, rule, regulation or other similar requirement (a “Legal Requirement”), the Receiving Party will, if lawfully permitted to do so, provide prompt notice of such Legal Requirement to the Disclosing Party so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If the Disclosing Party is not successful in obtaining a protective order or other appropriate remedy and the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information, or if the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement in writing, the Receiving Party may disclose, without liability hereunder, such Confidential Information solely to the extent necessary to comply with the Legal Requirement.

**15.5 Insofar as User Content constitutes Personal Data** (or any related term) under applicable data protection law, Receiving Party shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Disclosing Party by 1) implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures (as is possible), 2) ensuring its compliance with legal obligations, and 3) make all information necessary to demonstrate lawful compliance available to Receiving Party.

**15.6 The parties agree that ownership of any Confidential Information** (including, without limitation, all Intellectual Property rights) in and to any materials owned by the other party shall remain exclusively with that party, and nothing in this Agreement shall imply that any right or license in respect of such Intellectual Property is being granted to the other party.

**15.7 Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement** and upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party will return to the Disclosing Party all copies of Confidential Information already in the Receiving Party’s possession or within its control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be entitled to keep copies of any records it is required to retain by law or regulation, and/or copies retained as part of the Receiving Party’s backup or record retention process, such as this Agreement, the proposal, and due diligence information provided by the Disclosing Party, which shall remain subject to the confidentiality terms set forth herein. Alternatively, with Disclosing Party’s prior written consent, the Receiving Party may destroy such Confidential Information; provided that the Confidential Information is: (i) destroyed in accordance with applicable law, rule or regulation; and (ii) is rendered unreadable, undecipherable and otherwise incapable of reconstruction, in which case an officer of the Receiving Party will certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that all such Confidential Information has been so destroyed. The obligations with respect to Confidential Information, as set forth in this Section 11, shall continue in force and effect for a period of five (5) years after termination or expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret of the Disclosing Party will be subject to the terms of this Agreement for as long as such information remains a trade secret under applicable law.

**15.8 Each party acknowledges that a breach of this Section 11** may result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages may not be sufficient, and each party agrees that the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek, in addition to its other rights and remedies hereunder or at law, injunctive or all other equitable relief, and such further relief as may be proper from a court of competent jurisdiction. The terms of this Section 15 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

**16\. Links**
--------------

The Services may integrate with and/or provide links to various other independent third-party products and/or services (“Linked Sites”) that may be of interest to you and are for your convenience only. PandaDoc does not control and/or endorse such Linked Sites and is neither responsible for their content nor responsible for the accuracy and/or reliability of any information, data, opinions, advice and/or statements contained within such Linked Sites. You will need to make your own independent judgment regarding your interaction with Linked Sites at your own risk. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Linked Site that you visit. PandaDoc reserves the right to terminate any link and/or linking program at any time in its sole and absolute discretion. We disclaim all warranties, express and implied, as to the accuracy, validity, and legality and/or otherwise of any materials and/or information contained on such Linked Sites.

17\. Miscellaneous
------------------

**17.1. Applicable Law.** To the extent International data protection laws apply to the processing of personal data between PandaDoc and the customer, the default Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) and attached Standard Contractual Clauses found at [PandaDoc DPA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fHyk7TqSO00ArHCXqzpZ6oRx1ZRN8vnf/view?usp=sharing) are incorporated by reference and form a part of these Terms of Service, unless expressly provided otherwise in writing by both parties. 

**17.2. Entire Agreement; Conflict.** Unless otherwise agreed to by PandaDoc and you in writing, the Terms (including, without limitation, the terms and conditions set forth herein and PandaDoc’s operating rules, policies and/or procedures as described above) constitutes the entire agreement between PandaDoc and you concerning the subject matter hereof. 

**17.3. Governing Law.** Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement and any access to or use of the Services will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. 

**17.4. Arbitration.** Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under the Terms shall be finally settled in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in the State of Delaware, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the Terms shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. You can opt-out and decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting PandaDoc within thirty (30) days from the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision (i.e.: the date you initially accepted the Terms).

(i) Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and PandaDoc in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND PANDADOC WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

(ii) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS SECTION 17.3 MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. In the event that this Section is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court located in the State of Delaware. 

**17.5. Reference.** You agree that we may reference you as our customer, and that we may reasonably use, on a royalty-free basis, your trademark and/or logo for such purpose.

**17.6. Severability.** If any part of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Terms and/or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term and/or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.

**17.7. Assignment.** You may not assign your rights under the Terms to any other party without PandaDoc’s express prior written consent; PandaDoc may assign its rights under the Terms without condition. The Terms will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

**17.8. Force Majeure.** Except for payment obligations, neither PandaDoc nor you will be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations on account of events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may include denial-of-service attacks, a failure by a third-party hosting provider or utility provider, shortages, riots, pandemics, fires, acts of God, war, strikes, terrorism, and governmental action.

**17.9. Survival.** All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, licenses of User Content, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity provisions and limitations of liability.

**17.10. No Waiver**. No waiver by either you and/or PandaDoc of any breach and/or default and/or failure to exercise any right allowed under the Terms is a waiver of any preceding and/or subsequent breach and/or default and/or a waiver and/or forfeiture of any similar and/or future rights under the Terms.
