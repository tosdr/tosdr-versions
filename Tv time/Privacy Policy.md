### 1\. Information We Collect and How We Collect It

We may collect information from you both directly and automatically when you use TV Time. Some of this information may be considered “personal information” under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name and email address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” where required by applicable law. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a “hash.” We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification process satisfies legal requirements. We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.

We collect information in the following ways:

* **Information You Submit Via TV Time**. In the course of using TV Time, you may provide us with certain information, including contact information (such as your name, email address, and social media username); information about your interests and preferences (such as your favorites and the episodes that you have watched); account information (such as your profile picture, username, and birthday); and demographic information (such as your gender and the country you are from). Some features may allow you to view, create, reproduce, submit, display, perform, and/or share content, which includes videos, audio, images, graphics, written posts, comments, and other forms of multimedia (collectively, “User Content”).
    
* **Information We Collect Automatically From Your Use of TV Time**. When you use TV Time, we, our third-party service providers, and our business partners may automatically collect certain information (“Usage Information”). One of the ways we collect Usage information is when you visit portions of TV Time, our servers automatically generate logs to help us determine how people travel through TV Time and to improve our services. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as personal information. This Usage Information includes your IP address and unique device identifiers (“Device IDs”) for your computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access TV Time. A Device ID is a number that is automatically assigned to your device, and our servers identify your device by its Device ID. We will also collect and track other data and information relating to your device, including entertainment-specific and/or streaming applications on your device, the Internet service provider you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the type of browser you use. We track your activities on TV Time such as the pages and content you access and your interactions with the content we provide. We may be able to infer your approximate location based on your IP address or similar information we collect.
    

We use the following types of tracking technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) to automatically collect information when you interact with us online:

* **Cookies and Local Storage** are small text files stored locally on your device that help store user preferences. These technologies are able to store a unique identifier for a device to us to recognize the device whenever the device is used to visit TV Time. These technologies may be used for many purposes by us, our service providers, and our third-party business partners, such as automatically collecting Usage Information, enabling features, serving advertisements to you online, and remembering your preferences. We may use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on TV Time, to study the effectiveness of our customer communications, to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through TV Time, and to personalize your experience through TV Time, such as to recognize you when you return to TV Time. The information we store includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your Internet browser. You can find more information about cookies and how they work at [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
    
* **Web beacons (also known as clear GIFs and pixel tags)** are small pieces of code used to collect usage analytics. They help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we will use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened.
    
    We use similar tools to collect such information from mobile devices. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.
    
* **Information from Third Parties**. We may receive information about you from third parties, such as data providers who enhance the information we have about you, publicly available information, or third parties that you integrate into TV Time, such as social media platforms or streaming services.
    
* **Social Media and Other Third Party Platforms**. We may permit you to interact with social media and other third party platforms, including Google, Apple, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. When you interact with third party platforms through TV Time, we will receive information about you. We may also receive information about you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or "friends." The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including, without limitation, whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service. We or the third party may allow you to disable or remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.
    
    If you choose to post information to a third party platform, that information may be public and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of TV Time. You may also choose to participate in a way that connects that third-party service with TV Time, such as posting to one of our pages on a social media site or sharing your watch history from a streaming service with us. Doing so may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information, and the third party may allow us to re-post content related to us on our own services.
    
    In addition, these third parties may set their own cookies and collect information about your use of TV Time, including your IP address or other device identifiers, and which pages you visit on TV Time. Certain third-party platforms may be able to collect certain information on your visits to TV Time regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties that control platforms you post to or that connect to TV Time and set your privacy preferences with them.
    

### 2\. How We Use Your Information

We may use non-personal information for any purpose, including for advertising, research, and marketing purposes. We also use information that we collect, including personal information and Usage Information, as disclosed in this Privacy Policy and as follows:

* in any other way we describe when you provide the information, or otherwise with your prior consent.

We may share non-personal information (including hashed or other de-identified data) with third parties for advertising and other purposes. We do not share your personal information with third parties for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes unless we provide you the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out prior to such sharing, as required by applicable law.

We do not control the actions of third parties and you post content and share your information at your own risk.
    
* **Service Providers.** We contract with certain companies to perform services on our behalf, including advertising, marketing assistance, e-mail delivery, hosting services, site maintenance and repair, security, quality assurance, customer service, surveys, trailers, and data research and analysis, and provide your information to them only to fulfill such services.
    
* **Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.** We may offer sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions (any of which, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the provisions, conditions, or official rules that govern the Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you (including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness, or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials). If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, as required by law, or as permitted by the Promotion’s terms or official rules (such as on a winner’s list).

In the event WNI undergoes a business transition, such as a merger with or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer your personal information and other information to the successor organization in connection with such transaction, including during the course of any due diligence. By providing your personal information, you agree that we may transfer such information to the other entity in such a transaction without your further consent. If material changes to TV Time’s privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, WNI or its successor will attempt to notify you, including by posting a notice on TV Time so that you can elect whether to delete your Account.

### 4\. Third Party Advertising and Analytics

WNI works with third party business partners such as online advertising companies, analytics providers, and other partners to serve our ads online, to serve third party ads through TV Time and to provide us with information regarding the use of TV Time and the effectiveness of our advertisements. We allow these companies to place tracking technologies like cookies and web tags on TV Time, and they may otherwise collect or have access to Usage Information and other information about you. Some of these parties may collect personal information over time when you visit TV Time or other online websites and services. We may share information, typically information that has been aggregated or de-identified, Usage Information, and location information with third party advertising companies, analytics providers, and other third parties including for targeted advertising purposes.

We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about the use of TV Time and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information about the use of other websites, apps, and online services. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites), and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

We use a variety of third parties to perform advertising and analytics services, and some of these companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). You may wish to visit[optout.networkadvertising.org](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1), which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the opt-out procedures of NAI members, including opt out mechanisms for web browsers, mobile and other connected devices, and a tool to opt out from participating NAI members using your hashed email address for interest-based advertising. You may also want to visit [optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN), which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an opt-out for DAA-participating companies. If you are a California resident, please see our “[Notice to California Residents](https://www.tvtime.com/privacy/#toc_14)” section below regarding additional rights you have, including how to exercise your “Do Not Sell” right.

**Options for the TV Time App**. Mobile devices may contain settings that allow you to disable tracking advertising and/or analytics. In addition, the digital advertising industry has provided the ability for mobile users to register their intent not to receive targeted advertising at [https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices).

Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising, and that you will continue to receive generic ads while online.

If you are a California resident, please see our [NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS](https://tvtime.com/privacy/#toc_14) regarding additional rights you have, including how to exercise your “Do Not Sell” right.

### 5\. Third Party Content and Links

When you navigate away from TV Time to another site, this Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Those Third Party Services may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies, may independently collect information from you or about you, and match your data with data from other sources and use your data in ways other than described in this Privacy Policy. Your browsing and interaction on any Third Party Services is subject to such Third Party Services’ own rules and policies, which we encourage you to review prior to providing them with your information.

We may also provide notice to you in other ways, such as through contact information you have provided.

However, we will provide notice and obtain your consent (opt-in or opt-out) if required. Note that you may no longer be able to use certain or any features of TV Time if you do not consent to the revised Privacy Policy.

### 10\. Consent to International Transfer of Your Information

We are a US-based company so if you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that the information that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of your country. By using TV Time or providing us with any information, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to this transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information in the United States and other jurisdictions, which may have different or less protective privacy laws than those in your country. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States and other countries according to the laws in those jurisdictions. Your information will also be disclosed to third parties as described in the “How We Share Your Information” section above.

### 11\. How Long We Retain Your Information

We will retain your information for so long as needed to provide the TV Time services to you, or as required to fulfill our legal requirements and defend legal claims. After you have terminated your use of TV Time, we will store your information in an aggregated and anonymized format.

### 13\. Notice to Nevada Residents

Nevada S.B. 220 provides consumers with the ability to opt out of the sale of their personal information. We do not sell your personal information as defined in S.B. 220. However, you may still submit an opt-out request, and if our practices were to change in the future, we would honor your request. If you are a Nevada resident and would like to opt out of the sale of your covered information, your request must be submitted to [support@tvtime.com](mailto:support@tvtime.com). Your request must include your full name, street address, city, state, zip code, and a valid email address so that we can contact you if needed regarding your request. If you previously provided a phone number, including it will assist us in making sure we identify you as someone who wants to opt out. You may be required to take reasonable steps as we determine from time to time to verify your identity and/or the authenticity of your request.

### 14\. Notice to California Residents

**This California Privacy Notice is effective as of April 22, 2024.**

This Notice supplements WNI’s Privacy Policy and applies only to California residents. We adopt this Notice to conform to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act, and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder (collectively, the “CCPA”). Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Section.

**EXERCISING YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS**

California residents have the right to request: (1) that we disclose to you what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell, including the right to request that we provide to you the categories and the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you ("Right to Know"); (2) that we delete the Personal Information we collected about you ("Right to Delete"); (3) that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you (“Right to Collect”), (4) to opt-out from the sharing of your Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., targeted advertising) (“Right to Opt-Out of Sharing”), (5) to opt-out from the sale of their Personal Information (“Right to Opt-Out of Sale”), and (6) that we limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) to purposes set forth under the CCPA, including what is necessary and anticipated to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services (“Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of SPI”), all subject to meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA. More information on how to exercise these rights is below.

Please note that our business activities do not use personal information in a manner that triggers the Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of SPI.

California residents have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising CCPA rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights.

**Verifying Your Requests**

Please note that we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity in order to fulfill your request. In order to verify your identity, we will request that you provide: your user ID, email address, and the most recent episode you marked as tracked.

In your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or their authorized representative. You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate and respond to it. We can’t respond to your request if we can’t verify your identity. Making such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity. When you exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, and/or Right to Correct, we may ask that you provide us with information, beyond the above, in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request.

If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request.

**Agents**

If you are an authorized representative submitting a request on a user’s behalf, please submit the request per the instructions below. We will follow up to request a signed, written permission signed by the individual who is the subject of the request authorizing you to make the request on their behalf. The written permission must state your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request and needs to be clear about the permission granted.

Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. In either case, please also indicate in your email the nature of your request. The consumer’s identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit a request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request.

**Submitting Your Requests**

If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your rights please email us at[legal@whipmedia.com](mailto:legal@whipmedia.com) or mail us your request at Whip Networks, Inc., 1841 Centinela Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404. Your request must include your username (if you have one) and email address; please also include any additional information that you have submitted to us that may help us verify you as set forth below.

**Other Important Information**

* Requests to Know
    
    In order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we will require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.
    
* Requests to Delete
    
    To ensure that we do not delete your personal information in response to a fraudulent request, once you submit the request, we may follow up to confirm that you want your information to be deleted.
    
* Do Not Sell or Share for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising
    
    The CCPA also provides California Consumers a right to request to opt-out of the sale and sharing of Personal Information (i.e., for targeted advertising). WNI does not sell Personal Information to third parties for financial gain. However, WNI does engage in online advertising practices (and certain analytics or similar activities), such as to provide you relevant marketing messages, which may potentially be considered “sales” or “sharing” under the CCPA under certain circumstances.[Click Here](https://www.tvtime.com/privacy) to manage your cookie preferences for the tvtime.com website.
    
    In addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance also offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CCPA to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of the participating companies. See: https://www.privacyrights.info/.
    

**DO NOT TRACK**

Some browsers incorporate a 'Do Not Track' (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them.

**DATA RETENTION**

We retain your Personal Information while you have an account with us and while you continue to use or visit any of the TV Time services. We will retain your Personal Information for as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this California Notice, considering the time period reasonably necessary to: provide the TV Time services to you; exercise the choices and rights you have requested; comply with our contractual obligations; enforce our terms for use; and comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including if a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.

**USERS YOUNGER THAN 16**

We do not knowingly sell or share personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION WNI COLLECTS**

We collect certain types of information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device (“Personal Information”). The Personal Information we collect about you will depend on how you use TV Time or otherwise interact with us. Accordingly, we may not collect all of the below information about you.

**Other California Rights**

California residents have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as WNI does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. WNI will provide you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time WNI offers that choice, we will not share your personal information with that third party for its direct marketing purposes.
