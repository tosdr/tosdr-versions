**I aim to collect as little personal data as possible.** I don’t know who you are, where you’re from or how you found me.

I don’t use any cookies or third party companies to track you.

For security reasons my hosting provider ([Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/)) collects your IP address, user agent, and requested URL. The information is stored for 30 days before being deleted.

On some pages I embed services like [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) and [Speaker Deck](https://www.speakerdeck.com/). Those services may collect personal data. For more information, see their own privacy notices.

If you contact me, your personal data will be stored in [Gmail](https://gmail.com/). All data in Gmail is stored using two-factor authentication.

If you have any questions or would like me to delete your personal data, please [contact me](https://daveredfern.com/contact/).
