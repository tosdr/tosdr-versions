Service Level Agreement
=======================

Hexasoft Development Sdn. Bhd. (“FraudLabs Pro”) is committed to providing reliable, high-quality web services or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to support its customers. Providing you with consistent access to our services is a high priority for FraudLabs Pro and is part of the reason FraudLabs Pro makes commitments in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that provide certain rights and remedies regarding the availability and performance of FraudLabs Pro’s network and services. The SLA also aims to provide clarity for customers by outlining general guidelines and expectations for our working partnership.

Service Coverage Definitions
----------------------------

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) section applies to you (“Customer”) if you have subscribed and paid for any of the commercial web services or APIs from FraudLabs Pro (the “Services”) and your account is current (i.e., not past due) with FraudLabs Pro. As used herein, the term “Service Availability” means the percentage of a particular month (based on 24-hour days for the number of days in the subject month) that the Customers can access to the “Services”, as measured by FraudLabs Pro. This SLA excludes users under free plans.

Service Levels
--------------

1. Goal: FraudLabs Pro’s goal is to achieve 99.99% Service Availability for all Customers.
2. Remedy: Subject to table below, if the Service Availability of Customer is less than 100%, FraudLabs Pro will issue a credit in terms of API queries to Customer in accordance with the following schedule, with the credit being calculated on the basis of the monthly service charge for the affected Services.

| Service Availability | Credit Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| 99% to 100% | 0%  |
| < 99% | 50% |
| < 90% | 100% |

Service Availability Exceptions
-------------------------------

Customer shall not receive any credits under this SLA in connection with any failure or deficiency of Service Availability caused by or associated with:

1. circumstances beyond FraudLabs Pro’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of any governmental body, war, insurrection, sabotage, armed conflict, embargo, fire, flood, strike or other labor disturbance, interruption of or delay in transportation, unavailability of or interruption or delay in telecommunications or third party services, virus attacks or hackers, failure of third party software (including, without limitation, ecommerce software, payment gateways, chat, statistics or free scripts) or inability to obtain raw materials, supplies, or power used in or equipment needed for provision of this SLA;
2. failure of access circuits to the FraudLabs Pro, unless such failure is caused solely by FraudLabs Pro;
3. scheduled maintenance and emergency maintenance and upgrades;
4. Domain Name Server (DNS) propagation or other DNS issues outside the direct control of FraudLabs Pro;
5. issues with Customer’s shopping cart platforms or softwares;
6. false SLA breaches reported as a result of outages or errors of any FraudLabs Pro measurement system;
7. Customer’s acts or omissions (or acts or omissions of others engaged or authorized by Customer), including, without limitation, custom scripting or coding (e.g., CGI, Perl, HTML, ASP, etc), any negligence, willful misconduct, or use of the Services in breach of FraudLabs Pro’s Terms and Conditions and Acceptable Use Policy;
8. e-mail or webmail delivery and transmission;
9. outages elsewhere on the Internet that hinder access to your account. FraudLabs Pro is not responsible for browser or DNS caching that may make your site appear inaccessible when others can still access it. FraudLabs Pro will guarantee only those areas considered under the control of FraudLabs Pro.

Network Availability Credit Request
-----------------------------------

In order to receive additional credits, the Customer must make a request by sending an email message to support. Each request in connection with this SLA must include the Customer's name, email address, and the dates and times of the unavailability of Customer’s web service and must be received by FraudLabs Pro within ten (10) business days after Customer's web service was not available. If the unavailability is confirmed by FraudLabs Pro, additional credits will be applied in the next monthly cycle after FraudLabs Pro receipt of the Customer's credit request. Credits are not refundable and can be used only towards future billing charges.

Charges, Payments and Credits
-----------------------------

Unless otherwise set forth in the Terms of Use Agreement, FraudLabs Pro invoices for all services monthly in advance and payment is due upon receipt. Any services that are suspended due to non-payment may be subject to a reinstatement fee to restore services. Each invoice will be deemed correct and indisputable unless the Customer disputes such invoice in writing, specifically identifying the disputed charges, within 30 days of issuance of the applicable invoice. All undisputed amounts on such invoices must be paid by the due date, regardless of the existence of any disputed amounts. Disputed amounts that FraudLabs Pro determines to be in error or not in compliance with a specific Terms of Use Agreement will be adjusted as a credit on a subsequent invoice. Any credit provided for disputed items or services will be for the original invoiced amount of the disputed item or service and will not exceed more than the value of 90 days of the disputed item or service. Research and credit for disputed charges will not extend beyond 90 days of historic data from the date of Customer notice. Any disputed amounts that FraudLabs Pro reasonably determines to be correct will be due and payable by the Customer upon notice of such determination.

Cancellation of Services
------------------------

FraudLabs Pro requires any cancellation of services to be done through the customer area in FraudLabs Pro’s website by the Customer. Customers will be liable for any normal monthly fees until services are canceled or downgraded with proper steps as outlined above.

Additional Information
----------------------

Account credits are not refundable and can be used only towards future billing charges.

Additional or alternate terms and conditions may apply to individual Customers and Services as outlined in a specific Service Contract Agreement made between Customer and FraudLabs Pro at commencement of services. If present, please refer to the Service Contract Agreement for any additional or alternate terms and conditions. All terms and conditions outlined in this SLA are in effect for all Customers with the exception of specific terms or conditions that are countered in a signed Service Contract Agreement with FraudLabs Pro. Any modifications or exceptions contained in a Customer’s Service Contract Agreement only affect those specific terms and conditions with the remainder of this SLA in effect.

Note: FraudLabs Pro reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this SLA and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner. Notice of any revision, amendment, or modification will be posted at [https://www.fraudlabspro.com/sla](https://www.fraudlabspro.com/sla).
