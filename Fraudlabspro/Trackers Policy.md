Cookie Notice
=============

Effective on: Apr 2, 2020

Last updated on January 1, 2024

Introduction and Scope
----------------------

This Cookie Notice (the "Notice") is designed to assist you in understanding how and why Hexasoft Development Sdn. Bhd ("Hexasoft", "we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and other similar technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") on our website [https://www.fraudlabspro.com](https://www.fraudlabspro.com/) and any webpage linking to this Notice (collectively, the "Website") to collect and develop data. We use Tracking Technologies to allow our Website to operate, increase its functionality and efficiency, analyze how you use it so that we can improve it, tailor the content and information that we display to you, and assist our customers to provide you with targeted advertisements.

To the extent that information collected by the Cookies constitutes personal data (on its own or if combined with other information), our [Privacy Policy](https://www.fraudlabspro.com/privacy-policy) shall apply to the processing of such personal data, as defined in the Privacy Policy.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
---------------------------------------

A cookie is a small text file stored on your device that contains information about your browser and online activity. Our Website may also employ a software technology called clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons) that helps us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Website users. We may also use local shared objects (a.k.a. "flash cookies"), pixels, or other similar technologies. All of these tracking technologies are collectively referred to as "Tracking Technologies" in this Notice.

How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals
--------------------------------------

"Do-Not-Track" is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. We commit to user privacy by honoring Do Not Track (**"DNT"**) browser settings.

Opting Out
----------

You can alter the configuration of your browser to reject certain types of Tracking Technologies. Note, if you reject certain cookies, you may not be able to access and use all of the features on our Website. You may also set your browser to send a Do Not Track (DNT) signal. For more information, please visit [https://www.aboutcookies.org/](https://www.aboutcookies.org/) and [https://allaboutdnt.com/](https://allaboutdnt.com/).

You may also control your online behavioral advertising preferences and opt out from having your data processed by certain marketing companies by visiting [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) and [http://optout.aboutads.info/](http://optout.aboutads.info/). Please note that managing these preferences will not turn off internet advertisements in general. You will receive the same amount of advertisements, but it will be less reflective of your interests, as based on your web browsing habits. The opt-out preferences that you set may be nullified if you delete your cookies.

Types of Cookies
----------------

We use both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies are deleted or removed when you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be retained after you close your browser but have an expiration date.

Some of the cookies placed on your device through our Website are first-party cookies, since they are placed directly by us. Other parties, such as Google, may also set their own (third-party) cookies through our Website. When you visit our Website, those third parties may collect personal data about your online activities over time and across different Internet websites or online services. Please refer to the privacy policies of these third parties to learn more about the way in which they collect and process information about you.
