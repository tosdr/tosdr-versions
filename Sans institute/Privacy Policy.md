### Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

Where applicable, SANS adheres to a U.S. federal law called the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) that protects student educational records. The Act serves two primary purposes: It gives eligible students more control over their educational records, and it prohibits educational institutions from disclosing “personally identifiable information” in education records without the written consent of an eligible student or in certain other circumstances. To review our full FERPA policy, please visit the [Federal Education Rights Privacy Act Policy.](https://www.sans.edu/ferpa-policy/)  

### Children’s Personal Information

SANS does not knowingly collect or retain personal information about persons under the age of 16.  Any person who provides their personal information to SANS represents they are 16 or older.  When a person is under the age of 16 and desires to provide personal information to SANS, SANS strives to seek appropriate parental consent to process their information.  If SANS learns that it has collected personal information from an individual under the age of 16 without parental consent, SANS will take reasonable measures to delete such information (except where required to protect the individual or others or as required or allowed by law).  If you believe SANS has personal information from individuals under the age of 16, please contact SANS at [privacy@sans.org](mailto:privacy@sans.org).

### Other Important Information

#### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. Be aware that the internet is a global communications vehicle open to threats, viruses, and intrusions from others, so we cannot promise - and you should not expect - that we will be able to protect your personal information in all circumstances.
