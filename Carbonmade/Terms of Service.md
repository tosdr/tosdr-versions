COPYRIGHT DISPUTE POLICY

  
We are dedicated to operating in accordance with the US Copyright Law and require you to comply as well. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA") provides owners of copyrighted material who suspect that their rights under U.S. Copyright Law have been violated with certain remedies. One such remedy is contacting the Internet service provider’s designated agent to report suspected infringements that appear on website and Internet pages hosted by that Internet service provider.

If we receive a notification of suspected copyright infringement, and assuming the notification satisfies the requirements of the DCMA (discussed below), we may remove or prohibit access to such materials. However, you may submit to us a counter-notice if you believe such notice of suspected copyright infringement was mistakenly filed.

You should seek your own legal counsel if: (i) you believe your copyrights have been infringed, or (ii) if a notice of copyright infringement has been filed against you. We will not be involved as a party to disputes over alleged copyright infringement and you agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any costs, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) we incur arising out of or related to any alleged or actual infringement involving you.

We reserve the right to terminate your account or remove any content if we, in our sole discretion, believe the DMCA notification meets the criteria listed below.
