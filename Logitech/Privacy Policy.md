We do not sell your personal information, and we will not do so in the future without providing you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out. If you require this notice in an alternative format, please email [privacy@logitech.com](mailto:privacy@logitech.com) or call our toll-free number +1 800 711 8156.

Logitech collects and uses various types of personal information when you use its products and services, which are described within the Logitech Product and Web Privacy Policies.

Logitech shares personal data with third parties for business purposes. Specifically, here are the seven categories of activities for which we share data for business purposes:

* Auditing
* Security
* Debugging and Technical Troubleshooting
* Short term, transient use (personal information is not disclosed to third parties and it is not used to build profiles)
* Performing Services
* Internal Research
* Testing or Product/Service Improvement

If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what personal information has been collected about you, how we use, share and disclose it, and to access that information. You also have the right to request that we delete your personal information, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow us to retain and use certain personal information.

We do not sell your personal information. In limited circumstances we share your personal information for advertising. You can “opt-out” of having your personal information used for this purpose by contacting us at [support.logitech.com/response-center](https://support.logitech.com/response-center).

You can learn more about how to submit a data rights request through contact details located within this policy. You may also send your request by email to [privacy@logitech.com](mailto:privacy@logitech.com) or call our toll-free number +1 800 711 8156. An agent may submit a request on your behalf, but you must provide proof that the agent is authorized to do so by providing the agent with a signed letter giving permission to submit a request on your behalf and you must confirm that authorization directly with us by sending an email to [privacy@logitech.com](mailto:privacy@logitech.com).

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny you goods or services, charge different prices or rates, or provide a different service level for exercising your privacy rights. However, we may offer certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, discounts or quality levels. Any incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information and will only be collected or processed with your consent.

California’s Shine the Light Law
--------------------------------

Separate from the CCPA, California’s Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to ask companies what personal information they share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their goods or services to you unless you request it.

Creativity and Productivity Products
------------------------------------

Logitech Creativity & Productivity include hardware like mice, keyboards, touchpads, presenters, webcams, and headsets, and related software and services like Logitech Options and Options+ (Logitech Options), Logitech Capture, Logitech Presentation, Setpoint, and Logitech Control Center. We use data we collect relating to these products and services for a variety of purposes described above, including security, stability and product performance. The Privacy Policy applies to these products, but there are a few distinctions as noted below.

Read more

Backup and Transfer of Device Settings
--------------------------------------

Logitech Options allows you to customize your mice, keyboards, and touchpads on your computer. Logitech Capture software allows you to record video and audio on your computer and change the settings of the camera. This software also offers you the ability to back up your device settings to the cloud so you can transfer those settings to other computers and set up your devices easily.

Information that may be collected includes:

* Account information like name, email address, and password to create an account or if you use a third-party open authorization (OAuth2) like Facebook or Google to log in.
* Computer information like the name, make, and model of the computer to ensure the device works correctly.
* Logitech Options specific information:

* Button and key customizations, including app-specific customizations
* Other device settings like point and scroll settings of your mouse
* Analytics data is collected subject to your consent

* Logitech Capture specific information:

* Scene composition and camera settings

With Logitech Options, device settings get backed up automatically. You can choose to not have your device settings backed up automatically or log out, effectively turning off the backup functionality.

Software Updates
----------------

Our servers automatically record certain information, including the IP address, the software version, and the connected devices to check for necessary software updates and download the required device images or assets, during and after the installation of our software.

Performance, Diagnostics and Analytics
--------------------------------------

With your consent, some of our software (like Logitech Options, Capture, Presentation app, Setpoint, and Logitech Control Center) collect and record information about the software, devices, and other information such as:

* usage of software features;
* customization of your devices;
* system hardware and software like OS version;
* city-level location information using IP address;
* device usage frequency like click, and button count. For example, so that we can analyze the durability and dependability of our products, we may capture how many times each button is used during the course of 24 hours;
* Logitech Capture-specific information – we capture scene usage and camera model information. We do not analyze or transmit audio or video from the user.
* Logitech Presenters capture when you start and end a presentation, along with the application name and version you are using. We collect this information so that we can help improve functionality.

We do not collect the data you insert while using your mice, keyboards or touchpads. A Keystroke assignment refers to when you customize your device and assign a shortcut, our apps require permission from you in order to perform the assigned shortcut.

Product Functionality
---------------------

We sometimes collect data like device and application information for product features to function properly. For example, Logitech Flow is a feature in some devices that allows you to seamlessly switch between two or three computers, and transfer text, images, and files from one computer to another. To enable automatic discovery of computers during the setup process of Flow, we may collect your device identifier and IP address.

Logi AI Prompt Builder
----------------------

The Logi AI Prompt Builder is an additional feature in Options designed to facilitate your interaction with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Logitech’s processing of personal data is limited to collecting data as described in the Performance, Diagnostics and Analytics section above.

Logitech does not share any personal data or other data with OpenAI, nor does OpenAI share any personal data or other data with Logitech.

Cameras and Products
--------------------

Logitech Circle and Mevo cameras are wireless or wired cameras with their respective software applications that can be used for a variety of purposes at home and at work. The Circle cameras provide users with rich video and audio recordings accessible from a mobile device or computer. The Mevo cameras provide users with high quality video and audio for live streaming and recording. The Privacy Policy applies to these products, but there are a few distinctions as noted below.

Read more

Activation and Registration
---------------------------

To activate and register your products, you provide information to us to create an account, including your name, email address, password, credit card (if you subscribe to premium services), camera name, and camera settings.

We also offer activation and registration through third party open authorization (OAuth2) services, such as Facebook and YouTube so you can share clips you’ve selected and go live on that service. For this purpose, we use services such as the YouTube API Services and, as a result, you are subject to third party privacy policies such as the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Google's security settings](https://myaccount.google.com/connections?filters=3,4&hl=en). Our apps adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements section.

While setting up the product, the country code of operation needs to be set. Some operating systems may prompt for location data access when determining the country code of operation.

Circle Video and Audio Recordings
---------------------------------

When you use Circle products and services, our servers automatically receive, record, and process data necessary to provide the service as well as information from the devices you use to view or listen to the data, including:

* video and audio recordings;
* device-specific information like hardware model, operating system version, and device identifiers such as MAC address, mobile network information, router names and meta-data concerning Apple Home Hubs and other Apple HomeKit devices;
* service event logging information;
* time and date of service use;
* on/off, and other interaction with the product;
* crashes, system activity, and hardware settings; and
* geo-location information (when location services are enabled)

Circle products may send pseudonymous information to an analytics tool, including timestamps, transmission statistics, feature usage, performance metrics, errors, etc. We use the pseudonymous information to provide, enhance, and improve our services, features, technical support and information.

Circle Features
---------------

Circle products have features that, if enabled, require us to collect and analyze data intelligently for them to work. For example, Smart Location automatically detects when you leave the house or come home, and Smart Alerts intelligently analyze motion to make sure you only get relevant alerts.

Circle Security and Storage
---------------------------

We have implemented Circle products so that no Logitech employee, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or governmental entity can access unencrypted footage. Every Circle camera has a unique private key and digital certificate, which is used to encrypt communications in transit. The Circle servers use AES 256 Bit Dual Layer Encryption to store your footage encrypted-at-rest.

Data collected is stored directly within the application, on your Device, and on servers in the U.S. or other countries where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers have facilities. We will retain collected information for as long as needed to provide the service and in accordance with the Logitech Privacy Policy.

Circle Cameras with Apple HomeKit Support
