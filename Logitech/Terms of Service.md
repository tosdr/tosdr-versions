NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION RECEIVED BY LOGITECH, ITS SUPPLIERS, OR OBTAINED OTHERWISE WILL CHANGE THIS DISCLAIMER. Some jurisdictions do not allow these limitations, so the above limitations may not apply in your jurisdiction.

#####   
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT LOGITECH (OR LOGITECH’S OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, INVESTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AGENTS, ASSIGNEES, REPRESENTATIVES, SUPPLIERS, PARTNERS, OR EMPLOYEES) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES OR ANY SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA, PROFITS, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF LOGITECH HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THIS WEBSITE, REMOVAL OR TERMINATION OF THIS WEBSITE, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA, ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN CONTENT ON THIS WEBSITE, STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THIS WEBSITE, INSTRUCTION, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY OR LINKED FROM THIS WEBSITE, OR ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THIS WEBSITE.

Some jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, do not allow these limitations, so the above limitations do not apply in New Jersey and may not apply in your jurisdiction.

#####   
Indemnification

You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Logitech, its affiliates, and their respective officers, employees, and agents from any and all claims, demands, damages, costs, and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your acts or omissions that arise from your wrongful use of this Website in violation of its terms. Logitech reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you agree to cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim. The foregoing indemnification provision shall not apply to the extent that any claims, demands, damages, costs, or liabilities, are the result of Logitech’s own negligence, fraud, willful injury or willful violation of law.

#####   
Disclosure of use

Logitech may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity), any transmittals or communications by you, and your use of this Website or any services made available on this Website if we determine that such disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with legal process, (2) comply with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of this Website, (3) enforce these Terms of Use, (4) respond to claims that any such data violated the rights of others, or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Logitech, its employees, and visitors to or users of this Website, including Logitech’s customers, and the public.

#####   
Termination

You agree that Logitech may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Website and/or block your future access to the Website if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements or guidelines that may be associated with your use of the Website, or for other reasons that may include but are not limited to (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you to remove your account, (3) discontinuance or material modification of the Website or any service offered on or through the Website, or (4) unexpected technical issues or problems.

In the event this agreement is terminated, the restrictions regarding Content or materials appearing on the Website, and the representations and warranties, indemnities, and limitations of liabilities set forth in these Terms of Use will survive termination. In the event that you are unsatisfied with the Website or any services that may be provided by Logitech, your sole remedy is to terminate this agreement.

If Logitech does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms of Use, Logitech will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any injunctive or equitable relief granted to Logitech. You agree that Logitech will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the Website.

#####   
Miscellaneous

Logitech may assign these Terms at any time to any subsidiary, or any affiliated company, or as part of the sale to, merger with, or other transfer of Logitech to another entity. You may not assign this agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Logitech regarding this subject matter, and they govern your use of this Website. The failure of Logitech to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, except in New Jersey, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Website or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
