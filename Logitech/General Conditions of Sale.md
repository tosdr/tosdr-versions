#### Orders

**What is my order status?**

If you logged in or created an account during checkout, you can look up your order [here](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/my-account/my-orders.html "My Orders"). If you used guest checkout, please look up your order [here](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/order-status.html "Find My Orders").

For items in stock, orders usually ship within 1-2 business days. Please be aware that some orders may be delayed by order processing or other issues. Once the order is processed, you will receive a shipment confirmation email with shipment tracking information. Shipping time is dependent on the shipping method selected at checkout.

**What payment methods do you accept?**

We accept PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, MasterCard/EuroCard, Discover, American Express, Diner's Club, JCB, Klarna, and check cards or ATM cards, so long as they are connected with one of the major credit card companies listed above. We also accept wire transfers. If you choose to pay by wire transfer, you will receive instructions on how to send your payment once you submit your order.

You can safely enter your entire credit card number via our secure server, which encrypts all submitted information.

**When will my credit card be charged?**

If you have ordered physical products we don't think you should pay for your order until it is actually on its way. We will not bill you until your product(s), including backordered or preordered items, are actually shipped. If your items are shipped separately you will be billed each time an item is shipped.

Important note on card charges:

* Pre-authorizations\*\* on credit cards are based on the confirmation of your order
* Credit card charges are based on the shipment of your order
* Cash Debit card charges are based on the confirmation of your order

\*\* A pre-authorization is a temporary hold to verify that funds are available when you place an order. Pre-authorizations are typically removed from your credit card transaction history when the full charge processes and funds are withdrawn. However, in some cases, this process can take up to 2 business days.

If you use PayPal or PayPal Express you will be billed upon ordering.

If you used “Buy now, pay later” with Klarna, please visit Klarna’s [website](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/) for more information.

**My credit card has been charged more than once for my purchase.**

If you have recently placed an order through the Logitech online store, the duplicate charge you are seeing is likely the result of a pre-authorization hold.

A pre-authorization is a temporary hold to verify that funds are available when you place an order. Pre-authorizations are typically removed from your credit card transaction history when the full charge processes and funds are withdrawn. However, in some cases, this process can take up to 2 business days.

If the duplicate charge on your credit card is the result of having placed more than one order in error, we are happy to assist you in obtaining a refund within 30 days of purchase. Please visit our Refund Policy.

**How will the charge show up on my credit card?**

The charge will appear on your credit card as: "DRI\*Logitech Store"

**Do I have to pay sales tax?**

Depending on the order, sales tax may be calculated and charged. Any sales tax charged will be indicated once your billing and/or shipping address have been entered during checkout.

The price indicated includes anticipated VAT that we will collect from you based on information you make available to us. The total price may change during the course of the shopping session depending on a number of factors. However, you will have the opportunity to review the final price we will charge before you submit your order.

We will gladly credit sales tax for government institutions. Just email us a copy of your tax-exemption form with an address matching your order's billing or shipping address to cstaxexemptions@digitalriver.com. Please include a copy of your receipt or your order number.

**I need a copy of my invoice.**

To view your invoice, find the order on your account's [My Orders](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/my-account/my-orders.html "My Orders") page and click the "Order Details" button. If you used guest check out, please look up your order [here](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/order-status.html "Find My Orders").

**What address should I enter in the billing information screen?**

For credit card verification, you must enter the address exactly as it appears on your credit card statement.

**Should I put spaces or dashes in the Credit Card number?**

No. Your card number should be entered in as a continuous string of numbers.

**Why are you not accepting my credit card?**

Please note that our accepted payment methods are PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, MasterCard/EuroCard, Discover, American Express, Diner's Club, JCB, Klarna, and check cards or ATM cards, so long as they are connected with one of the major credit card companies listed above. If you are using an accepted payment method, but the payment is not going through, please reach out to the payment provider.

**When will my pre-order ship?**

Pre-ordered products will ship when the product becomes available. You will be notified by email if the anticipated release date has changed or when your product has shipped. As a reminder, your credit card will not be charged until your order has been shipped, unless you used Paypal or PayPal Express at checkout. If you use PayPal or PayPal Express, you will be billed upon ordering.

**Can I change the shipping method on my pre-order?**

Unfortunately, you cannot change your shipment method after your order has been submitted.

**When will I be charged for my pre-order?**

When paying with a credit card you will not be charged until the products has shipped. When paying with PayPal the funds will be transferred when you submit your order. You will receive a confirmation email when your product shipped.

**What is the return policy for Pre-order products?**

Pre-Order products have a 30 day refund policy from the day the product ships.

**Who can I contact if I have questions about my pre-order product once I receive it?**

For technical assistance for your product, please visit our [Support Site](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us "Support Contact").

If you have questions pertaining to your order you can contact us at [https://support.logi.com/hc/requests/new?ticket\_form\_id=360000621393](https://support.logi.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000621393).

If you have any billing questions regarding your order, please contact us at [https://support.logi.com/hc/requests/new?ticket\_form\_id=360000621393](https://support.logi.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000621393).

**What is an Auto-Renew Subscription?**

Auto-renewal will allow you to easily maintain your subscription by automatically renewing it at the then current renewal price (plus applicable tax). By checking the box and providing your credit or debit card billing information, you agree that your product subscription will automatically renew for successive renewal terms, and you expressly authorize and permit DR globalTech, Inc. ("DR") to bill each product subscription renewal fee to the credit or debit card you have provided, until you cancel the automatic renewal and billing of your product subscription or DR discontinues the automatic renewal and billing option.

You have complete control over your product subscription and may cancel your auto-renewal at any time. Your order confirmation and confirmation email will include instructions on how to cancel automatic renewal and billing of your subscription. If you discontinue or do not select automatic renewal and billing of your subscription, you must manually renew your subscription to prevent interruption of service. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, do not check the box, provide your credit or debit card information, or complete this sale.

If you decide you no longer wish to participate in the Auto-Renew program, you can submit your request to cancel Auto-Renew [here](https://support.logi.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000621393 "Support page") or manage your subscriptions from your account's [Services](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/my-account/services.html "Services page") page. You can also find your order [here](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/order-status.html "Digital River Find My Order") and follow the instructions.

**How will my subscription be automatically renewed?**

If you are registered for Auto-Renew services, you will receive reminder emails about two weeks before your current subscription expires. You can easily cancel Auto-Renew by following the links in the emails. Otherwise, you can do nothing and your subscription will be automatically renewed.

About a week before the expiration date, your subscription will be renewed automatically at a price lower than or equal to the most current standard product price. The charge will be made on the same credit card you used for your original purchase. You will then receive an Auto-Renew confirmation email upon successful renewal. Your product(s) should automatically be available.

**What do I do if I forgot my account password?**

Please use the "Forgot my password" link on the [login page](https://www.logitech.com/login.html "login page").

**Pricing**

Prices, specifications, availability and terms of offers may change without notice. We reserve the right to cancel your order, in whole or in part, if the price is not valid or posted in error at the time of your order submission. Not responsible for typographical or illustrative errors.

**Why do I need to accept cookies?**

Cookies are placed on your browser for your convenience, and the Commerce System used is cookie dependent. When you place an order, information is written onto your hard drive. The next time you place an order, the system recognizes who you are and automatically enters your information into the form.  

Because cookies read information on your hard drive, some think this means they give access to all the information on your computer. Our commerce system encrypts all cookies and they cannot be read by any other web page. The cookie actually contains no personal information, just a unique identifier for our system to recognize this browser.

**Are cookies a security risk?**

No. Because cookies read information on your hard drive, some think this means they give access to all the information on your computer. Our commerce system encrypts all cookies and they cannot be read by any other web page. The cookie actually contains no personal information, just a unique identifier for our system to recognize this browser.

**How do I set up my browser to accept cookies?**

If you're using Internet Explorer 6+, go to the Tools menu and select Internet Options. Within the Internet Options window, select the Privacy tab. The default browser setting is medium, which allows you to accept cookies. To change this setting, move the slider to determine which setting you prefer. If your setting has been set to Custom, click the Advanced button and choose Accept Cookies.  

If you're using Internet Explorer 5.x, go to the Tools menu and select Internet Options. Within the Internet Options window, select the Security tab. Select Internet, then Custom Level. Scroll down to Cookies and choose Enable.

#### Privacy and Security

**What is your Privacy Policy?**

[Click here](https://store.digitalriver.com/store?Action=DisplayDRPrivacyPolicyPage&Locale=en_US&SiteID=defaults "Digital River's Privacy Policy") to view the Digital River privacy policy.

**What is the Digital River Secure & Virus Free Protection?**

We take your shopping safety very seriously. You can shop with confidence knowing that we have taken steps to ensure you are protected when you order through any Digital River network member. So, you can rest assured when shopping with us because the Digital River Secure & Virus Free Protection provides you with shopping protection and peace of mind!

Here are the details:

1. You pay nothing if any unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping with us.
    
    Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank holds you liable for any of this $50.00, Digital River will cover your entire liability, up to the full $50.00. Digital River will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made through a Digital River network member while using the Digital River secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with their reporting rules and procedures and provide Digital River with reasonable requested supporting documentation.
    
2. 100% of software downloads available through Logitech have been scanned for viruses.
    
    In the unlikely event your software downloaded from a Digital River network member contains a virus, Digital River agrees to either replace the affected software or refund the purchase price plus any shipping costs associated with the affected software. Digital River's liability is limited to the replacement or refund of only the virus-infected software downloaded from a Digital River network member. Digital River will cover this liability only if the virus resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made through a Digital River network member while using the Digital River secure server. Digital River does not assume liability for any costs associated with repairing or replacing any computer components, hardware, additional software, computer files, or any other costs associated with repairing, replacing, or removing virus-infected files from your computer.
    
3. All information that you provide while shopping is encrypted.
    
    Because we accept sensitive information from shoppers (name, mailing address, credit card number, and so on) Digital River uses VeriSign® Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect personal shopper information. This logic encrypts data being sent and received using high-level encryption technology. This technology assigns undetectable codes to data transmissions that only our server and shoppers can validate. This ensures that no external party can view the data.
