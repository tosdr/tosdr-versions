Do not sell my data

We would like you to know that we do not sell any of your information or data to third parties; all information and personal data is processed for the purpose of providing you our Voicemod Products and analyse them so that we can offer you the best possible.

**How we disclose your information** 

Sometimes we have to team up with other folks to get stuff done. So we might share some information with providers or vendors we bring on board, specifically, payment platforms like Xsolla and Paddle to process any payment regarding our Products. To deliver you any physical products, we´ll share your address with the courier or shipping company. We also have cloud service providers like Google and AWS, which host our data and keep things running smoothly, and some handy tools and software to analyse how our users interact with Voicemod.

We may also share information about you that has been made anonymous, so that it cannot be easily used to identify you. We might use this anonymized information to give our partners or the public an idea of how awesome Voicemod is with some cool user stats.

**Data retention** 

We hang on to your personal information for as long as we need it for the purposes we processed it. But there are certain rules and laws that come into play, which we are always mindful of. We might hold onto some data even if we don’t really need it anymore. Why? To make sure we’re covered when it comes to legal obligations, like taxes and other important business matters. We might even have to keep it if the law or the Security Forces or Courts ask us to. But fear not! Once we’re free to let it go, we’ll make sure to delete it for good.

Oh, and just so you know, any data we block and hang onto won’t be used by Voicemod. It’s all anonymized and locked away, far from our reach.

**International data transfers** 

Voicemond runs the show from sunny Spain, but we also work with platforms and vendors from all around the world to bring you the best products. 

We mainly work with American vendors with servers all around the globe and mostly in Europe, which privacy rules are applicable to us due to our seat in Spain. However it’s also possible that personal data processing is carried out in other countries where our suppliers operate, including the United Kingdom, for example. In these instances, the processors involved are responsible for ensuring that your data is protected.

For EEA residents, please note that our international transfers outside the EEA either rely on the European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses which we sign with every vendor or the European Commission’s Adequacy Decisions on specific countries. In short, we make sure everything meets the GDPR’s standards, so your data is always in good hands.

In any case the data transfers that may be carried out will be those necessary to operate and supply the applications, products and services described for the indicated purposes. By using our applications, products and services, you acknowledge and agree that your data will be processed outside your country of residence.

**How we protect your information**

We take your privacy very seriously. We are committed to keeping your personal data safe and have all the necessary security measures in place, like top-notch admin, technical, and physical safeguards. We stay up to date with the latest technology to make sure your data doesn’t get messed with, lost, or accessed without permission.

That being said, although we do everything we can to protect your information, no security system is 100% foolproof. So, in the unlikely event that there is a breach or unauthorised access, Voicemod will not be liable. But rest assured, anyone working with Voicemod who needs access to your data is required to follow strict regulations to keep it safe. We don’t mess around with our users and their rights.

Keep in mind, sometimes our website or products may have links to third-party sites. These sites have their own policies in place, so it’s always a good idea to check out their terms, privacy policies, and cookie information before using their services. We do our best to pick trustworthy partners, but we can’t control how they handle your information.

**Minors**

Voicemod can only be used if you are at least 16 years old. If you are 16 years old or older but not of legal age, please ask your parents or legal guardian to read this policy with you as they also accept this together with the Terms of Use. They are responsible for your use of Voicemod Products. We´ve drafted this policy as clearly as possible so that it can be easily understood by anyone, but If you have any question or consider that any clause or term is not sufficiently clear to you, contact us or/and your legal guardian to get clarification.  

**How to control your privacy** 

Below is a list of rights that you may exercise to control your privacy. They come from the EU General Regulation on Data Protection (GDPR) and, because we are a people first company, we want to apply it to you even if you are not in the EU, since they are the most protective and comprehensive rights we know of. 

Being that said, here’s information about your rights as per the GDPR and how you can exercise them: 

* * **Access your data**. You have the right to access and check your data, which you can easily do in the “my account-profile” section.
    * **Correct your data**. We want to make sure your information is accurate and up to date, which is why you’re free to correct or request a change to any of your data.
    * **Delete your data**. If you no longer want us to hold your data, you have the right to request its deletion.
    * **Limit data processing**. You can ask us to limit the processing of your data if you believe it’s being handled inappropriately.
    * **Object to data processing**. If we’re processing your data based on our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to it.
    * **Withdraw consent**. If you previously gave us consent to process your data, you can withdraw that consent at any time.
    * **Data portability**. If we’re processing your data based on your consent or the execution of a contract, you can request a copy of your data in a portable format.
    * **No automated decisions**. You have the right to not be subjected to automated decision-making that could significantly affect you.

* **To file a complaint before the relevant supervisory authority.** If you’d have grounds to believe that any of your rights have not been properly fulfilled you can file a complaint before the relevant supervisory authority in your country.

These rights are important, and we’re here to ensure that you can exercise them easily. To do so or if you have questions, please reach out to us using this [Contact Form](https://www.voicemod.net/en/support/?letstalk=Legal%20Terms+%26+Privacy).
