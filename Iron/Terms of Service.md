Terms & Conditions
------------------

Last updated: 01/01/2024

As a user of Iron.io, you agree to the following terms and conditions and any policies or amendments that may be presented to you from time to time (collectively, the “Terms”).

**Use of Iron.io Services**

Bronze.io Dba Iron.io, Inc. (“Iron.io” or the “Company”) provides cloud application services to you in the form of IronMQ, IronWorker, IronCache, and other services that may from time to time be offered (“Iron.io Services”), provided that you are of legal age and standing to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. In order to access Iron.io Services, you may be required to provide current and accurate identification, including a valid email address, and other information as part of the registration process and/or use of Iron.io Services. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account and password, and are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. Iron.io cannot and will not be liable for your failure to comply with this security obligation.

**Appropriate Conduct**

You agree that you are responsible for the conduct of the messaging, task processing, data caching, and other service activity that you manage, run, and/or operate through or via the use of Iron.io Services and such conduct shall be only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with the provisions of these Terms and the Iron.io Applicable Use Policy, which is included herein by reference. You agree to immediately discontinue any use of Iron.io Services that violates the Applicable Use Policy. Iron.io reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to take actions necessary to discontinue, disable, or otherwise take-down any use of Iron.io Services that do not adhere to the Applicable Use Policy. You agree to take appropriate measures to protect access to any sensitive data transmitted to or processed within Iron.io Services by taking appropriate measure that include making use of SSL endpoints, authenticating outbound traffic from Iron.io Services to your systems, whitelisting of IP addresses ranges (where available), ensuring messages and data payloads are encrypted in transit and at rest, and limiting data retention within the Iron.io Services. You further acknowledge that you are solely responsible for maintaining and backing up any data, code, or applications that Iron.io Services may access or interact with. You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts Iron.io Services or servers or networks connected to Iron.io Services and that you will access Iron.io Services only through the interfaces and commands generally made available by Iron.io, unless otherwise provided for under a separate agreement. Users outside of the United States agree to comply with their own local rules regarding online conduct, including laws regulating the export of data to and from the United States or your country of residence.

**Billing Policies**

A valid credit card is required for paying accounts (and may be required for additional trial resources). Billing for Iron.io services will be on a monthly basis unless otherwise noted on the Pricing page for Iron.io Services or as described in a separate Order Form (as in the case of Professional Plans or above). All payments are non-refundable.

* Monthly-based subscriptions plans will be billed at the time of sign-up and then prior to each month. Any upgrade in plan level will be charged at the new rate in the month in which the change is made. (Pro-rata discounts shall be applied on an approximate basis if a plan is selected after the first week of the month for that month.)
* Any downgrade in plan level will be charged at the new rate for the month following the date of the plan change.
* Resource usage that extends beyond the plan amount will be billed at “pay as you go rates” on a usage-based basis. Additional resource rates are listed on the Pricing page for each service. Note that you can limit Iron.io Services usage to a plan amount on a service-by-service basis via settings in the Plans section of your account page.
* Resource usage above plan amounts will be factored into the most current plan at the time of billing. (By way of explanation, any resource amounts over plan under a lower plan will be wrapped into the resource amounts for an upgraded plan if selected by the end of the month.)
* Downgrading a subscription plan may cause the loss of features or diminished capacity of your account. Iron.io does not accept any liability for such loss.
* Self-service shared instance plans that have selected to have an “annual contract” monthly fee agree to a minimum of 12 months of service at the selected level, unless they choose to upgrade.
* All dedicated plans shall be billed on an annual basis unless agreed to otherwise by the parties and indicated in a separate Order Form.
* Usage-based plans, if offered, will be billed by resource usage as applicable for each Service. Charges are solely based on Iron.io’s measurements of your usage, unless otherwise agreed to in writing.
* All fees are exclusive of all taxes (including, without limitation, sales and use taxes), levies or duties imposed by any national, federal, state or local taxing authorities other than United States (federal or state) net income taxes (collectively, “Taxes”). You shall be responsible for payment of all such Taxes, if any, and shall either by being billed for such Taxes at the time of monthly billing, or reimbursing Iron.io for the full amount of Taxes required to be paid by Iron.io within 30 days after receipt of an invoice therefore.
* Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Iron.io reserves the right to suspend the provision of Iron.io Services to you for any late payments. You are responsible for paying all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Iron.io incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge has been attempted (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights) and (2) refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Iron.io and shall be in the form of credit for Iron.io Services.
* Iron.io may change its fees and payment policies for Iron.io Services at any time. In the event such changes might have a monetary effect on paying customers, Iron.io will notify affected customers at least thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website for Iron.io Services.
