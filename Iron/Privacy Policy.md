Last updated: 01/01/2024

Bronze.io Dba Iron.io, Inc. (“Iron.io” or the “Company”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Statement describes Iron.io’s Web site privacy practices.

**Web Site Covered**

This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of http://iron.io.

**Information Collected**

Iron.io offers a variety of services that are collectively referred to as the “Services.” Iron.io collects information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web site (“Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Services (“Customers”).

When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, Iron.io requires you to provide the Company with personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address (“Required Contact Information”). When purchasing the Services, Iron.io requires you to provide the Company with financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, and credit card number (“Billing Information”). Iron.io may also ask you to provide additional information, such as industry, company revenues, or number of employees (“Optional Information”). Required Contact Information, Billing Information, and Optional Information are referred to collectively as “Data About Iron.io Customers.”

As you navigate the Company’s Web site, Iron.io may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the Company’s Web site (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked).

**Use of Information Collected**

The Company uses Data About Iron.io Customers to perform the services requested.

For example, if you fill out a “Contact Me” Web form, the Company will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services. Iron.io uses Contact Information for account access, service notifications, and other purposes related to use of the Services. Iron.io uses credit card information solely to check the financial qualifications of prospective Customers and to collect payment for the Services. The Company may also use Data About Iron.io Customers for marketing purposes. For example, the Company may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding the Company and its partners, such as information about promotions or events. Iron.io uses Web Site Navigational Information to operate and improve the Company’s Web site. The Company may also use Web Site Navigational Information alone or in combination with Data About Iron.io Customers to provide personalized information about the Company.

**Web Site Navigational Information**

Iron.io uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web site (“Web Site Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information that may be collected on the Company’s Web site and how this information may be used.

**4.1 Cookies**

Iron.io uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Company’s Web site, Iron.io’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Iron.io, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” or other Web forms that may be displayed), you remain anonymous to the Company. Iron.io uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.

If you have chosen to identify yourself to Iron.io, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services.

Iron.io uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web site. When you purchase the Services or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web site, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.

Iron.io may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Iron.io Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.

**4.2 Web Beacons**

Iron.io uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web site and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, Iron.io may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web site. Iron.io uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web site and email communications.

Iron.io may use information from Web beacons in combination with Data About Iron.io Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.

**4.3 IP Addresses**

From time-to-time, Iron.io engages third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web site. Iron.io may also use other third-party cookies to track the performance of Company advertisements.

Iron.io may also contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other Web Site Navigational Information on the Company’s Web site and emails and on third-party Web sites.

Iron.io may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s Web site directly or via third-party services. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Iron.io is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.

Customers and Visitors may elect to use the Company’s referral program to inform friends about the Company’s Web site. When using the referral program, the Company requests the friend’s name and email address.

Iron.io does not control our business partners’ use of the Data About Iron.io Customers we collect, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.

Iron.io uses a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on the Company’s behalf.
