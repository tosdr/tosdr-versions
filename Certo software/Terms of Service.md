### **SECTION 18 – ENTIRE AGREEMENT**

It is your responsibility to check our website periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to our website or the Service following the posting of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.

### **SECTION 21 – RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL**

Customers within the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the UK have a statutory right to withdraw from a contract or subscription within 14 calendar days of the date the order is confirmed. The right applies when you purchase a subscription for digital content from Certo Software. If eligible and want to exercise this right, you must inform us of your decision within 14 calendar days of the date the order is confirmed.

Please note that you will not be able to exercise your withdrawal right if you have started the download of any purchased software and you therefore acknowledge that as a result you waive your automatic statutory right of withdrawal.

### **SECTION 22 – SUBSCRIPTIONS & RENEWALS**

To ensure you are continually protected, we’ll automatically bill you for certain software products from the date you submit your initial payment and at the end of each renewal period thereafter until cancellation. Your renewal period will be equal in time to the renewal period of your current subscription. For example, if you’re on a yearly subscription plan, each billable renewal period will be for one (1) year. We’ll automatically charge you the applicable amount using the payment method given when starting your subscription and by agreeing to these Terms of Service, you authorize us to do this. We’ll let you know in advance if you’re purchasing a software product that includes auto-renewal payments. You can disable auto-renewal by cancelling your subscription at any time via your Certo account or your mobile app store provider.

### **SECTION 23 – REFUND POLICY**

At Certo Software, we value our customers and we work hard to ensure that our products are as good as they can be. The vast majority of our customers are extremely happy with their purchase and we hope you will be too. But if there is a problem and you would like to request a refund, here’s all the information you need:

**30-Day Money-back Guarantee**

We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase of our software products. If you’re not satisfied, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.

If you’re unhappy with your purchase for any reason, you can request a full refund within 30 days of your purchase date. To initiate a refund, please complete the [Refund Form](https://www.certosoftware.com/request-refund/) with your order details and reason for the refund request.

We’ll process your refund within 3 business days of receiving your request. Your refund will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase.

Certo Software does not normally offer refunds for products if more than 30 days have passed since purchase.

Please note that this refund policy only applies to software products sold directly by our company. If you purchased our products from a third-party retailer, please refer to their return policy.

We reserve the right to refuse a refund if we determine that the software has been used in violation of our terms of service or if the refund request is fraudulent.

Thank you for considering our software products. We strive to provide high-quality products and excellent customer service.

**Refund Processing Time**

After a refund has been approved, the payment will take the following amount of time to return to your account:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Payment Method** | **Time** |
| PayPal | 7 – 10 working days |
| Credit Card | 5 – 10 working days |
| Google Play Store | See “How long refunds take” on Google’s website:  <br>[https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637) |

**Chargebacks**

On receipt of a chargeback or payment dispute from a customer’s financial institution we reserve the right to suspend the customer’s service without notice. It is requested that customers contact us to resolve any issues before initiating a chargeback. Dishonestly requesting a chargeback for a valid charge is fraud, and is never an appropriate or legal means of obtaining a refund. All chargebacks will be fully investigated and where appropriate Certo Software will provide information we hold about the transaction to the relevant financial institutions. Please read and make sure you fully understand our refund policy prior to making a payment.

### **SECTION 24 – CERTO ANTISPY SOFTWARE LICENSING**

All versions of Certo AntiSpy sold via our website are accompanied by a software license. Depending on which product you have purchased, this license may impose certain restrictions on the way you use the software and you are prohibited from using the software in any way or for any purpose that violates these restrictions. The terms and restrictions of each software product are described fully on our website and in these Terms of Service. The current license restrictions are as follows:

* All of our software licenses can be activated a maximum of 3 times. A license is activated after successfully installing the software on a computer and inputting your unique license key.
* Customers who have purchased a Certo AntiSpy license are limited to scanning three different devices per license. These three devices may be scanned an unlimited number of times during the license period. Customers who have purchased a Certo AntiSpy Max license may scan an unlimited number of devices an unlimited number of times during the license period.

### **SECTION 25 – MALWARE DETECTION CAPABILITIES**

Certo’s applications are able to detect infections by analyzing the device for known malware signatures. Please note however that they cannot prevent malware infections from occurring.

While every effort is taken to ensure Certo’s products are as accurate as possible, a completed scan with no detections does not guarantee that your device is free from malware. As with any anti-malware tool, we cannot guarantee to detect 100% of malware all of the time, due to new threats emerging constantly. However, we are continually monitoring for new threats and add them to our database as soon as possible.

The malware detection engines built into our apps are very sensitive to allow us to detect a wide range of threats as well as remnants from attacks that have happened in the past. This means that on rare occasions false positives can occur. At Certo, we are happy to investigate any positive detections for our customers and provide further information on any detections.

The results of the scan are for informational purposes only and are not intended to be used as evidence in legal proceedings. Any detection may need to be verified by a digital forensics examiner in this instance.

### **SECTION 26 – CONTACT INFORMATION**

Questions about the Terms of Service should be sent to us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.certosoftware.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
