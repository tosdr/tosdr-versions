Support and Communications Policy
---------------------------------

Customers who require technical support can contact us at any time via the help centre ([help.radio.co](https://help.radio.co/en/)).

### General Support terms

Attempting to seek support via any other channel such as the Website sales chat system or sales email may delay or prevent any response from the support team. We aim to respond to support queries within 24 hours of submission. We often respond much sooner than this. However, our standard products do not include any form of support time response guarantee unless otherwise specified.

Corporate customers who require a dedicated account manager, or guaranteed response times should contact us to arrange a premium service level agreement. We regret that we are unable to provide technical support via other lines of communication such as telephone to clients on our standard support agreement. This is enforced due to the nature of our business and to ensure a fair level of service to the large number of customers who we serve.

To aid our customer service representatives, it is important for clients to include a clear outline of account information, system reference numbers and adequate details of any problems when submitting a request to our support department, with a detailed description and screenshots where required. Failure to do so will result in a delayed response and/or resolution times.

Clients are expected to be courteous and professional in their communications to Radio.co. Under no circumstances will we tolerate any kind of verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse, retribution or ticket desk spamming) of any Radio.co customer, employee, member, or officer will result in immediate account termination.

Radio.co agrees to offer support to clients only on topics directly relating to our services and our technical support team are there to assist clients with any problems directly relating to the availability or functionality of our service. Our support service does not cover generic computer, equipment or website advice. We always try to help clients as much as possible, however, it is important for clients to acknowledge that their hardware/software setup is unique and it is not always possible for our support technicians to offer 100% resolution of all problems. In these cases we will attempt to offer 'Best Effort' support. Clients are expected to do their own research and seek training on such matters. We do not offer support for third-party services. Clients will need to seek advise from the third-party vendor.

Any views, information or opinions presented in any communication from a Radio.co staff member are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of the company.

Our 'Plan' support levels are detailed below. We may change our support policy at any time.

### Basic Support (Lite Plan)

The Lite plan includes self-service support only. You can find our help guides at [help.radio.co](https://help.radio.co/en/)

### Standard Support (Standard & Plus Plan)

Use of the help centre and access to the support team via email and messenger regarding issues directly related to Radio.co services and features. There is no limit to the number of tickets you can send. Please note, the in-app messenger is not a live chat service.

### Enhanced Support (Premium Plan)

Access to the support options above plus you can schedule a call with one of the technical support representatives.

### Telephone Support Terms

We offer telephone support for clients who may be finding it difficult to set up their station, or have many questions which can be answered more effectively in a call.

For smaller queries, or troubleshooting which may require investigation, we advise you to contact support via live chat or email as this method of communication will be more effective.

Our plans offer the following monthly call allowances:

* **Plus**: 2 calls per calendar month
* **Premium**: 4 calls per calendar month

Additional calls may be honored at the discretion of our support team. Telephone support can only be provided if you have scheduled a call. You can request a call back by contacting support at [help.radio.co](https://help.radio.co/en/). Telephone support is provided on a first come, first served basis, subject to availability.

We can provide support by either telephone or Google Meet.

Support calls are allocated 15 minute time slots. Our technical support representatives may not exceed the allocated time. This is to keep telephone support availability as open as possible for all clients who are offered this service.  

Our support team can only advise on issues directly relating to your Radio.co account or any third party services offered by Radio.co.

### Sales Chat

Sales chat is available during standard office hours. This is designed for quick questions and sales queries only. If a client requires support they should use the official methods stated above. Our sales chat operators will not tolerate abuse or profanity. If used we reserve the right to evaluate the status of your services with us (if applicable) which could result in account suspension.

In all cases, Radio.co and its suppliers and distributors will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.

We recognise that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumers’ legal rights which may not be waived by contract.

About These Terms
-----------------

We may modify these terms or any service specific terms, for example, to reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retrospectively and will become effective no earlier than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.

If there is any inconsistency between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

Any charges laid out in these terms are presented in US Dollars ($). If your subscription is billed in any other currency we will use the current day's exchange rate to process any charges due.

These terms govern the relationship between Radio.co and you. They do not create any third-party beneficiary rights.

If you do not comply with these terms and we do not take action immediately, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
