Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms of Use, no default, delay or failure to perform on the part of 32nd Degree shall be considered a breach of these Terms of Use if such default, delay or failure to perform is shown to be due to causes beyond the reasonable control of 32nd Degree.

The section headings used herein, including descriptive headings, are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of these Terms of Use.
