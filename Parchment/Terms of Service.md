Unless you have agreed to a specific contract term with Parchment, you may terminate your Registered User account at any time for any reason by sending an email to Parchment through the contact form requesting such termination. You agree that Parchment, in its sole discretion and without notice or liability to you or any third party, may terminate your Registered User account if Parchment believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with any term of this Agreement. Termination of this Agreement will not relieve you of any liabilities or obligations accrued on or before the date of termination, or limit any other remedies available to Parchment arising out of your breach of this Agreement.

### 16\. General information

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Parchment, superseding any prior agreements between you and Parchment. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the County of Maricopa, Arizona. The failure of Parchment to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. These Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Parchment’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.

The communications between you and Parchment use electronic means, whether you visit the Site or send Parchment e-mails, or whether Parchment posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from Parchment in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Parchment provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights.

You hereby release the Parchment and its employees, agents, officers, and directors and their successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises from any interactions with or conduct of other Site users or third party websites of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of your these Terms or your use of the Site or the Services. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.

Parchment shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.

Where Parchment requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Parchment with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Parchment is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by these Terms, Parchment’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Parchment at the following address: © 2024 Parchment, an Instructure company, 7001 N. Scottsdale Rd., Suite 1050 Scottsdale, AZ 85253, Attn: General Counsel. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Parchment by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.

This Site can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to services and Content that are not available in your country. These references do not imply that Parchment intends to announce such services or Content in your country. The Site and Services are controlled and offered by Parchment from its facilities in the United States of America. Parchment makes no representations that the Site or the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Site or the Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.

You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Intellectual Property except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Intellectual Property, and any other applicable laws.

### 17\. Arbitration

Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Agreement. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English; (3) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (4) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parchment may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. Please note that the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from Arizona law, including the laws governing what can legally be sold, bought, exported, offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that re applicable to your use of the Site and the Services.

Any other Dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitratable) shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”) and shall be administered by the Phoenix, Arizona office of the American Arbitration Association (the “Administrator”). To the extent there is any conflict between the provisions set forth in this section and any procedural or other rules issued by the Administrator, this section will control. The location of the arbitration will be Phoenix, Arizona USA. The Dispute(s) shall be submitted to a single arbitrator (“Arbitrator”) chosen by the parties or selected by the parties from a list of potential arbitrators provided by the Administrator. The Administrator shall provide such list to the parties 10 days after request by either party. Should the parties be unable to agree on a choice of arbitrator within 10 days after receipt of the list from the Administrator, then the Administrator will select the Arbitrator. The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English will be submitted in English translation accompanied by the original or true copy thereof. The English language version will control. Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees, costs, and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the Administrator and the Arbitrator; provided, however, the Arbitrator shall be authorized to determine whether a party is the prevailing party, and if so, to award to that prevailing party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges, travel expenses, etc.), and/or the fees and costs of the Administrator and the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The Arbitrator will not have authority to award damages in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 9 of this Agreement. Judgment on the award of the Arbitrators may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by Arizona law or United States Federal law.

By using the Site or the Services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration provision. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and Parchment (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
