Matomo Cloud Terms of Service
=============================

**Note: The following Terms of Service apply to Matomo Cloud only and not to Matomo On-Premise which would be hosted on your own servers and therefore the Terms of Service isn’t needed.**

[Account Terms](#account-terms)  
[API Terms](#api)  
[Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms](#payment)  
[Cancellation and Termination](#cancellation)  
[Modifications to the Service and Prices](#modification)  
[Copyright and Content Ownership](#copyright)  
[Privacy and security of your data](#privacy)  
[General Conditions](#general)

  
By using the Matomo Analytics Cloud (“Service”) provided by InnoCraft (“Company”), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Service”). If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use this Service. By accepting these Terms of Service below or by using the Service in any manner, you and the entity you represent (“Customer”) agree that you have read and agree to be bound by this agreement to the exclusion of all other terms. Violation of any of the terms below may result in the termination of your account.

Account Terms
-------------

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

1. You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have their own logins under your account).
2. You may not use the Service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.
3. You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.
4. Your login may only be used by one person – a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted.
5. You may create separate logins for other people according to your Service plan. Any separate login or person will be automatically bound to these Terms of Service and it is your responsibility to inform your users about these Terms of Service.
6. You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.

API Terms
---------

Customers may access their Service data via the Application Program Interface (“API”). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses the Service, is bound by the terms of this agreement plus the following specific terms:

1. You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.
2. Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Service via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. The Company will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.

Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms
-------------------------------------------------

1. Customer is billed automatically via credit card, PayPal, or invoiced for payment, depending on the Service plan.
2. The number of Hits purchased by Customer in the Service plan must be used during the applicable term and any unused Hits at the end of such term are forfeited. For a Service plan purchased for a yearly term, the Hits can be used anytime during the year and the number of available Hits is twelve times the number of Hits in a month for the selected Service plan.
3. In the event the usage of Hits exceeds the Service plan you selected during a term, the Company will charge additional overage fees and the Customer shall be obligated to pay any overage fees in the next term. The overage fees are displayed in your Account page in Matomo and on the pricing page at [matomo.org/pricing](https://matomo.org/pricing/).
4. A Hit is defined as the total number of hits which is the sum of all Page views, Downloads, Outlinks, Events, Site searches, Content impressions and Content interactions.
5. Upgrade or downgrade in the Service plan level will result in the new rate being charged at the next billing cycle.
6. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of features or capacity of your account. The Company does not accept any liability for such loss.
7. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties. Where required, The Company will collect those taxes on behalf of taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities.
8. Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable.
9. In the event Customer utilizes a third party system as part of its utilization of the Service, such as the SMS notifications, the Company reserves the right to pass through its costs of such service to Customer, and Customer agrees to pay such fees.
10. Our online order process is conducted by our reseller [Paddle.com](https://paddle.com/). Paddle.com is the Merchant of Record for most of our orders. Paddle provides customer service inquiries and handles returns.

Cancellation and Termination
----------------------------

1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on the Account link in Administration area of Matomo. The Account screen provides a cancellation link.
2. Upon the effective cancellation date of your subscription, all of your data will become inaccessible from the Service immediately. All of your Matomo data will be deleted within 30 days from this date, except for residual account information, which may be retained in our backup and logs for up to an additional 30 days. This information cannot be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.
3. If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be charged again. But there will not be any prorating of unused time in the last billing cycle.
4. The Company, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. The Company reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

Modifications to the Service and Prices
---------------------------------------

1. The Company reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of the Service with or without notice.
