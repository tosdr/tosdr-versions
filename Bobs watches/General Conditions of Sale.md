**Return Policy**
=================

Return Policy
=============

At Bob's Watches, it is our goal to ensure that every customer is 100% satisfied with their purchase. To that end, we offer a "no questions asked" 3 day refund on all purchases subject to the following conditions. Products that have been worn, altered or damaged will not be accepted for a full refund. Any pre-owned watch may be returned provided the watch is in the exact same condition as it was sold and includes all the boxes, papers, books and accessories. Please inform one of our representatives of your intention to return the watch before you ship the merchandise. All return shipments must be post marked before the 3rd calendar day from receipt of your watch and are sent at your sole cost and expense. Please be sure to insure the contents for their full value as we are not responsible for lost packages. Upon receipt, all items will undergo a thorough inspection by one of our watch experts to ensure that the watch is in the original condition in which it was sold and it includes all tags (especially any "non-removable" tags), items/accessories, etc before we will issue a refund. Upon completion of the inspection we will refund the purchase price less any return shipping and insurance fees paid by Bob's Watches and any transaction fees (i.e. credit card, Amazon, financing or PayPal fees).  This return policy is for on-line sales only: all in-store sales and International sales are final.

Rolex Factory Stickered Watches
-------------------------------

These items are being sold in unused/unworn condition and come with the original Rolex factory stickers. Removing these factory stickers will significantly impact the value and resalability of this watch. Therefore, these stickers must not be removed in-order-to be eligible for a full refund. Any watches returned with these factory stickers removed will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, but could decrease the refund by as much as 20% of the purchase price.

Holiday Policy
--------------

During the holiday season Bob's is offering an extended return policy for exchange only. There are no cash refunds for this extended period. Any watch purchased between Black Friday and December 25th may be exchanged for any item through December 31st. We must receive the returned item by December 31. Merchandise purchased after December 25th, or merchandise that is returned within 3 days of receipt, falls under Bob's standard non-holiday return policy.
