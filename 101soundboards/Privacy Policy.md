Help
====

##### How can I download sounds?

To download a sound, right click on the sound and press 'download sound'. You can get free download credits by waching an advert.

##### Why are there adverts?

Advertising helps support this free site. It costs money in hosting, and a lot of time and effort making and maintaining the site.

We've tried many different ways over the years to fund this site, including charging for downloads, donations, selling merchandise and stickers, but there was little to no support.

##### Why is my AdBlocker stopping downloads?

Ask your AdBlocker to stop blocking downloads.

##### How do I make a sound into a ringtone?

Download the MP3 sound (see above for instructions), and then follow [this guide for iOS](https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/apple/custom-ringtone-iphone-3622959/) or this [guide for Android](https://www.androidauthority.com/set-own-music-mp3-custom-notification-ringtone-166052/).

##### Do you have a smartphone or desktop app?

We have smartphone apps available for Android and iOS available on the [Apps page](https://www.101soundboards.com/pages/app).

If you have Google Chrome for desktop, you can also install 101soundboards. Just go to the menu in the top right (three dots) and press 'Install 101soundboards'.

##### Why soundboards?

Read about the unexpected benefits of soundboards on the [Have Fun Playing Sounds](https://www.101soundboards.com/pages/have-fun-playing-sounds) page.

##### Can I use my keyboard to play sounds?

Yes! You can use the keyboard to play sounds. Just press the key that corresponds to the sound you want to play. You can see the key on the top left of sound buttons.

##### How can I create a soundboard?

To make a soundboard, create an account, go to [My Soundboards](https://www.101soundboards.com/home), press 'Add New Board,' name your board, then upload sound files. Press 'Request Transcription' and within a few minutes your sounds will be automatically labelled using Speech to Text, or label them yourself.

##### How do I edit sound files?

These are three ways you can edit sound files:

1. Use the free software '[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)' (recommended) which you can [download for free](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/), to edit your files before you upload them.
2. Use the [online audio editor](https://www.101soundboards.com/pages/editor) to edit your files before you upload them.
3. Trim your sounds after you upload them by pressing the icon next to the sound on your soundboard.

##### Can I make my own Favorites soundboard and share it with my friends?

Yes you can. Sign up or log in to your account. Right-click any sound on any soundboard and press 'Add to Favorites.' Then find your public favorites soundboard on the [favorites soundboards list](https://www.101soundboards.com/favorites). The newest ones are at the end of the list.

##### What file format do my sounds need to be?

You can upload files in any format, including MP3, WAV, OGG, MKV and MP4. They will be automatically converted.

##### What is Text-to-Speech?

Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a technology that converts text into spoken voice output. It is used in a variety of applications, including voice assistants, navigation systems, and accessibility tools for people with visual impairments. On 101soundboards you can use TTS to create custom sounds various voices, then share them with others. TTS voices are synthetic creations and do not imply any affiliation with the person whose name or likeness may be associated with it.

##### How does the TTS feature work on this site?

When you submit a phrase to be converted into speech, our system sends the text to a TTS engine, which generates an audio file of the spoken text. The audio file is then added to the soundboard for you to play and share with others.

To use the TTS feature, simply enter your desired phrase in the text box on the voice of your choice. Click the "Generate" button to create your custom sound. The TTS engine will process your request and generate an audio file of the spoken text, which will be added to the top of the soundboard in green for you to play and share with others.

You can find a list of available voices and song generators on the [TTS page](https://www.101soundboards.com/tts). Explore a variety of voices and create unique sounds to share with your friends.

##### Why does it take time for my TTS request to be processed?

The time it takes for your TTS request to be processed depends on the current queue size and the TTS engine being used. Some voices have no queue and are processed immediately, while others may take a few minutes to generate the audio file.

##### What should I do while waiting for my TTS request to be processed?

If there is a queue, while waiting for your TTS request to be processed you can bookmark the page and check back later. You can also explore other voices and song generators on the site to create more sounds, or explore the millions of sounds already available on 101soundboards.

##### Can I queue multiple sounds for generation at the same time?

Yes, you can queue multiple sounds for generation at the same time. Each sound will be processed in the order it was submitted, and you can check the status of each request on the soundboard.

##### What happens if my TTS request contains inappropriate content?

Phrases with extreme inappropriate language, hate speech, self-harm, violence, or bullying may be blocked and not displayed on the soundboard. Please keep your requests fun, friendly, and respectful.

##### How do I delete a TTS sound I created?

To delete a TTS sound you created, go to [Manage TTS Phrases](https://www.101soundboards.com/tts/me) where you can view the TTS phrases you have created.

Alternatively, if you have found an offensive sound, right click on the sound (press and hold on mobile) and select "Report" from the context menu. We typically investigate reports within a few minutes. Alternatively you can use the contact form, and include a link to the sound.

##### Where can I find more voices and song generators?

You can find more voices and song generators on the [TTS Voices List](https://www.101soundboards.com/tts). Explore a variety of voices and create unique sounds to share with your friends.

##### Why did another similar sound get generated?

Sometimes we use AI to generate a phrase in the style of the character or voice you requested. This is a bonus and can be fun to explore.

##### How can I learn more about the TTS feature?

If you have more questions about the TTS feature or need help with a specific request, please contact us through the [contact page](https://www.101soundboards.com/pages/contact). We are here to help you create awesome sounds!

##### Can I create my own TTS voice from a custom recording?

While we would love to offer custom TTS voices from custom recordings, this feature is not currently available on the site due to the prohibitive cost. However, we are always looking for ways to improve the TTS feature and add new voices and features. If you have a suggestion or request, please contact us through the [contact page](https://www.101soundboards.com/pages/contact). We appreciate your feedback!

##### Downloading a sound with the app failed

Please try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. There are frequent updates, and it is the easiest way to clear your cache and reset the app. Alternatively you can just download the sound from the web site.

##### I want to play lots of sounds at the same time

At the footer of the page, there is a button that can be switched between '1-Shot' and 'Multiplay' modes. 'Multiplay' plays multiple sounds at the same time, and 'One Shot' will stop the previous sound when you play a new one.

##### Can I install 101soundboards?

Yes! Just go to the menu in the top right (three dots) and press 'Install 101soundboards' (Google Chrome only).

The colors of the sound buttons change as the initial letter of the sound title changes. This is to help you navigate through a soundboard, instead of a wall of identical buttons.

##### How can I get support with autism?

We recognize that many of our users are autistic. Here is a great [list of resources for Autism awareness and support](https://autismawarenesscentre.com/resource-regions/united-states/).

##### How do I hide the banner adverts?
