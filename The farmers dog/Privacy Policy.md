* **Professional or Employment Related Information**, including details about your current or past employment, job title, employer, and employment history. This information may be gathered through surveys, questionnaires, or other interactions for consumer research purposes.

* **Geolocation Data**. We collect non-specific geolocation data to provide you with our products and services and to better tailor our products and services to you depending on your geographic region.
* **Profile Information**, such as information about your preferences and characteristics. We collect this information to understand your preferences and tailor our products and services and communications to you. We do not disclose this information to third parties unless we are required to do so.

Some of the information we collect may be considered **Sensitive Personal Information** under privacy laws, such as your financial information or user log in information.

We do not sell your Sensitive Personal Information.

We may collect Personal Information directly from you, automatically through our use of cookies and other data collection technologies on our website, and from third parties (such as friends and family that may refer you). We may also permit third party advertisers to collect information about you when you visit our website.

How We Use Personal Information
-------------------------------

In addition to the purposes for collection described above, we also collect each category of Personal Information for the purpose of maintaining our relationship with you and performing services, which include:

Browser Signals
---------------

### Do Not Track

Some web browsers have “Do Not Track” or similar features that communicate to each website you visit that you do not want your activities on that website tracked. At present, our website does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals and so our website will continue to collect information about you even if your browser’s “Do Not Track” feature is activated.

Data Security & Retention
-------------------------

We are committed to implementing safeguards designed to maintain the privacy and integrity of your Personal Information. We also rely on you for the safety and security of your information. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via digital means is not completely secure. Although we implement and maintain reasonable measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of the information transmitted to us; therefore, we do not assume any responsibility for any transmission of your information which you do at your own risk. We retain your Personal Information for as long as needed to fulfill the business purpose(s) for which we collected it. We also take into consideration the sensitivity of the data when determining its retention period.

Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information
-------------------------------------------------

If you have registered for our services, you may be able to access, review, and make changes to information associated with your account by logging into your account and taking the desired actions. We may not be able to accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

Submitting a Privacy Rights Request
-----------------------------------

Depending on where you reside, you may exercise your rights free of charge (subject to limited exceptions). To exercise your rights, contact us at [(888) 814-4162](tel:+18888144162) or use our online form [here](https://preferences.thefarmersdog.com/privacy).

Where required by applicable law, we will take steps to verify your identity before processing your request. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the individual about whom we collected Personal Information. We may request additional information about you so that we can match the information you provide to information we already maintain about you. We will only use the Personal Information provided in the verification process to verify your identity or authority to make a request and to track and document request responses unless you initially provided the information for another purpose.

You may use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete. When we verify your agent’s request, we may verify both your and your agent’s identity and request a signed document from you that authorizes your agent to make the request on your behalf. To protect your Personal Information, we reserve the right to deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf.

Voice Calls, Texts, and SMS messages
------------------------------------

You may have the opportunity to receive occasional voice, text, and SMS messages from us. These are typically updates on our products and services or about products and services that we think may be of interest to you. Frequency will vary. By providing your phone number and opting in to receive text messages, you expressly consent to receive these communications, including any automated text messages to the phone number that you provide. Consent to receiving text messages is not required to receive products or services from us. Message and data rates may apply, and your carrier's rates will apply. You can opt out of receiving future text messages or receive help by following the directions in the text message you receive or accessing your customer account at our website. As we are in the United States, international rates may apply depending on your location. We may disclose your mobile phone number to service providers with whom we contract to send you automated text messages. However, we will not disclose your mobile phone number to third parties for their own marketing purposes without your express consent. We may still contact you about your account even if you opt out of calls, texts, or SMS.

Email Consent and Opt-Out
-------------------------

If you do not wish to have your email address used by us to promote our products or services, you can opt-out by managing your communication preferences in your customer account at our website or by clicking the unsubscribe link contained within any promotional email you received. This opt-out does not apply to transactional or relationship email messages we may send.

Our website is not intended for or directed to persons under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or maintain information on our website from those we know are under 16, and we do not permit persons under 16 years of age to become registered users of our website.
