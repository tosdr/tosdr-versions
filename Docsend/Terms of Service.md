Terms of Service
================

Last Modified: July 27, 2021

Posted: July 27, 2021  
Effective: August 26, 2021

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute an agreement between Dropbox, Inc., if you are based in the United States, its territories and possessions, Canada, or Mexico (“North America“) or Dropbox International Unlimited Company if you are based outside North America (each, for the purpose of these Terms, “DocSend,” “us,” “we” or “our”) and the party agreeing to these terms (“Customer,” “you,” or “your”). These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services. By accessing or using the Services, you accept these Terms, acknowledge that you have read and understand these Terms, and agree to be bound by these Terms.  Please note that the Dropbox Terms of Service, Dropbox Business Agreement, the Dropbox Privacy Policy, and any other terms found on the [Dropbox website](https://www.dropbox.com/terms) do not apply to the DocSend Services.

If you are entering into these Terms for use of the Services by an organization, you are agreeing on behalf of that organization. You must have the authority to bind that organization to these terms, otherwise you must not sign up for the Services.

1.       Services.

1.1.   Provision. These Terms govern access to, and use of, the Services, and any associated Software, ordered by Customer through an Order Form. Customer may access and use the Services in accordance with the Terms.

1.2.   Modifications. DocSend may update the Services from time to time. If DocSend changes the Services in a manner that materially reduces their functionality, DocSend will notify Customer at the email address associated with the account, and Customer may provide notice within thirty days of the change to terminate the Terms. This termination right will not apply to updates made to features provided on a beta or evaluation basis.

1.3.   Software.

a.   Generally. Some of the Services may allow Customer and End Users to download Software that may update automatically. DocSend hereby grants to Customer during the Term a limited non-exclusive license to use the Software solely in connection with the Services and in accordance with the Terms. This license is non-transferable (subject to Section 16.2), irrevocable (except as set forth in Section 8), non-sublicensable, and will be fully paid up upon Customer’s payment of the Fees.

b.   Open Source. If any component of the Software is offered under an open source license, DocSend will make the license available to Customer and to the extent the provisions of that license grant Customer additional rights, those provisions will expressly override some provisions of the Terms solely with respect to that component of the Software.

1.4.   Service-Specific Terms. Certain Services, or portions thereof, may be subject to additional terms, including third party terms and conditions, that are specific to the particular Services and are set forth in the Service-Specific Terms. By accessing or using Services covered by any Service-Specific Terms, you agree to the applicable Service-Specific Terms. If there is a conflict between these Terms and the Service-Specific Terms, the Service-Specific Terms will control with respect to the applicable Services or portions thereof. Your use of the Services may also be subject to additional policies, guidelines, or rules we post on the Services or make available to you.

1.5.   Reference Materials. DocSend may make certain reference Materials, including without limitation an NDA, available through the Services. Such Materials are for informational purposes only and DocSend makes no representations or warranties as to their validity, reliability or sufficiency. The Materials, including the NDA, are not intended to (a) constitute legal advice or (b) create an attorney-client relationship. Customer acknowledges and agrees that each situation is highly fact-specific and requires a knowledge of both state and federal laws. Therefore any party should seek legal advice from a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdictions.

1.6.   DocSend Rights. DocSend reserves the right to access Customer’s account as necessary in order to provide the Services.  Further, Customer agrees that we may, but are not required to:  (a) monitor the Services or Customer Data for violations of these Terms and for compliance with our policies; (b) refuse, restrict access to or the availability of, or remove or disable access to the Materials or Customer Data or any portion thereof, without prior notice to Customer, at any time for any reason (including upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to Customer Data), or for no reason at all; (c) report to law enforcement authorities and/or take legal action against anyone who violates these Terms; or (d) manage the Services in a manner designed to protect our and third parties’ rights and property or to facilitate the proper functioning of the Service.

1.7.   Third Party Services and Materials. The Services may contain links to Third Party Services and Third Party Materials. DocSend does not own, or operate these Third Party Services, and we do not endorse any Third Party Services or Third Party Materials.  If Customer accesses or uses any Third Party Services or Third Party Materials: (a) Customer is solely responsible for this access and use; (b) DocSend is not responsible for any act or omission of the third party or the availability, accuracy, the related content, products or services of Third Party Services or Third Party Materials; and (c) these Terms do not apply to the Third Party Services.  Before accessing or using a Third Party Service, you should review the Third Party Service’s terms and conditions, privacy policy, and all of Third Party Service’s other documents, and inform yourself of the terms, policies, and practices of the Third Party Service.

2.      Customer Obligations.

2.1.   Registration. In order to use the Services, Customers and End Users must first register with us through our on-line registration process and authenticate following the authentication protocols provided by Customer. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete, and Customer agrees to keep this information up-to-date. Account information will be governed by DocSend’s Privacy Policy for the applicable Services.

2.2.   End Users.

a.   Provisioning. Customer may provision End User Accounts up to the number of End User Licenses purchased through one or more Order Forms. Each End User Account requires a paid End User License, and End User Accounts may not be shared by multiple individuals.

b.   Additional End Users. The Services may be configured to allow Administrators or End Users to purchase additional End User Licenses. Customer is responsible for understanding the settings and controls of the Services for purchasing End User Licenses and provisioning new End User Accounts. DocSend will charge Customer the applicable pro-rated amount for additional End User Licenses based on Customer’s then-current price unless otherwise set forth on the Order Form.

2.3.   Customer Authentication. Customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the authentication methods they use to access the Services, including their Authentication Credentials. Customer and its End Users may not share the Authentication Credentials or, without DocSend’s permission, give others access to or transfer Customer’s account or any End User Account.

2.4.  Unauthorized Use or Access. Customer will prevent unauthorized use of the Services by its End Users and terminate any unauthorized use of or access to the Services. The Services are not intended for End Users under the age of 13 in the United States or 16 outside of the United States. Customer will ensure that it does not allow any person under 13 within the United States or 16 outside the United States to use the Services. Customer is responsible for any activity using its account, whether or not Customer authorized that activity.  You should immediately notify DocSend in writing of any unauthorized use of your account by sending an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.docsend.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

2.5.   Restrictions. Customer may access and use the Services only for lawful purposes.  Customer will not (and will not allow any third party to): (a) sublicense, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, time share, or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Services, Software, or any End User Licenses available to any third party; (b) use the Services in any unlawful manner (including in violation of any data, privacy or export control laws) or in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Services or its components; (c) modify, adapt or hack the Services to, or otherwise attempt to, gain unauthorized access to the Services or its related systems or networks; (d) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security related features of the Services or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any Materials or enforce limitations on use of Materials; or (e) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code.  Customer will comply with any codes of conduct, policies, or other notices DocSend provides or publishes in connection with the Services, and Customer will promptly notify DocSend if it learns of a security breach related to the Services. Customer agrees not to access the Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by DocSend for accessing the Services, unless otherwise specifically authorized by us in a separate written agreement signed by a DocSend authorized signatory.

2.6.   Acceptable Use.  When using the Services, Customer:  (a) represents and warrants that it owns or has sufficient rights to upload Customer Data on or through the Services; (b) will not copy, upload, download, or share Customer Data unless it has the legal right to do so; (c) will not upload content that violates DocSend’s rights or any third party’s rights, including rights of privacy or publicity, Intellectual Property Rights, or contract rights; (d) will fully comply with any third-party licenses relating to Customer Data, including paying all royalties, fees and any other monies relating to content that is uploaded to the Services; (e) will not upload or submit content that (i) is defamatory, damaging, disruptive, unlawful, inappropriate, offensive, inaccurate, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, profane, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, threatening, violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable; (ii) incites, encourages or threatens physical harm against another, including content that promotes racism, bigotry, sexism, religious intolerance or harm against any group or individual; or (iii) contains material that solicits personal information from anyone under 13 or exploits anyone in a sexual, violent or unlawful manner; (f) will not use the Services for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose including, collecting user names and/or email addresses of other users by electronic or any other means for the purpose of sending unsolicited email or other electronic communications, or engaging in unauthorized framing of, or linking to, the Services without prior express written consent signed by a DocSend authorized signatory; (g) will not upload or submit content that constitutes, contains, installs or attempts to install or promotes spyware, malware or other computer code, whether on DocSend’s or others’ computers or equipment, designated to enable you or others to gather information about or monitor the on-line or other activities of another party; (h) will not transmit chain letters, bulk or junk email or interfere with, disrupt, or create an undue burden on the Services or the networks or systems connected to the Services, including hacking into the Services, or using the Services to send unsolicited or commercial emails, bulletins, comments or other communications; and (i) will not impersonate any other person or entity, provide false or misleading identification, payment or address information, or invade the privacy, or violate the personal or proprietary right, of any person or entity.

3.       Data.

3.1.   Limitations. These Terms constitute Customer’s instructions to DocSend to process Customer Data. DocSend, DocSend personnel and its Subcontractors will only process, access, use, store, and transfer Customer Data as Customer instructs in order to deliver the Services and as specified in these Terms.

3.2.   Backup and Retention. Customer is responsible for retaining and backing up Customer Data. DocSend will not be liable for any loss or corruption of Customer Data, or for any costs or expenses associated with backing up or restoring any Customer Data.  Accordingly, Customer acknowledges that it bears sole responsibility for adequate backup and retention of Customer Data, and that it is Customer’s sole responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection to communicate with the Services if it wishes to protect transmission of data or files to DocSend.  DocSend will have no liability to you for any corruption, deletion, destruction or loss of any of Customer Data.

3.3.   Aggregate/Anonymous Data. DocSend may generate data that has been de-identified, anonymized and aggregated with other de-identified, anonymized data (including from other customers) based on Customer’s use of the Services and use such data for any of the following purposes:  internal research and development; development of tools, methodologies, algorithms and processes; machine learning; risk management; fraud prevention; enhancing products, services and features; developing new products, services and features; and conducting and furthering DocSend’s business.

3.4.   Compliance. Customer is responsible for retaining and storing Customer Data in compliance with applicable law.  If Customer is legally required to retain or store copies of Customer Data, Customer must do so using its own facilities.

3.5.   Data Transfer. DocSend may transfer Customer Data to and access, use, and store Customer Data in locations other than Customer’s country. To the extent Customer Data includes Personal Data that is subject to the CCPA or the GDPR that DocSend is Processing on Customer’s behalf, Customer and DocSend agree to the [DocSend Data Processing Addendum](https://www.docsend.com/customer-dpa/), which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. The terms “CCPA”, “GDPR”, “Personal Data”, and “Processing” will have the meanings defined in the DocSend Data Processing Addendum.

4.       Intellectual Property.

4.1.   Reservation of Rights. Except as set forth herein, these Terms do not grant: (a) DocSend any Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data; or (b) Customer any Intellectual Property Rights in the Services, Materials, or DocSend trademarks and brand features. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and that irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale” or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Customer (or its End Users) under these Terms.

4.2.   Limited Permission. Customer grants DocSend only the limited rights that are reasonably necessary for DocSend to deliver the Services in accordance with these Terms. This limited permission also extends to Subcontractors or Sub-processors.

4.3.   Feedback. Please be aware that we may use any Feedback sent to us in any form or any manner without any obligation to Customer.  By submitting Feedback to us, Customer: (i) assigns to DocSend all of its right, title and interest in and to all such Feedback; and (ii) agrees to provide any reasonable assistance necessary to document and maintain DocSend’s rights in the Feedback.  In the event that such assignment is not valid, Customer agrees and grants to DocSend a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual license to use or incorporate into the Services any Feedback.

5.       Additional Terms for DocSend Signature. Use of DocSend Signature is governed by these Terms, and the Service-Specific Terms set forth in this Section 5.  By using DocSend Signature, Customer agrees to the following:

5.1.   By using DocSend Signature, Customer agrees to do business Electronically and to sign Electronic Records by Electronic Signature.

5.2.   If Customer is using DocSend Signature on behalf of a business, company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind the business or entity to the Electronic Record you send or accept via DocSend Signature.

5.3.   Customer has exclusive control over and responsibility for the content, quality and format of any Electronic Record.  Nothing in these Terms makes DocSend a party to any Electronic Record signed or shared via DocSend Signature.

5.4.   Customer is bound by any Electronic Signature made on its behalf by any person via DocSend Signature.  Customer acknowledges that the use of Electronic Signatures and Electronic Records is governed by foreign, federal and state laws and the laws of other jurisdictions and agrees that it is responsible for complying with all such laws.

5.5.   Electronic Signatures on certain types of Electronic Records may not be valid, enforceable, or have legal effect (e.g., wills or agreements concerning family law).  Customer agrees that it is solely responsible for determining whether Electronic Records signed via DocSend Signature are valid, enforceable, or have legal effect, and we have no such responsibility.  DocSend makes no representations or warranties that Electronic Records signed via DocSend are valid, enforceable, or have legal effect.

5.6.   DocSend Signature is designed for business transactions, not consumer transactions.  Some consumer protection laws may impose special requirements for Electronic Signatures and Electronic Records in connection with consumer transactions.  Consumer transactions generally involve individuals who obtain, through a transaction, products or services which are used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.  These requirements may include providing disclosures and paper copies of Electronic Records.  DocSend Signature does not comply with any of these requirements and other legal requirements.  Customer may not use DocSend Signature in connection with consumer transactions.

5.7.   Customer is responsible for determining how long it is required to retain or store Customer Data in compliance with any applicable law, including any Electronic Records Customer signs or shares via DocSend Signature.  As provided in Section 3.2, any Electronic Records must be stored using Customer’s own facilities, and DocSend is not responsible for continuing to store or retrieve any Electronic Records or for ensuring that third parties receive Electronic Records Customer signs or shares via DocSend Signature.

6.       Pricing and Payment.

6.1.   Fees. Customer will pay DocSend or Customer’s reseller all applicable Fees in the currency and pursuant to the payment terms indicated on the Order Form or in the applicable agreement between Customer and Customer’s reseller. Customer authorizes DocSend, or Customer’s reseller, to charge Customer for all applicable Fees using Customer’s selected payment method, and Customer will issue the required purchasing documentation, if any. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in the Terms.

6.2.   Payment. Customer will pay DocSend invoices on the payment interval set forth in the Order Form. DocSend may suspend or terminate the Services if Fees are past due. Customer will provide complete and accurate billing and contact information to DocSend or to Customer’s reseller.

6.3.   Taxes. Fees are exclusive of taxes and Customer is responsible for all Taxes. DocSend, or Customer’s reseller, will charge Taxes when required to do so. If Customer provides DocSend or its reseller with a valid exemption certificate, DocSend will not collect the taxes covered by that certificate.

6.4.   Withholding Taxes. Customer will pay DocSend or its reseller net of any applicable Withholding Taxes. Customer and DocSend, or Customer’s reseller if applicable, will work together to avoid any Withholding Tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available. If DocSend or Customer’s reseller qualifies for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, DocSend or Customer’s reseller will provide Customer with reasonable documentary proof. Customer will provide DocSend or Customer’s reseller reasonable evidence that it has paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.

6.5.   Auto-renewals and Trials. IF CUSTOMER HAS ALREADY PROVIDED A PAYMENT METHOD TO DOCSEND FOR RECURRING CHARGES AND CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT IS SET TO AUTO-RENEWAL OR IS IN A TRIAL PERIOD, DOCSEND (OR CUSTOMER’S RESELLER) MAY CHARGE AUTOMATICALLY AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR FOR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS CUSTOMER NOTIFIES DOCSEND (OR CUSTOMER’S RESELLER, AS APPLICABLE) THAT CUSTOMER WANTS TO DISABLE AUTO-RENEWAL OR CANCEL THE SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 7.2. DocSend may revise Services rates by providing the Customer at least thirty days’ notice prior to the next charge.

6.6.   Purchase Orders. If Customer requires the use of a purchase order or purchase order number, Customer: (i) must provide the purchase order number at the time of purchase; and (ii) agrees that any terms and conditions on a Customer purchase order will not apply to these Terms and are null and void.

8.4.   Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate the Terms, including all Order Forms, if: (i) the other party is in material breach of the Terms and fails to cure that breach within thirty days after receipt of written notice; or (ii) the other party ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within ninety days.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EXCEPT FOR DOCSEND OR CUSTOMER’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR DOCSEND AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THE TERMS FOR (I) INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR (II) LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, REVENUES, OR PROFITS (IN EACH CASE WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), EVEN IF THE PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.      Compliance.

14.1.   U.S. Government Matters.  Customer may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of the Services or anything related to the Services in violation of any restrictions, laws or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, any other United States agency or authority, or any foreign agency or authority.  As defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) Section 2.101, the software and documentation installed by DocSend on your equipment (if applicable) are “commercial items” and according to Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (“DFAR”) Section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and (5) are deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation.”  Consistent with DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, any use modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such commercial software or commercial software documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms and will be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms.

14.2.   Export Compliance.  Each party must comply with all applicable Export Control Laws in providing and using the Services.  Without limiting the foregoing:  (a) each party represents that it is not named on any U.S. government list of persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports; and (b) Customer must not permit users to access or use the Services in violation of any U.S. export embargo, prohibition or restriction.

15.      Disputes.

15.1.   Informal Resolution. Before filing a claim, each party agrees to try to resolve the dispute by contacting the other party through the notice procedures in Section 15.2. If a dispute is not resolved within sixty days of notice, Customer or DocSend may bring a formal proceeding.

15.2.   Arbitration. Customer and DocSend agree to resolve any claims relating to the Terms or the Services through final and binding individual arbitration, except as set forth below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation or application of this “Arbitration” subsection, including its scope, enforceability, revocability, or validity. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be held in San Francisco (CA), or any other location both parties agree to in writing. The arbitrator may award relief only individually and only to the extent necessary to redress Customer’s or DocSend’s individual claim(s); the arbitrator may not award relief on behalf of others or the general public. Our past, present and future affiliates and agents may invoke our rights under this “Disputes” Section in the event they become involved in a dispute with you; otherwise, these Terms do not give rights to any third parties.

15.3.   Exception to Arbitration. Either party may bring a lawsuit in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights without first engaging in the informal dispute notice process described above. Both Customer and DocSend consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

15.4.   NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS. Customer may only resolve disputes with DocSend on an individual basis and may not bring a claim in a class, consolidated or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.

15.5.   Severability. If any part of this “Disputes” section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this “Disputes” section will be unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according to this “Disputes” section, then only that respective claim or request for relief may be brought in court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request for relief shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual claim(s) or request(s) for relief in arbitration.

16.      Miscellaneous.

16.1.   Changes. DocSend may change these Terms from time to time. Customers can review the most current version of these Terms at any time at [https://www.docsend.com/terms-of-service/](https://www.docsend.com/terms-of-service/).  The revised provisions will become effective once posted or on any effective date indicated in the posting, and you accept the revised provisions by accessing or using the Service after that date.

16.3.   Notices. Notices must be sent via email, first class, airmail, or overnight courier and are deemed given when received.

Box 77767, San Francisco, CA 94107, attn.: Legal Department.

16.4.   Force Majeure.  Except for payment obligations, neither DocSend nor Customer will be liable for inadequate performance to the extent caused by a condition that was beyond the party’s reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, act of war or terrorism, riot, labor condition, governmental action, and Internet disturbance).

16.5.   Severability. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be modified or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable; and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.

16.6.   No Agency. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and Customer does not have any authority of any kind to bind DocSend in any respect whatsoever; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.

16.7.   No Third Party Beneficiaries. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights to the DocSend product or to any third party product made available through the Service.

16.8.   Headings. Section headings are for ease of reference only.

16.13. Survival. The following will survive any termination of these Terms: Sections 1.5, 1.7, 3.3, 3.4, 4, 8.4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, and 16; all indemnity provisions and all disclaimers and limitations of warranties and damages set forth in these Terms or otherwise existing at law all definitions used in the foregoing sections, regardless of where located; and all perpetual licenses granted under these Terms that are not expressly terminated.
