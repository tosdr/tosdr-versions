Copyright Infringement Notification
===================================

Last Modified: February 13, 2023

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.  DocSend will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the DMCA and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement, including terminating the account and access rights of any infringer in appropriate circumstances.  A notification of claimed copyright or other intellectual property infringement should be emailed to DocSend’s Copyright Agent at [\[email protected\]](https://www.docsend.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) using the subject line  “DMCA Takedown Request” (your “Notice”). You may also contact us by mail at:

Attention:  Copyright Agent  
Dropbox Inc.  
1800 Owens St  
San Francisco, CA 94158

**Notice:** To be effective, your Notice must be in writing and contain the following information:

* an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;
* a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
* a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site, with enough detail that we may find it on the Site;
* your address, telephone number, and email address;
* a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and
* a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.

**Counter-Notice**: If you believe that the relevant content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use such content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent at the points of contact provided above:

* your physical or electronic signature;
* identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
* a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
* your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court located within San Francisco County in the Northern District of California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, DocSend will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at DocSend’s sole discretion.

**Repeat Infringer Policy**:  In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, DocSend has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at DocSend’s sole discretion, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.  DocSend may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Site and/or terminate the Accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

Capitalized terms used above, but not defined, have the meanings provided in the DocSend Terms of Service.
