DocSend uses cookies and similar technologies on our Site and Service to operate and administer our Site and the Service, gather usage and performance data and give you a personalized experience with DocSend. As a part of our Service, we also use cookies and similar technologies to gather certain information about Viewers’ interaction with the Content that our Users share through our Service and to provide our Users with reporting and analytics relating to interactions with your Content and our Service. This is described in more detail below.

This Cookie Policy (“**Cookie Policy**”) provides information about how and when we use cookies and similar technologies for these purposes and the choices that you have. It forms part of DocSend’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.docsend.com/legal). Capitalized terms used in this Policy but not defined have the meaning set forth in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.docsend.com/legal), which also includes details about (i) why and how DocSend collects, uses, and stores Personal Data that we collect or receive through the Site or the Service, (ii) the lawful basis on which Personal Data is processed, (iii) how we protect your data, and (iv) what your rights and our obligations are in relation to such use.

#### 1\. Cookies and Other Technologies

A cookie is a piece of information sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can help a website like ours recognize repeat users and allow a website to track web usage behavior. For more details on cookies and similar technologies please visit [All About Cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time. “Session cookies” only last for as long as the browser session and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” cookies survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date set in the cookie (as determined by the third party placing it), and help recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again. We use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service.

We also use pixel tags (usually in combination with cookies), from the third parties described below, to get information about your usage of the Site and the Service and your interaction with email or other communications. Pixel tags are a technology similar to cookies that can be embedded in online content or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites (for example, to know when content has been shown to you), or to know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message.
