Purchase Policy (Formal Offer)
==============================

GILRAEN LIMITED (“NumBuster”, “we,” “us” or “our”) offers certain enhanced features (“Licenses”) as a onetime purchase (“Purchase”), or under monthly, quarterly, or annual subscription (“Subscription”).

A description of Licenses associated with any of our Subscriptions or Purchases are available via the Advanced Features section. When paying a License as a onetime Purchase or a Subscription (each, a “Transaction”), we may request from you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, such as your credit card number, its expiration date and your address (-es) for billing and delivery (“Payment Information”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any way (s) of payment represented by any such Payment Information. The amounts due and payable by you for a Transaction will be presented to you in the Advanced Features section before you place your order.

If you choose to initiate a Transaction via the Advanced Features section, you allow us to transfer your Payment Information to our third-party service providers so we can complete your

Transaction and agree:

1\. to pay the applicable fees and any taxes,

2\. that NumBuster may charge your credit card or third-party payment processing account, including, among others, your account with the app store or distribution platform (like the Apple App Store or Google Play) where the App is made available (each, an “App Provider”), for verification, preauthorization, and payment purposes, and

3\. to bear any additional charges that your App Provider, bank or other financial service provider may levy on you, as well as any taxes or fees that may apply to your order.

Your order is not binding on NumBuster until accepted and confirmed by NumBuster. All payments made are non-refundable and non-transferable except as provided in these Terms.

If you have any concerns or objections regarding charges, you agree to raise them with us first, and you agree not to cancel or reject any credit card or third-party payment processing charges unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the matter directly with NumBuster.

We reserve the right to not process or cancel your order in certain circumstances, for example, if your credit card is declined, or if we suspect the request or order is fraudulent, or in other circumstances NumBuster deems appropriate in its sole discretion. NumBuster also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to verify your identity in connection with your order. You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (we include such information within the definition of Payment Information). NumBuster will either not charge you or refund the charges for orders that we do not process or cancel.

NumBuster does not refund the charges for the paid Purchases or Subscriptions and is not liable for availability of certain features on certain smart-phone models or under certain software. We do not correct or refund the charges because of changes in the App functionality, or the completeness of data provided.

Within promotional events and loyalty programs, NumBuster keeps the right to provide discounts and promo codes and set prices for the certain users or groups of users regardless of an app store.

  
  
  

### **Subscriptions automatically renew until you cancel them. (How to Cancel Your Subscription)**

All amounts are payable and charged

* for one-off purchase (e.g., annual Subscription), at the time you place your order,
* for monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual subscription, at the beginning of the subscription period and, because each such subscription renews automatically for an additional period equal to the expiring subscription term, at the time of each renewal until you cancel it, using the Payment Information you have provided. You must cancel your monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual subscription before it renews automatically to avoid the billing of the fees for the next subscription period. If you purchase your Subscription via our website, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription at any time by contacting us via support@numbuster.com.

If you purchase a License via an App Provider, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription with the App Provider. You will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for your current subscription period, and you will continue to receive the Services ordered until the end of your current Subscription period.

Deleting an account and/or an application from a user's device does not automatically cancel the subscription. You must cancel the subscription through the standard procedure or contact support via email at [support@numbuster.com](mailto:support@numbuster.com).

  
  
  

### **Changes to Licenses (Subscriptions)**

NumBuster reserves the right to change its pricing terms for Subscriptions and NumBuster will notify you before such changes becoming effective. Changes to the pricing terms will not apply retroactively and will only apply for Subscription renewals after we have communicated such changed pricing terms to you. If you do not agree with the changes to our pricing terms, then you may choose not to renew your Subscription following our most up-to-date Terms of Service.

  
  
  

### **Future Functionality**

You agree that your Licenses (Purchases and Subscriptions) are not contingent on performing any future functionality or features, or dependent on any marketing or notifications related to future functionality or features.

  
  

### **Payment Card Security**

The payment systems that you can use to subscribe to NumBuster (or purchase regular licenses) employ a variety of payment security measures, the main one being the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This data security standard for the payment card industry was developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which was established by international payment systems such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, and Discover.

The standard is composed of 12 detailed requirements intended to secure the data of payment card holders as it is transmitted, stored, and processed within an organization's information infrastructure. Adopting suitable measures to ensure compliance with the standard's requirements implies a comprehensive approach to the protection of payment card information.
