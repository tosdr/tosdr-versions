Phone Number: Your phone number is required for registration. We verify your phone number by sending a message, making a phone call, or activating your profile through previously installed messengers.

It's important to note that we don’t extract phone numbers from your contact book; we only gather the contact titles.

3.2.2. The call log from the user's device will be synchronized with the System's servers. This is necessary to promptly inform the user about attempts of spam and fraud during a call, in the call log, and in similar situations. This information is not shared with third parties.

The image you select will be added to your Profile in the app AND uploaded to our servers.

When you opt to replace or delete this image (or any other image you've previously uploaded) via the user profile editing features in the NumBuster app, the image will be immediately hidden from view in the application. The actual deletion of the image from the NumBuster System and its servers will then proceed as swiftly as technical processes allow, ensuring the image is permanently removed within a reasonable timeframe.

6\. Procedure for Collection, Storage, Transfer, and Other Types of Personal Data Processing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1. Personal data processing is conducted with the User's consent. Agreeing to this Policy does not encompass the consent for processing personal data that's allowed for dissemination. This consent is obtained separately from the agreement to this Policy.

Before publishing your review or making your personal data available to general public in any other way, we will specifically ask you to confirm your consent to such dissemination. We will explain in a clear and detailed manner what data, for which purposes, and how we intend to use it. At this stage, you also have the option to set restrictions on the Operator regarding the transfer (beyond providing access) and/or processing, or set conditions for processing (beyond accessing) of personal data that the User has permitted for unrestricted dissemination.

6.2. The security of personal data processed by the Operator is ensured through the implementation of legal, administrative, and technical measures necessary to fully comply with current legislation in the field of personal data protection.
