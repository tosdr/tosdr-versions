The security of your Personal Information is important to us, which is why we maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect your information’s security, confidentiality and integrity.

You should not share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Sites like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Sites.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure and no website, database, or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to our Sites or the Services.

If you sign up to receive text messages from us that contains promotional information, you can opt-out of receiving future messages by replying “STOP.”

Users from the EEA, the UK, Switzerland or Canada will, if required by applicable law, receive such communications only after having consented hereto. Please note that “unsubscribe” requests may not take effect immediately and may take a reasonable amount of time to receive, process and apply, during which time your information shall remain subject to this Policy. Additionally, you should be aware that any information provided to third-parties prior to your election to unsubscribe will not be retrieved or rescinded, unless required by applicable law.

**California Do-Not-Track Disclosure**.  We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collected on our Sites and Services for third-party purposes. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations, and solutions. 

**Notice of Financial Incentive.**  You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. In certain cases, we may offer a gift card, coupon, discount, points towards a future purchase, or other financial incentive in exchange for your participation in our loyalty program, or for other reasons, such as in response to a survey that seeks feedback, or for providing information about your shopping behaviors.

**European Union/European Economic Area**

If you reside in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), the EU/EEA’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs our processing (as defined under GDPR) of your personal data, as well as your rights regarding the same. See the Your Rights section above. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the ICO if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR. If you wish to exercise this right, please contact us. You may also contact us using the contact information provided in our Policy. We have the right to refuse your request where there is a basis to do so in law, or if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

**Special Categories of Personal Data**

Our Sites and Services do not require the collection or processing of any sensitive personal data or sensitive information, as defined in applicable data protection laws (e.g., racial, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, etc.).  We may nevertheless collect such sensitive personal data about you, or we may collect it incidentally if you provide such data to us. By providing any sensitive personal data or by providing information by a recording, you consent to our collection of such information, however, we do not require or use such data to provide our Sites or Services. 

**International Transfers of Data**

Your personal data may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States, please note that we transfer the data, including personal data, to the United States and process it there. We adhere to the GDPR where it applies to our Sites or Services. Where your personal data is processed outside of the EEA, we will put in place appropriate safeguards.  Where appropriate, we may enter into Standard Contractual Clauses with importers or processors and/or other relevant third parties for the transfer of your personal data and may carry out a risk assessment and/or take necessary security measures in order to fulfill our obligations under GDPR. If we determine we are unable to provide equivalent protection of your personal data, including by entry into the Standard Contractual Clauses, we may seek to rely on derogations authorized by the GDPR, including the derogation of consent/contract/request of data subject. If relying on your consent, we will seek your explicit consent in advance.

**United Kingdom**

If you reside in the United Kingdom (UK), the UK’s General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) governs our processing (as defined therein) of your personal data, as well as your rights regarding the same. See the Your Rights section above. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the ICO if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes the UK GDPR. If you wish to exercise this right, please contact us. You may also contact us using the contact information provided in our Policy. We have the right to refuse your request where there is a basis to do so in law, or if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

**Lawful Basis for our Processing of Your Personal Data.**

Because we are a data controller, we are the ones who are responsible for establishing a lawful basis for the processing of your personal data. We rely on our legitimate interests under UK GDPR Article 6 in order to engage in the processing of your personal data. This means that we have a legitimate interest in receiving and processing your personal data in order to provide the Sites and Services. We might in some cases also rely on obtaining your consent under UK GDPR Article 6 as the lawful basis of our processing of your personal data. If so, this means that we have requested your explicit consent (or “opt-in”) to their processing of your data. If applicable, you will be provided with our Consent and/or Lawful Basis to Collection and Processing of personal data notice.

**Data Protection Officer.**

Aventon has appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO). 

**Special Categories of Personal Data**

Our Sites and Services do not require the collection or processing of any sensitive personal data or sensitive information, as defined in applicable data protection laws (e.g., racial, ethnical origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, etc.).  We may nevertheless collect such sensitive personal data about you, or we may collect it incidentally if you provide such data to us. By providing any sensitive information or by providing information by recording, you consent to our collection of such information and our use and disclosure of it in accordance with our Policy for purposes directly related to the reason it was provided.

**International Transfers of Data**

Your personal data may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States, please note that we transfer the data, including personal data, to the United States and process it there. We adhere to the UK GDPR where it applies to our Sites and Services. Where your data is processed outside of the UK, we have put in place appropriate safeguards.  Where appropriate, we may enter into the UK Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses with an importer or processor and/or other relevant third parties for the transfer of your personal data and may carry out a risk assessment and/or take necessary security measures in order to fulfill our obligations under the UK GDPR.

If we determine we are unable to provide equivalent protection of your personal data, including by entry into the UK Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses, we may seek to rely on derogations authorized by the UK GDPR, including the derogation of consent/contract/request of data subject. If relying on your consent, we will seek your explicit consent in advance.

**Canada**

At the Canadian federal level, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) establishes a framework for the collection and use of your Personal Information across Canada (e.g., if you are a candidate for employment of an organization that is a federally regulated work, undertaking, or business (e.g., Canadian bank, airline, broadcaster, etc.)). PIPEDA may not apply to Personal Information about you for use of our Sites or Services.

If PIPEDA does not apply, Canadian provincial privacy laws may still apply. We will comply with any such specific provincial privacy laws that apply to our Sites and Services.  For example, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec may have provincial privacy laws that apply to your Personal Information.

**Consent**

Depending on the applicable data protection laws, we may need to obtain your consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of your Personal Information. In Canada, your consent is only valid if it is reasonable to believe that you understand the nature, purpose, and consequences of the collection, use, or disclosure of your Personal Information. You may withdraw your consent at any time.

At the time of obtaining your consent, we must provide you with the following:

* An exhaustive list of types of Personal Information being collected and processed
* A list of third parties with whom it is being shared (including the countries for such parties if outside Canada)
* A stated commitment to handling your personal information according to our Policy, and provide a link to that policy
* An explanation of the risk of harm and other potential consequences in using our Sites and Services
* A “No, I do not consent” button or similar option and explain to you the consequences of withholding your consent, and
* A statement of the possibility for you to withdraw your consent after providing it.

If applicable, you will be provided with our Consent and/or Lawful Basis to Collection and Processing of Personal Data notice.

**Opting Out of Email Communications**

Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) requires your consent on an opt-in basis in order for us to communicate with you by email. If you elect to provide us with an email address, we will treat such provision as your consent to opt-in to our use of email as a communication means. If applicable, you will be provided with our Consent and/or Lawful Basis to Collection and Processing of Personal Data notice. You may opt-out of email communication at any time.

**15.** **Contact Us**
