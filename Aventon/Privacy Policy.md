**Rights and Choices.** As a California resident, you have the rights listed below in relation to your Personal Information; however, your rights are subject to certain exceptions. For instance, we cannot disclose specific pieces of Personal Information if the disclosure would create a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of the Personal Information, your account with us or the security of our network systems. 

  

You may exercise your CCPA rights to know, access and delete by contacting us here[https://www.aventon.com/pages/contact](https://www.aventon.com/pages/contact), or by calling: (866) 300-3311.  Please note that we will need to confirm your identity and California residency to process your requests to exercise your rights to know, access, or delete your Personal Information. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.  You may designate an authorized agent to make a request to access or a request to delete on your behalf. We will respond to your authorized agent’s request if they submit proof that they are registered with the California Secretary of State to be able to act on your behalf, or submit evidence you have provided them with power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code section 4000 to 4465. We may deny requests from authorized agents who do not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf, or are unable to verify their identity.

  

* _Right Against Discrimination_. You are entitled to exercise the rights described below free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions. 
* _Right to Know_. You have the right to request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past twelve (12) months:

* The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.
* The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.
* The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.
* The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.

Some of those third parties may use your Personal Information for their own purposes or to provide services to other businesses. Under the CCPA, the sharing of this type of information is a “sale,” and you can opt-out of having your information shared in this way.   

If you wish to opt out of the use of your Personal Information for interest-based advertising purposes and these potential sales as defined under CCPA law, you may do so by following the instructions below.  Please note that any opt out is specific to the browser you use. You may need to opt out on every browser that you use.
