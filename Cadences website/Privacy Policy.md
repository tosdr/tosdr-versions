Privacy policy
==============

This document contains details about the data this website collects, what it is used for, how it is stored, how it is shared, and how it can be removed.

Data collected
--------------

### Data provided by you

CloudTube will store this information when you personally enter it into the site:

* personal settings
* list of channels you have subscribed to
* list of videos you have watched (only if enabled in settings)

### Data collected passively

When your device requests any resource from CloudTube, this information about the request may be stored for up to 14 days:

* the time the request was made
* the IP address
* the requested URL
* the response status code

Accounts and cookies
--------------------

CloudTube does not allow users to create accounts.

The first time a user personally provides data to the site, such as changing settings or subscribing to a channel, an ephemeral session is created and linked to a cookie.

On future visits, this cookie will be used to look up the session, and provide a response based on that stored information.

As described above, no personally identifiable information is linked to sessions.

If the user never personally provides data to the site, no cookie will be stored.

What the data is used for
-------------------------

* providing the core service
* providing information for debugging

How the data is shared
----------------------

### With YouTube

YouTube is a company owned by Google, Inc. CloudTube displays information from YouTube.

When you perform a query on CloudTube that requires data from YouTube, such as making a search or loading a video, your query is forwarded to YouTube.

For example, when searching, YouTube receives a query for those search terms, and when watching a video, YouTube receives a page load for that video.

When watching a video, your browser connects to googlevideo.com directly to request the video stream. This connection, and any data stored by YouTube as a result, is subject to [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

All other queries are forwarded to your selected Invidious instance, which forwards them to YouTube. YouTube does not receive any metadata about you for these queries, only the query itself.

### With other organisations

CloudTube does not share any data with other people or organisations.

How to delete your data
-----------------------

[Visit the settings page](https://tube.cadence.moe/settings) and find the "delete data" section. Read the text.

To delete your data, check "I understand the consequences", then click "permanently erase my data".

This will erase all of your data from the server, and delete the unique cookie from your web browser.

Released as AGPL free software.
