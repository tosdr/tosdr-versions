* CloudTube is a proxy service for YouTube videos.
* CloudTube does not store any videos. Videos are never saved to these servers.
* CloudTube reproduces data from youtube.com in an interface that looks a little bit different.
* All video data is streamed directly from YouTube. All video metadata is collected directly from YouTube.

And understand this:
--------------------

Anybody can watch or download YouTube videos using many freely available tools. This is just one such tool, and attacking this website will solve none of your problems.

“I still want to remove access.”
