These other resources are not under our control, and you acknowledge that we are not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply our endorsement or any association between us and their operators. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such website or resource.

We can cut off your access to the Services at any time and don’t guarantee that we will retain your information.

You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and each of our and their respective employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the Services, Content, or otherwise from your User Content, violation of these Terms of Service, or infringement by you of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.

##### 12\. Modification

##### Short version

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms of Service, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Site or by sending you notice through the Services, or by another appropriate means of electronic communication. We may also impose limits on certain features of the Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. While we will timely provide notice of modifications, it is also your responsibility to check these Terms of Service periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following notification of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.

We may update these Terms of Services from time to time. We will post a notice of any changes prior to them taking effect, but it’s your responsibility to keep up to date with the Terms of Service regularly. We post the last update date at the bottom of these Terms of Service to make it easier for you to know if the Terms of Service have changed.

##### 13\. Miscellaneous

##### Short version

Entire Agreement and Severability  
These Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Except as expressly stated in Section 8, these Terms of Services do not create any third party beneficiary rights.

Force Majeure  
We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.

Assignment  
These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.

Agency  
No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.

Notices  
Unless otherwise specified in these Terms of Service, all notices to us under these Terms of Service will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when receipt is electronically confirmed. Notices should be sent to [legal@socratic.org](mailto:legal@socratic.org).

No Waiver  
The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Additionally, our failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of Service. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.

Headings  
The section and paragraph headings in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation.

These Terms of Services are the entire agreement between us. We’re not responsible for not doing something if it’s due to something out of our control, like a blackout. These Terms of Service are between Socratic and you and you can’t transfer this agreement to someone else without our consent.
