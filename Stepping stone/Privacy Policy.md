All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to stepping stone Ltd, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

stepping stone Ltd does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.

Use of Cookies
--------------

The stepping stone Ltd website use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience.

Use of Social Plugins
---------------------

Our websites use social plugins from sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Xing. The plugins are marked with the provider’s logo, e.g. “Like” buttons.

If you access one of our websites and it contains one of these plugins, the provider will be notified via the plugin that you have accessed our website. If you are logged into the provider’s site at the same time, the provider can match up your visit to your profile. If you interact with the plugins, the corresponding information will be transmitted directly from your browser to the provider and stored there.

If you do not want providers to collect data about you, you can select the “Block cookies from third-party providers” option in your browser settings. If there is embedded content from other providers, the browser will then no longer send corresponding information to that provider’s server. However, in some cases this setting will mean that other content on our website no longer works.

stepping stone Ltd secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. stepping stone Ltd secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
