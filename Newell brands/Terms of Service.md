**Choice of Law**  
Newell Brands controls and manages this website from its facilities in the State of Georgia in the United States of America. Unless otherwise stated, materials and content on this website are presented solely for promoting products and services in the United States of America.

We make no representation that such information, products, programs or services referenced on this website are legal, available or appropriate in your country or region.

**Disputes**  
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to these to the Terms of Use, this website, or any products or services sold or distributed by or through this website, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to the Terms of Use. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.
