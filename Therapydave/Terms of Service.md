The following Terms of Services (the “Agreement”) govern your access to and use of this website, [therapydave.com](https://therapydave.com/), and any of its services (collectively referred to as the “Site”). This website is owned and operated by TherapyDave™ (the “Company”).

When the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” or similar are used in this Agreement, they refer to the Company.

By accessing or using the Site, you agree to comply with and be bound by this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully. If you do not agree to any part of this Agreement, you must not use the Site.

Additional definitions, terms, and conditions can be found in the [Privacy Policy](https://therapydave.com/privacy/) and [Disclaimer](https://therapydave.com/disclaimer/), which are hereby expressly incorporated into this document by reference.

Appointment Requests
--------------------

You can [request an appointment online via the Site](https://therapydave.com/therapist-appointments/), but submitting an appointment request does not guarantee a confirmed appointment or establish a therapist-client relationship. We will review your request and contact you to confirm availability and suitability. All appointments are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone at our discretion.

Client-Therapist Relationship
-----------------------------

A therapist-client relationship is established only after an initial assessment and the mutual agreement to proceed with therapy services. Until such an agreement is reached, any communication between you and TherapyDave, including via email, phone, or website, is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a therapeutic relationship.

Confidentiality
---------------

We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of all communications and information shared during the therapy process. However, please be aware that electronic communications, including email and web forms, may not be entirely secure. For confidential matters, we recommend using more secure methods of communication.

Fees and Payment
----------------

The fees for our therapy services will be discussed and agreed upon during your initial consultation. Payment is due at the time of service unless otherwise arranged. We accept various forms of payment, which will be communicated to you during your appointment confirmation.

Cancellation Policy
-------------------

If you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment, please provide at least 48 hours’ notice. Cancellations made with less than 48 hours’ notice may be subject to a cancellation fee.

Telehealth Services
-------------------

In addition to in-person services, we also offer telehealth services for clients who are unable to attend in-person sessions. By using our telehealth services, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions specific to telehealth, which will be provided to you prior to your first telehealth session.

Service Availability
--------------------

Therapy services are provided exclusively to clients located in Oregon and Arizona, where our licensed therapist operates. For clients in other locations, we offer professional life coaching services. The distinctions between therapy and life coaching will be thoroughly explained during your initial consultation. This ensures you receive the appropriate support tailored to your needs.

Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute will be conducted solely on an individual basis, and you shall not seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, a representative action, a collective action, a private attorney-general action, or in any proceeding in which you act or propose to act in a representative capacity. You further agree that no arbitration or proceeding will be joined, consolidated, or combined with another arbitration or proceeding.
