Terms and Conditions
====================

_Last updated: July 25, 2023_

Welcome to the website, [therapydave.com](https://therapydave.com/)!

Programs
--------

Certain features allow for interactive use, such as the Session Notes program or other electronic features (“Program” or “Programs”). These programs are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR ANY PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

No Surprises Act
----------------

You have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” explaining how much your medical care will cost. Under the law, health care providers need to give **patients who don’t have insurance or who are not using insurance** an estimate of the bill for medical items and services.

* You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency items or services. This includes related costs like medical tests, prescription drugs, equipment, and hospital fees.
* Make sure your health care provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate in writing at least 1 business day before your medical service or item.
* You can also ask your health care provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule an item or service.
* If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill.
* Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.

For questions or more information about your right to a Good Faith Estimate, visit [www.cms.gov/nosurprises](https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises) or call 877-696-6775.

Affiliate Marketing
-------------------

I occasionally partner as an affiliate with other businesses. For example, I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon properties including, but not limited to, amazon.com. This means that any time you click on a book or product link on the Site, and should you then choose to purchase that item through the Amazon website, I may receive a very small percentage of that sale. Please understand that I do not market on behalf of Amazon or any other affiliate. I only share books, products, and resources that I support, use and believe in.

If you choose to purchase a product on this website, or if you choose to purchase a product on another site where I provide the link, you agree to assume full responsibility for using the information on this website, and you understand and agree that I am not responsible or liable for any claim, loss, or damage resulting from its use by you or any user. I cannot guarantee any results or outcomes if you choose to purchase any of the services offered on this website or through a site link I provide or an affiliate’s website or business. As with any business-related program, product, material, book or service that you purchase, your results may vary, and will be based on many variables, so therefore no guarantees can be made.

Changes to Terms
----------------

I reserve the right, in my sole discretion, to change the Terms under which this website is offered. The most current version of the Terms will supersede all previous versions. I encourage you to periodically review the Terms to stay informed of any updates.

Children under 13
-----------------

I do not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personal information from persons under the age of thirteen. If you are under 18, you may use this website only with permission of a parent or guardian.

Class Action Waiver
-------------------

Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute will be conducted solely on an individual basis, and you shall not seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, a representative action, a collective action, a private attorney-general action or in any proceeding in which you act or proposes to act in a representative capacity. You further agree that no arbitration or proceeding will be joined, consolidated or combined with another arbitration or proceeding.

Cookies
-------

I use my own and third-party cookies and web beacons to help the site function properly, analyze usage, and for marketing purposes. Your IP address and third party identifier may be shared with advertising partners to help us deliver more relevant ads. By using this website, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and web beacons to collect information on and off this site as described here.

Governing Law; Forum

Any dispute between the parties regarding the subject matter of these Terms will be governed by these Terms and the laws of the State of Oregon and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to any actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property, or relating to these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Lane County, Oregon (except for small claims disputes, which may be filed in the jurisdiction in which you reside), and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.

Indemnification
---------------

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold TherapyDave harmless, as well as its independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and our and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the “Company Parties”) from and against any claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees).

Termination
-----------

I reserve the right, without advance notice and at our sole discretion, to terminate your access to this website and the related services or any portion thereof at any time. To the maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of Lane County in the State of Oregon and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Oregon in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of this website.

“At first, I thought I was working through the feelings around my failing marriage and subsequent divorce. Then I realized that I was struggling to actually process the feelings and grief I had been carrying. Now, I’m feeling a sense of empowerment and freedom like I’ve never had before.”
