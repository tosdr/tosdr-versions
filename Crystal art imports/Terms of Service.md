It is our policy to respond appropriately to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement, as set forth more fully below. In CRYSTAL ART US's sole discretion, CRYSTAL ART US may remove content that may be infringing on another person's intellectual property rights with or without notice to the potential infringer. In accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable law, CRYSTAL ART US has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at CRYSTAL ART US's sole discretion, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner's) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Sites, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following: (i) a legend or subject line that says: "DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice"; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Sites on which the material appears); (iv) your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and (vii) your electronic or physical signature.<br><br>CRYSTAL ART US will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, or e-mail at the addresses below:<br><br>By Mail: CRYSTAL ART IMPORTS, INC., Attn: Legal Department, 6185-K Huntley Rd. Columbus, OH 43229  <br>By E-Mail: [info@crystalclassics.com](mailto:info@crystalclasssics.com)  <br><br>It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. CRYSTAL ART US may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and CRYSTAL ART US may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.<br><br>PRODUCT AND SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS, PRICING, AND AVAILABILITY<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>With respect to its offering of information, products, and services on the Sites, CRYSTAL ART US attempts to be as accurate as possible. Nevertheless, CRYSTAL ART US does not warrant that information, product or service descriptions, product availability, or other content of these Sites is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Despite our efforts, it is possible due to computer or other error or cause that a product or service offered on these Sites may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable. In the event CRYSTAL ART US determines that a product or service is mispriced or described inaccurately, CRYSTAL ART US reserves the right to take any action it deems reasonable and necessary, in its sole discretion, to rectify the error, including without limitation canceling your order. You agree to notify CRYSTAL ART US immediately if you become aware of any pricing or descriptive errors or inconsistencies with any products or services you order through these Sites and comply with any corrective action taken by CRYSTAL ART US.<br><br>SHIPPING<br>--------<br><br>For products ordered on these Sites, CRYSTAL ART US will ship only to U.S. addresses in the 50 States and the District of Columbia, excluding Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, U.S. post office box addresses, and APO addresses.

If these laws apply, some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations, may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights to those contained herein. In such states, CRYSTAL ART US's liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.<br><br>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL CRYSTAL ART US' TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, FOR ALL POSSIBLE DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITES AND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS, EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID CRYSTAL ART US IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION(S) THAT UNDERLIE THE CLAIM(S); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THIS PROVISION WILL NOT APPLY IF A COURT OR TRIBUNAL WITH APPLICABLE JURISDICTION FINDS SUCH TO BE UNCONSCIONABLE. FOR PURPOSES OF CLARITY, THE PRIOR SENTENCE DOES NOT EXPAND OR LIMIT ANY EXPRESS, WRITTEN PRODUCT WARRANTY THAT IS PROVIDED BY CRYSTAL ART US OR A MANUFACTURER OF A PHYSICAL PRODUCT.<br><br>INDEMNITY<br>---------<br><br>You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless CRYSTAL ART US and its affiliates and their respective shareholders, directors, members, managers, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all liability, claims, costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable legal fees and expenses), arising out of, resulting from, or in connection with, your use of these Sites and/or any third party sites and/or your use of the products obtained from CRYSTAL ART US.<br><br>THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS<br>------------------<br><br>The provisions of the Product and Service Descriptions and Pricing, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, and Indemnity sections above are for the benefit of CRYSTAL ART US and its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers, and any third-party information providers to these Sites. Each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce those provisions directly against you on its own behalf.<br><br>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION<br>-----------------------------------------<br><br>Certain portions of this Section ("Dispute Resolution Section") are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and CRYSTAL ART US agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Dispute Resolution Section can only be amended by mutual agreement.<br><br>A. First - Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes. If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises between you and CRYSTAL ART US, including, out of the Sites, this Agreement or any services or products ordered through the Sites, the content, or your submissions (including, Unsolicited Ideas and Materials), whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, "Dispute"), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Dispute Resolution Section (A). Your notice to us must be sent to: CRYSTAL ART IMPORTS INC., c/o 6185-K Huntley Rd. Columbus, OH 43229 (Attn: Legal Department). For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, CRYSTAL ART US and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though nothing will require either you or CRYSTAL ART US to resolve the Dispute on terms with respect to which you and CRYSTAL ART US, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.<br><br>B. Binding Arbitration. AS USED HEREIN, THE FOLLOWING DISPUTES WILL BE "ARBITRATION DISPUTES", WHICH MAY ONLY BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH HEREIN: ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATED TO DATA COLLECTION, DATA PRIVACY OR SECURITY, DATA BREACH, TEXT MESSAGING, OR COLLECTION, USE, OR DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUAL OR AGGREGATE CONSUMER INFORMATION AND DATA WHETHER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE OR OTHERWISE. ALL ARBITRATION DISPUTES MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THEN-CURRENT COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA"), except as modified herein, and in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be administered by the AAA. The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") shall govern the arbitrability of all Arbitration Disputes between CRYSTAL ART US and you regarding this Agreement and the Sites, including the No Class Action Matters section below. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY ARBITRATION DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms or the Site. You can obtain AAA procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: 800.778.7879 and [http://www.adr.org.](http://www.adr.org/)<br><br>C. Limited Time to File Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION TO THE OTHER PARTY) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.<br><br>D. Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution Section will not apply to any legal action taken by CRYSTAL ART US to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or CRYSTAL ART US' intellectual property rights (including such we may claim that may be in dispute), CRYSTAL ART US' operations, and/or CRYSTAL ART US' products or services.<br><br>E. No Class Action Matters. YOU AND CRYSTAL ART US AGREE THAT WITH RESPECT TO ARBITRATION DISPUTES EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION. All Arbitration Disputes will be heard or arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other claims or arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. There shall be no right or authority for any Arbitration Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Arbitration Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that the restriction set forth in this Dispute Resolution Section (E) is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Dispute Resolution Section (B) to arbitrate will not apply and the Arbitration Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Dispute Resolution Section (G). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Dispute Resolution Section, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section (E), including the class action waiver provisions contained herein, are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.<br><br>F. Small Claims Matters Are Excluded From Arbitration Requirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claims of disputes (including Arbitration Disputes) in small claims court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>G. Federal and State Courts in Franklin County, Columbus. Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Dispute Resolution Section (B), small claims actions, or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award with respect to an Arbitration Dispute, any action or proceeding relating to the Site and/or these Terms may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Franklin County, Columbus. Accordingly, you and CRYSTAL ART US consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters, and waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.<br><br>SEVERABILITY<br>------------<br><br>If any provision or portion thereof set forth in these terms, provisions and conditions is found to be unlawful, void or, for any other reason unenforceable, then such provision or portion thereof shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision.<br><br>TERMINATION<br>-----------<br><br>Notwithstanding any of these terms and conditions, this Agreement may be terminated by either party without notice at any time for any reason; provided that you may no longer access or use these Sites after this Agreement has been terminated. The sections of this Agreement entitled Copyright; Trademarks and Service Marks; Submissions; Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity; Third-Party Rights; Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration; Severability, Termination; Enforceability and Admissibility; and Waiver, Modification, and Assignment shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Sites, or upon notice from CRYSTAL ART US, all rights granted to you under these terms or Agreement will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Sites.<br><br>WAIVER OF INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF<br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITES, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY RELIEF IN ANY FORUM THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, USER-GENERATED CONTENT, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY CRYSTAL ART US OR A LICENSOR OF CRYSTAL ART US.<br><br>ENFORCEABILITY AND ADMISSIBILITY<br>--------------------------------<br><br>This electronic document and any other electronic documents, policies, and guidelines incorporated herein will be: (1) deemed for all purposes to be a "writing" or "in writing," and to comply with all statutory, contractual, and other legal requirements for a writing; (2) legally enforceable as a signed writing as against the parties subject to the electronic documents; and (3) deemed an "original" when printed from electronic records established and maintained in the ordinary course of business. Electronic documents introduced as evidence in any judicial, arbitration, mediation or administrative proceeding will, if established and maintained in the ordinary course of business, be admissible to the same extent as business records in written form that are similarly established and maintained.<br><br>WAIVER, f, AND ASSIGNMENT<br>-------------------------<br><br>CRYSTAL ART US's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right thereof. Neither the course of conduct between the CRYSTAL ART US and a user of these Sites nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement. CRYSTAL ART US may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.<br><br>NOTICES, QUESTIONS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>---------------------------------------<br><br>You agree that: (1) we may give you notices of new, revised or changed terms and other important matters by prominently posting notice on the home page of the Sites, or in another reasonable manner; and (2) we may contact you by mail or e-mail sent to the address provided by you.
