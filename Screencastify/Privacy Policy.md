### **Student Privacy Notice**

Screencastify takes the privacy of Students very seriously. This site and the Services are intended for general audiences and are not intended for use by Users under the age of 13 (or under 18 without supervision from a parent or guardian), provided however, that Students, including Students under the age of 13, may use the Services for educational purposes at the invitation and direction of their School or School Representative. Other than Students who are using the Services at the direction of their School, we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, "COPPA") require us to inform parents and legal guardians (‚Äúparents‚Äù) about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from Students under the age of 13. In accordance with COPPA, a School or School Representative may act as the agent of the parent or legal guardian of a Student and provide consent on behalf of the parent for Screencastify‚Äôs collection, use and disclosure of the Student‚Äôs information so long as such collection, use and disclosure are solely related to the Student‚Äôs use of the Services for educational purposes. By enrolling a Student to use the Services, the School provides such consent to us to use, collect and share Student information as needed to provide the Services and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please contact us at [\[email¬†protected\]](https://www.screencastify.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 that is not at the direction of their School so that we may delete their information as soon as possible. How we collect, use and share information regarding Students is identified in the applicable sections of the Privacy Policy, however, in some cases, Schools may have the option to further limit the collection of Student data. We do not ever sell, rent or license Student information or use it for purposes other than as needed to provide the Services.

Parents of Students have certain rights with respect to their Student‚Äôs data, including the right to review, update or delete Student information, as well as prohibit our sharing of Student information with third parties. Parents can exercise these rights by contacting the Student‚Äôs School or School Representative. The School or School Representative should submit these requests on the parent‚Äôs behalf by emailing [\[email¬†protected\]](https://www.screencastify.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Unless such a request is made, we will continue to collect, use and share Student information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

If your Organization is school or school district, we will work with you as far as we are legally able to accommodate your directions regarding our treatment of personal data belonging to your Students and ensuring that you maintain control of such Student information as may be required by applicable law, including FERPA, provided however, that our ability to do this may be limited by the type of services plan held by the applicable School.

This includes adhering to a school district‚Äôs requests after Screencastify is no longer in use by such Organization or after this policy is terminated or expires in relation to transfers of students‚Äô personal data, deleting students‚Äô personal data and making sure that any third parties that work in connection with Screencastify do the same, in each case subject to our legal requirements regarding the use, storage and transfer of such data.

Finally, Screencastify has taken and upholds the Student Privacy Pledge per the terms consistent on [studentprivacypledge.org](https://studentprivacypledge.org/).

### **Security**

We use security and technology measures consistent with industry standards to try to protect your information and make sure that it is not lost, damaged or accessed by anyone who should not see it. Your data is stored in Google Cloud in the United States. To learn more about Google Cloud‚Äôs security measures, please visit [https://cloud.google.com/security](https://cloud.google.com/security). Despite our security measures, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.

In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of your data we will notify you (either directly or through your School or School Representative) in accordance with our legal or contractual requirements.

### **Videos Recorded with Screencastify**

Any video you create with Screencastify belongs to you, subject to your compliance with Screencastify‚Äôs Terms of Use. We will handle videos you create in accordance with this Privacy Policy; however, the Screencastify platform is not intended for user generated content containing sensitive data such as social security numbers, financial account information, health information or other highly sensitive data. You may be permitted to store recordings you create on the Screencastify Platform on a third party service, in which case they will be transferred to the respective third party service and Screencastify will not be responsible for the handling or treatment of such content. Please consult the privacy policy of the applicable third party service provider to see how it handles your files.
