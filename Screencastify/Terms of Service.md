This indemnity shall be applicable without regard to the negligence of any party, including any indemnified person.

8. **_Arbitration Agreement_**

**PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT IS PART OF YOUR CONTRACT WITH SCREENCASTIFY AND AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.**

_Applicability of Arbitration Agreement_. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with these Terms or the use of any Screencastify Services that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court must be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Screencastify, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under these Terms.

_Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution_. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: Screencastify, LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, 333 N. Green St, Suite 810, Chicago, IL 60607. After the Notice is received, you and Screencastify may attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If you and Screencastify do not resolve the dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.

_Arbitration Rules_. Arbitration must be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), an established alternative dispute resolution provider ("ADR Provider") that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties must agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider ("Arbitration Rules") will govern all aspects of this arbitration, including the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except where such rules are in conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at [**www.adr.org**](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A single, neutral arbitrator must conduct the arbitration. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party must bear its own costs (including attorney's fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and must pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

‚Äç

_Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration_. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration must be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the party initiating the arbitration must choose the specific manner. The arbitration may not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless mutually agreed by the parties.

_Time Limits_. If you or Screencastify pursue arbitration, the arbitration must be initiated or demanded within the legal statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.

_Authority of Arbitrator_. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will have all authority to decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Screencastify in accordance with applicable law, the Arbitration Rules and these Terms, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Screencastify.

_Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes must be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. If any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND SCREENCASTIFY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

_Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions_. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

_Confidentiality_. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, must be kept confidential unless otherwise required by law. This Paragraph does not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

_Severability_. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts will be of no force and effect and will be severed and the remainder of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

_Right to Waive_. The party against whom the claim is asserted may waive any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Agreement. Such waiver does not waive or effect any other portion of this Agreement.

_Emergency Equitable Relief_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.

_Claims Not Subject to Arbitration_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret are not subject to this arbitration agreement.

_Courts_. In any circumstances where the foregoing Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Cook County, Illinois, for such purpose.

9. **_General Provisions_**

Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to its choice of law principles. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the parties remain bound by all other provisions. In that event, the invalid or non- binding provision will be replaced with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of this Agreement. Screencastify may assign this Agreement and all incorporated agreements in its sole discretion by providing notice to you. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to Screencastify shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to Screencastify, LLC, 333 N. Green St., Suite 810, Chicago IL 60607. Any notices to you will be provided to you through the Services or given to you via the email address provided at registration. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. A party‚Äôs failure to act with respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a waiver of the party‚Äôs right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Unless you are an Organization and have a separate subscription agreement that supersedes these Terms, these Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and Screencastify with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all previous understandings and agreements between the parties, whether oral or written.
