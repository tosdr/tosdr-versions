You may not settle any such claim without our express written consent. This defense and indemnification obligation is intended to extend to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and will survive these Terms and Conditions and your use of the Site.

13\. Disputes
-------------

By using the website, you agree that any dispute in any manner arising out of or relating in any way to the Terms and Conditions shall be submitted to binding arbitration with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) pursuant to JAMS’ arbitration rules, held before a single neutral arbitrator in the Los Angeles, California area. The parties to arbitration may use legal counsel at their own expense, and the prevailing party shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney’s fees. All costs of arbitration (including arbitrator fees) shall be paid by Sky Castle Studios, except only if the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, or that if you bring the arbitration, you may be charged an initial filing fee that shall not exceed the filing fees that you would incur for bringing an action in court. This provision will not affect any claimant’s rights to seek relief from small claims court. **Claims brought on behalf of or allegedly representing or including other persons or entities, including but not limited to any class, consolidated, representative, collective or private attorney general action, shall be a “Class Action.” Notwithstanding anything else in the Privacy Policy or the JAMS rules but subject to the exception for injunctive or equitable relief and public injunctive relief below, any parties subject to this arbitration provision shall be barred from bringing or participating in any Class Action related to a dispute covered by this arbitration provision. You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with us, our officers, directors, managers, employees, attorneys, agents or affiliates, arising out of or relating to your use of the website or these Terms and Conditions: YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.** However, if these Class Action restrictions are ever deemed illegal or unenforceable, they shall be severed from this arbitration provision. In that event, any Class Action shall by exempt from this arbitration provision and brought in court. This arbitration provision is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having valid jurisdiction thereof. This clause shall not preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court with appropriate jurisdiction, including equitable relief or other provisional relief as appropriate and as allowed under this agreement, in which case the parties submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of Los Angeles, California, Central District.

14\. General
------------

You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions, which include our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between us concerning your use of the website, and supersede and govern all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms and Conditions at any time by posting the changes on the Site and any changes are effective immediately.

Nothing contained in these Terms and Conditions shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between us. Our failure to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not affect our full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall our waiver of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by any applicable arbitral award or court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms and Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a whole. We will amend or replace such provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, our original objectives and intent as reflected in the original provision.
