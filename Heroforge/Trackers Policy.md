Hero Forge® Cookie Policy
=========================

HeroForge.com (“Site”) uses cookies.
------------------------------------

We use cookies to personalize content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyze our traffic. We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners who may combine it with other information that you’ve provided to them or that they’ve collected from your use of their services. You consent to our cookies if you continue to use our website.

A cookie is a small string of information that the website you visit transfers to your computer for identification purposes. Cookies can be used to follow your activity on the website and that information helps websites to understand your preferences and improve your website experience. Cookies are also used for such activities as remembering your user name and password, if you use such a feature on this Site. You can turn off all cookies in the event you prefer not to receive them. You can also have your computer warn you whenever cookies are being used. There are also software products available that can manage cookies for you. Please be aware, however, that when you choose to reject cookies, this choice may limit the functionality of the website and you may lose access to some of its features.

The law states that we can store cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary for the operation of this site. For all other types of cookies we need your permission.

Type of Cookies Used
--------------------

We use different types of cookies to run our Site. Some or all of the cookies identified below may be stored in your browser.

| Type of Cookie | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Strictly Necessary Cookies | Strictly Necessary cookies are necessary for the operation of our Site. These cookies are essential in helping you to move around our Site and use the features, such as accessing secure areas of the Site, or using the shopping basket. |
| Performance Cookies | These cookies collect information about how visitors use our services, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies collect anonymous information on the pages visited. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how our services perform.  <br>  <br>Web analytics that use cookies to gather data to enhance the performance of a website fall into this category. For example, they may be used for testing designs and ensuring a consistent look and feel is maintained for the user. This category does not include cookies used for behavioral/targeted advertising networks. |
| Functionality Cookies | These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.  <br>  <br>These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience.  <br>  <br>If the same cookie is used for re-targeting they must be included in the ‘Targeting or advertising cookies’ category as well. It might also include cookies that are used to deliver a specific function, but where that function includes cookies used for behavioral/targeted advertising networks they must be included in the ‘Targeting or advertising cookies’ category as well as this category. |
| Targeting Cookies | Targeting cookies help us make sure that the ads you see on our Site are relevant to you and your interests. Targeting cookies may also be placed on your device by our third party service providers that remember you have visited the Site in order to provide you with ads more relevant to you. |

  

Many of the cookies placed through our Site are session cookies, while others are persistent cookies, and some are “first-party” cookies, while others are “third-party” cookies.

* **First-party cookies** are those set by a Site that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., cookies placed by Hero Forge).
* **Third-party cookies** are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the Site being visited by the user. If a user visits a Site and another entity sets a cookie through that Site, this would be a third-party cookie.
* **Persistent cookies** are cookies that remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the Site that created that particular cookie.
* **Session cookies** are cookies that allow Site operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
