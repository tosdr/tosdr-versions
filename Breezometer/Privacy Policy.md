4. HOW WE PROTECT AND RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION
    1. Security. We have implemented appropriate technical, organizational and security measures designed to protect your personal data. However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be compromised as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers. As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer, device or network you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your user IDs and passwords, please make sure to take appropriate measures to protect this information.
    2. Retention of your Personal Data. In addition to the retention periods mentioned above, in some circumstances we may store your Personal Data for longer periods of time, for example (i) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements, or (ii) for us to have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or (iii) if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your Personal Data or dealings. We have an internal data retention policy to ensure that we do not retain your Personal Data perpetually. Regarding retention of cookies, you can read more in our [cookie policy](https://www.breezometer.com/cookies-policy).
5. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
    
    In addition to the recipients described above, we may share your Personal Data as follows:
    
    1. With our business partners with whom we jointly offer products or services. We may also share Personal Data with our affiliated companies.
    2.

    3. If, in the future, we sell or transfer, or we consider selling or transferring, some or all of our business, shares or assets to a third party, we will disclose your Personal Data to such third party (whether actual or potential) in connection with the foregoing events;
    4. In the event that we are acquired by, or merged with, a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer, disclose or assign your Personal Data in connection with the foregoing events; and/or

6. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA
    1. Storage: We store our data in Hubspot CRM. The HubSpot platform is hosted in data center providers in the US - Amazon Web Services in the US-East-1 region. Google Cloud Platform- data stored here is located in the US.
    2. Internal transfers: Transfers within the Breezometer Group will be covered by an internal processing agreement entered into by members of the Breezometer Group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that Personal Data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred to.
    3. External transfers: Where we transfer your Personal Data outside of the European Union (including the European Economic Area) (“EU”), the United Kingdom and Switzerland (for example to third parties who provide us with services), we will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your Personal Data. When we engage in such transfers of personal information, we may rely on i) Adequacy Decisions as adopted by European Commission on the basis of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) (for example, when we access from Israel), ii) the Data Privacy Framework described below, or iii) Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission. We also continually monitor the circumstances surrounding such transfers in order to ensure that these maintain, in practice, a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to the one guaranteed by applicable law, such as the GDPR.  
        Data Privacy Framework: As described in our parent company Google LLC’s [Data Privacy Framework certification](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI), we comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework” or “DPF”), as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information received in the U.S. from the EU, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland in reliance on the DPF. Google LLC and its wholly owned US subsidiaries has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the DPF Principles. Breezometer remains responsible for any of your personal information that is shared under the Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for external processing on our behalf, as described in the “How We Share Your Personal Data” section. To learn more about the DPF certification program, and to view our parent company Google LLC’s certification, please visit the [Data Privacy Framework website](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/). If you have an inquiry or complaint regarding our privacy practices in relation to our DPF certification, we encourage you to contact us at [privacy@breezometer.com](mailto:privacy@breezometer.com). Google is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority, and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain circumstances, the Data Privacy Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the [Data Privacy Framework Principles](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2.).
7. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS. HOW TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT
    1. Rights: The following rights (which may be subject to certain exemptions or derogations) shall apply to certain individuals (some of which only apply to individuals protected by the GDPR):

        * You have the right to object, to or to request restriction, of the processing;

When processing your request, we may ask you for additional information to confirm or verify your identity and for security purposes, before processing and/or honoring your request.
