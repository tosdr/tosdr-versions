**Last updated:** June 11, 2024 

  

**WELCOME TO FOOTAGE FIRM, INC.’S (“FOOTAGE FIRM”) FAMILY OF WEBSITES, INCLUDING STORYBLOCKS.COM, VIDEOBLOCKS.COM, AUDIOBLOCKS.COM, GRAPHICSTOCK.COM, AND ANY OTHER WEBSITES OF FOOTAGE FIRM, ITS AFFILIATES, OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, “PLATFORM”). FOOTAGE FIRM ALLOWS USERS (“YOU” OR “USER”) TO ACCESS CERTAIN VISUAL AND AUDIO MEDIA CONTENT FROM THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, GRAPHICS, PICTURES, VIDEO CLIPS, FONT FILES, AUDIO CLIPS, AND OTHER MEDIA CONTENT (COLLECTIVELY, “STOCK FILES”). YOUR USE OF ANY STOCK FILES ARE GOVERNED BY A SEPARATE ROYALTY FREE LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND FOOTAGE FIRM (“LICENSE AGREEMENT”). THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (“TERMS”) REPRESENT A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND FOOTAGE FIRM. BY ACCESSING THE PLATFORM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. THESE TERMS INCLUDE OUR** [**PRIVACY POLICY**](https://www.storyblocks.com/privacy)**, WHICH IS INCORPORATED INTO THESE TERMS BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, INCLUDING OUR PRIVACY POLICY, AND ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE THE PLATFORM.** 

  

**REGISTRATION** 

Registering Your Account. In order to access certain features of the Platform, you may be required to become a Registered User. For purposes of these Terms, “**Registered** **User**” is a user who has registered an account on the Platform (“**Account**”).  

  

Registration Data. In registering for the Platform, you agree to (i) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Platform registration form (“**Registration** **Data**”); and (ii) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Footage Firm has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Footage Firm may suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Footage Firm Content (defined below) and/or the Platform (or any portion thereof). You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or information, or on behalf of someone other than yourself. Footage Firm reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to, claims by a third party that a username violates the third party's rights. You agree not to create an Account or use the Footage Firm Content and/or the Platform if you have been previously removed by Footage Firm, or if you have been previously banned from the Platform.

  

Password Protection and Security

Portions of the Platform are password protected for only Registered Users who have received an authorized password from Footage Firm and only those who are using their own unique password are permitted to access such portions of the Platform. **A condition of accessing the Platform is that you shall not divulge, upload, rent, sell, loan or exchange your password with any other person regardless of whether such person is another employee or subcontractor engaged by you or your employer or otherwise.** If you become aware of any loss, theft or misuse of your password, you must inform us in writing immediately, otherwise you may be liable for any loss or damage arising from such misuse. We reserve the right to terminate your access in the event of any misuse of your password.

  

  

**OWNERSHIP** 

Footage Firm Content. Except with respect to User Content (defined below), all elements of the Platform, including the general design, as well as all text, still images, moving images, graphics, illustrations, audio, multi-media, vectors, software, data and the selection and arrangement of those elements and any Stock Files incorporated therein (collectively, “**Footage** **Firm** **Content**”) are owned by Footage Firm or its licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark, trade dress, moral rights and other US and international laws or treaties relating to intellectual property. You must enter into a License Agreement to use any of the Stock Files. You may not use Footage Firm’s trademarks or trade names, including without Footage Firm’s prior written consent. In addition, the look and feel of the Platform, including all elements of the design is the service mark, trademark and/or trade dress of Footage Firm and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without our prior written permission. All other trademarks, registered trademarks, product names, logos, and User Content mentioned or displayed on the Platform are the property of their respective owners. Reference to any products, services, processes or other information, by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier or otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation by Footage Firm.

  

User Content. You acknowledge and agree that you are entirely responsible for all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available through the Platform (“**User** **Content**”, and together with the Footage Firm Content, “**Content**”). User Content excludes Stock Files you provide to Footage Firm under a License Agreement. You acknowledge that Footage Firm has no obligation to pre-screen User Content, although Footage Firm reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or remove any User Content. By entering into these Terms, you hereby provide your irrevocable consent to such monitoring and recording. You acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of your User Content, including without limitation chat, text, or voice communications. 

  

License to User Content; User Name. By submitting User Content, which shall include your username, to any “public area” of the Platform, you grant Footage Firm a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, and fully sublicensable right (including any moral rights) and license to use, license, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works form, distribute, derive revenue or other remuneration from, and communicate to the public, perform and display your User Content (in whole or in part) and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or later developed, for the full term of any worldwide intellectual property right that may exist in your User Content. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, by submitting User Content to any forums, comments or any other area on the Platform, you hereby expressly permit Footage Firm to identify you by your username (which may be a pseudonym) as the contributor of your User Content in any publication in any form, media or technology now known or later developed in connection with your User Content.

  

**USE OF THE PLATFORM** 

Modification of Terms. By using the Platform, you represent that you are over eighteen (18) and have the authority and right to agree to these Terms. If you are accessing the Platform on behalf of an entity, you further represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these terms on such entity's behalf and that such entity agrees to indemnify Footage Firm for violations of these Terms. Footage Firm reserves the right to alter, modify or update these Terms at any time and you agree to be bound by such modifications, alterations or updates. In using the Platform and any Content, you represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to the internet, data, e-mail, privacy, and the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside. Footage Firm reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to revoke your authorization to view, download and use the Footage Firm Content and information available on the Platform at any time and for any reason, with or without notice to you of such revocation, and you agree to immediately discontinue such use upon notice from Footage Firm. 

  

Video Editing Software Services. If you access the video editing and modification software tools available on the Platform (“**Video** **Editing** **Software**”), you are hereby granted a non-exclusive license to use the Video Editing Software for editing/modifying User Content, and subject to the terms of an applicable License Agreement, Footage Firm Content, that may be utilized, now and in the future, for any project, commercial or otherwise, including feature films, broadcast, educational, print, multimedia, games, merchandise, and the internet, subject to and contingent upon your compliance with these Terms. Subject to these Term sand the payment of any fees that we may charge you under the applicable License Agreement, Footage Firm will not charge an additional royalty or seek an additional payment from you with respect to the actual commercial exploitation of Content that you edit or modify with the Video Editing Software. 

  

The license provided under these Terms for the Video Editing Software is a single-seat, individual license (the “**Video** **Editor** **License**”). We may also offer multi-seat licenses on the Platform, which cover more than one individual at once. However, because the Video Editor License is intended to support everyday creators, no more than five (5) employees of any single, for-profit enterprise (including all parent, subsidiary, and affiliated companies) can be covered by the Video Editor License, regardless of whether such employees are on a team license or spread across individual licenses. If your company needs more than five (5) employees to be licensed to use the Video Editor License, you will need a separate Enterprise Agreement. Please contact our Enterprise Team at [enterprise@storyblocks.com](mailto:enterprise@storyblocks.com) to learn more.

A delay on the part of Footage Firm in the exercise of its rights or remedies will not operate as a waiver of such rights or remedies.
