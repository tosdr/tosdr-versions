If you wish to participate in any Studio Competition, you are responsible for reading and ensuring that you understand the applicable rules and any eligibility requirements and are lawfully able to participate in that Studio Competition in your place of residence.
13. **No Offsite Communications.** You must not use the Interactive Services to arrange face-to-face meetings outside the Website with any studio or other user, including exchanging money or other consideration for sex or companionship. We prohibit any form of interaction with a studio outside of the Website or the Interactive Services. If you do, you do so at your own risk, and we will not be liable to you for anything that happens outside of the Website with any studio or other user you meet on the Website.
14. **Changes to the Website.** We may update the Materials on this Website from time to time, but the Website’s Materials are not necessarily complete or up to date. The Website’s Materials may be out of date at any given time, and we are not required to update those Materials.
15. **Information About You and Your Visits to the Website.** For information about how we collect, use, and share your personal information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.clips4sale.com/clips/page/privacypolicy).
16. **Terms of Sale**
    1. **In General.** The Website is a marketplace that allows you to buy access to certain content from third-party studios who operate stores on the Website. All transactions and interactions facilitated by us are contracts between you and the studio. Although we facilitate transactions and interactions between customers and studios by providing the Website, storing content, and acting as a payment intermediary, we are not a party to any contract between a customer and a studio. We are not responsible for any transactions or interactions between customers and studios. Studios are solely responsible for determining (within the parameters for pricing on the Website) the pricing applicable to transactions and interactions and the content to which you may be given access or buy. Pricing excludes any taxes, and currency transmission charges, which are extra costs charged to you. For purposes of this section 16.1, “**customer**” means a user who buys content or services from a studio or gives the studio a tip or tribute.
    2. **Clip Cash**
        1. **Acquisition and Use.** You can prepay an amount to us (known as “**Clip Cash**”) using a Clip Cash Card bought through [www.clipcash.com](http://www.clipcash.com/) that you can later use to make Customer Payments. For purposes of this agreement, “**Customer Payment**” means any payment made by you to a studio, including payments to buy digital content; to buy custom content; any tips or tributes paid by you to the studio; and for any other paid features available now or in the future. You cannot split purchases on the Website between different payment methods. If you attempt a purchase that costs more than the total amount of your remaining Clip Cash, your transaction will be declined. Clip Cash is subject to a maximum amount as determined by us from time to time. Interest will not accrue on Clip Cash. Clip Cash is nonrefundable and nontransferable, except in the case of a refund of the funds loaded within six months of the date of loading. Clip Cash does not constitute a personal property right, has no value outside the Website, and can only be used to make Customer Payments via the Website. Clip Cash has no cash value and is not exchangeable for cash.
        2. **Forfeiture.** We may deduct a service fee from your Clip Cash if no Transaction Activity is detected on your account for 365-consecutive days. “**Transaction Activity**” means any action that uses Clip Cash, such as buying content or tipping a studio. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you via email before deducting Clip Cash from your account. On determining that there has been no Transaction Activity on your account for 365-consecutive days, every 30 days afterward, we will deduct the lesser of 1% of the Clip Cash in your account and $10 as a service fee for maintaining your Clip Cash account. To avoid deduction of your Clip Cash, all you have to do is log in to the Website and use any of your Clip Cash. When you use your Clip Cash, we will stop making further deductions of Clip Cash from your account. However, you will not be entitled to restoration of any Clip Cash that we have previously deducted from your account. If we terminate your account for breach of this agreement or you close your account, you will lose any accumulated Clip Cash. Clip Cash that is deemed unclaimed property may be turned over to the applicable authority.
    3. **Tipping/Tributes.** You may tip or give studios tributes through their store. You acknowledge the following about tipping:
        1. You tip or make a tribute at your option and risk.
        2. Tipping/tributes is not required to use the Website.
        3. Studios must not solicit tips/tributes by any means of payment other than through the Website.
        4. Tips/tributes are a voluntary gratuity and must not be given in exchange for specific services. Promising to tip or make a tribute in exchange for performing any specific act is prohibited. This conduct will result in an immediate and lifetime ban from the Website.
        5. Tips/tributes are chargeable when made. We will not return a tip/tribute made from your account except in situations that we consider, in our sole discretion, to be extraordinary.
    4. **Payment.** We accept payment through our payment processor via the payment methods identified on the Website at checkout. You must have a valid accepted form of payment to make a purchase. You must comply with any relevant terms or other legal agreement that governs your use of your chosen payment method. You authorize us to supply your payment card details to a third-party payment processor to process your payment. Prices may change at any time, and we do not offer price protection or refunds in case of a price reduction or promotional offering. Your payment card provider may charge you currency conversion fees. We do not control currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your payment card provider or bank. We are not responsible for paying any charges or fees imposed by your payment card provider or bank. It is your responsibility to check the price before making a purchase. We will charge your payment method for the price listed along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees, and currency fluctuations.
    5. **Taxes.** You are responsible for applicable federal, national, state, provincial, or local sales or use taxes, value-added taxes (VAT), or similar taxes or fees payable with your purchase. If you do not pay those taxes or fees on a transaction, you will be responsible for those taxes or fees if they are later found to be payable on that sale, and we may collect those taxes or other fees from you at any time. If we must collect or pay any taxes with your purchase, we will charge you those taxes at the time of each purchase transaction.
    6. **Refunds.** All sales and transactions are final. Payments are nonrefundable and fully earned on receipt. There are no refunds or credits for unused Clip Cash. If you are unhappy with a transaction with a studio, please inform that studio. If there is a technical error on the Website, we will work with you to resolve it. We may approve a refund in the form of a credit on request if exceptional circumstances exist. If you believe exceptional circumstances exist for a refund, please [Contact Us](https://www.clips4sale.com/clips/page/support) and explain the circumstances you think merit a refund. We are not making any promise that we or any studio will offer you a refund. If we issue a refund at our sole discretion, we will issue that refund in the form of either a credit to your Clip Cash balance or the payment method you used for your purchase. We will not make refunds in the form of cash, check, or free services. The provision of a refund in one instance does not entitle you to a refund in the future for similar instances, nor does it require us to issue refunds in the future under any circumstance. **This section 16.6 does not affect any statutory right to receive a refund that you may have under the Consumer Rights Act of 2015 or any other applicable law, except that you do not have the right to a refund for (a) digital products after you have started to download or stream these; or (b) sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software, once these products are unsealed after you receive them.**
    7. **Billing Errors.** If you believe that we have charged you in error, you must notify us in writing no later than 30 days after receiving the billing statement in which the error first appeared. If you do not let us know in writing within this period, you waive any disputed charges. You may submit any billing disputes by email to us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.clips4sale.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or use one of the other [contact methods](https://www.clips4sale.com/clips/page/support) listed on the Website. Please include a detailed statement describing the nature and amount of the disputed charges. We will correct any mistakes in a bill and add or credit them against your future payments.

        1. Errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies in the Materials (including User Contributions).

19. **Exclusion of Damages; Exclusive Remedy**
    1. Unless caused by its gross negligence or intentional misconduct, the Company, its directors, officers, employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, content providers, and service providers will not be liable to you for any direct, indirect, special (including so-called consequential damages), statutory, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or relating to your access or your inability to access the Website or the Materials. This exclusion applies regardless of the theory of liability, and even if you told us about the possibility of those damages, or we knew or should have known about the possibility of those damages.
    2. The Company, its directors, officers, employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, content providers, and service providers will not be liable to you for any damages for (1) personal injury, (2) pain and suffering, (3) emotional distress, (4) loss of revenue, (5) loss of profits, (6) loss of business or anticipated savings, (7) loss of use, (8) loss of goodwill, (9) loss of data, (10) loss of privacy, or (11) computer failure related to your access of or your inability to access the Website or the Materials. This exclusion applies regardless of the theory of liability, and even if you told us about the possibility of those damages, or we knew or should have known about the possibility of those damages.
    3. If you are dissatisfied with the Website or have any other complaint, your exclusive remedy is to terminate your account (if you have one) and stop using the Website. The Company’s and its directors, officers, employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, content providers, and service providers’ maximum liability to you for any claim will not exceed the greater of $200 and the amount you have paid for the applicable purchase out of which liability arose, even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
20. **Scope of Disclaimers, Exclusions, and Limitations.** The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations stated in sections 17, 18, and 19 apply to the greatest extent allowed by law, but no more. We do not intend to deprive you of any mandatory protections provided to you by law. Because some jurisdictions may prohibit the disclaimer of some warranties, excluding some damages, or other matters, one or more of the disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations will not apply to you.
21. **Indemnification**
    1. **In General.** You will pay the Company, its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, content providers, and service providers (collectively, “**Indemnified Parties**”) for any loss of an Indemnified Party that is caused by any of the following: (a) your access of, or conduct on, the Website, including your User Contributions; (b) your conduct offline; (c) your breach of this agreement; (d) your dispute with any other user, including any studio; (e) your violation of rights of any person, including intellectual property, publicity, and privacy rights; (f) your violation of any applicable law; (g) your tortious acts or omissions; or (h) your criminal acts or omissions. But you are not required to pay if the Indemnified Party’s intentional misconduct caused the loss.
    2. **Definitions.** “**Loss**” means an amount that the Indemnified Party is legally responsible for or pays in any form. Amounts include, for example, a judgment, a settlement, a fine, damages, injunctive relief, staff compensation, a decrease in property value, and expenses for defending against a claim for a loss (including fees for legal counsel, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss can be tangible or intangible; can arise from bodily injury, property damage, or other causes; can be based on tort, breach of contract, or any other theory of recovery; and includes incidental, direct, and consequential damages. A loss is “**caused by**” an event if the loss would not have happened without the event, even if the event is not a proximate cause of the loss.
    3. **Indemnified Party’s Duty to Notify You.** If the Indemnified Party has your contact information, the Indemnified Party will notify you before the 30th day after the Indemnified Party knows or should reasonably have known of a claim for a loss that you might be compelled to pay. But the Indemnified Party’s failure to give you timely notice does not end your obligation, except if that failure prejudices your ability to defend or mitigate losses.
    4. **Legal Defense of a Claim.** The Indemnified Party has control over defending a claim for a loss (including settling it) unless the Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense. If the Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense, you will not settle any litigation without the Indemnified Party’s written consent if the settlement (1) imposes a penalty or limitation on the Indemnified Party, (2) admits the Indemnified Party’s fault, or (3) does not fully release the Indemnified Party from liability. You and the Indemnified Party will cooperate in good faith on a claim.
    5. **No Exclusivity.** The Indemnified Parties’ rights under this section 21 do not affect other rights they might have.
22. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**
    1. **Governing Law**
        1. **If you reside inside the EEA/UK**, Cyprus law (including its statutes of limitations) governs all matters arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles.
        2. **If you reside outside the EEA/UK**, Delaware law (including its statutes of limitations) governs all matters arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles.
        3. This agreement’s predominant purpose is providing services and licensing access to intellectual property and not a “sale of goods.” The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not govern this agreement, the application of which is expressly excluded.
    2. **Jurisdiction**
        1. **If you reside inside the EEA/UK**, all disputes arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement that are not subject to alternative dispute resolution will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of competent jurisdiction located in Cyprus, and each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of those courts to resolve those disputes. Each party hereby waives any right to seek another forum or venue because of improper or inconvenient forum.
        2. **If you reside outside the EEA/UK**, all disputes arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement that are not subject to arbitration will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or any state court of competent jurisdiction in New Castle County, Delaware, and each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of those courts to resolve those disputes. Each party waives any right to seek another forum or venue because of an improper or inconvenient forum.
23. **Alternative Dispute Resolution**
    1. **ADR/Arbitration**
        1. **EEA/UK Users.** Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we have handled any complaint, you may want to contact the alternative dispute resolution provider we use. If you are located inside the EEA/UK, you can submit a complaint to the Cyprus Consumer Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution via its website at [http://www.adrcyprus.com/](http://www.adrcyprus.com/), the Cyprus Technical Chamber (ETEK) Alternative Dispute Resolution Centre (ETEK ADR Centre) via its website at [http://www.etek.org.cy/](http://www.etek.org.cy/), or the Interdisciplinary Centre for Law, Alternative and Innovative Methods (ICLAIM) via its website at [http://www.iclaimcentre.org/](http://www.iclaimcentre.org/). Each of these providers charges a fee for making a complaint and if you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can still bring legal proceedings under section 22.2(a). In addition, please note that disputes also may be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution platform ([ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm)).
        2. **Non-EEA/UK Users—Arbitration.** If you are located outside the EEA/UK, all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement are to be settled by binding arbitration with Arbitration Resolution Services, Inc. (ARS) (or a similar online dispute resolution provider if ARS is unavailable). The parties will abide by all rules of ARS, as found on its website at [www.arbresolutions.com](http://www.arbresolutions.com/). The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforceability, or formation of this agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable. Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. The arbitrator may grant whatever relief that would be available in a court at law or in equity, except that the arbitrator must not award punitive or exemplary damages or damages otherwise limited or excluded in this agreement. The arbitrator’s award will include costs of arbitration, reasonable legal fees, and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses. Judgment on any award rendered in any such arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Unless required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator will disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this agreement without the parties’ prior written consent.
    2. **Injunctive Relief.** The parties acknowledge that breach by either party of their obligations under this agreement could cause irreparable harm for which damages would be an inadequate remedy. Nothing in this section 23 prevents either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Website, in each case without posting a bond or other security and without proof of actual money damages in connection with the claim.
    3. **Recovery of Expenses.** In any proceedings between the parties arising out of this agreement or relating to the subject matter of this agreement, the Prevailing Party will be entitled to recover from the other party, besides any other relief awarded, all expenses that the Prevailing Party incurs in those proceedings, including legal fees and expenses. For purposes of this section 23.3, “**Prevailing Party**” means, for any proceeding, the party in whose favor an award is rendered, except that if in those proceedings the award finds in favor of one party on one or more claims or counterclaims and in favor of the other party on one or more other claims or counterclaims, neither party will be the Prevailing Party. If any proceedings are voluntarily dismissed or are dismissed as part of the settlement of that dispute, neither party will be the Prevailing Party in those proceedings.
    4. **Jury Trial Waiver.** Each party waives its right to a jury trial in proceedings arising out of or relating to this agreement. Either party may enforce this waiver up to and including the first day of trial.
    5. **Class Action Waiver.** All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator will not consolidate more than one person’s claims. Both parties acknowledge that each party is waiving the right to participate in a class action.
    6. **Limitation on Time to Bring Claims.** A party will not file a claim arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Any claim brought after one year is barred.
24. **General**
    1. **Entire Agreement.** This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us about your use of the Website and supersedes all earlier or contemporaneous agreements between you and us about the Website. Any additional terms on the Website will govern the items to which they pertain.
    2. **Changes.** We may change this agreement on one or more occasions. We will post changes on the Website at least 15 days before they become effective (“**Effective Date**”). Changes will become effective on the Effective Date stated at the top of this page. Changes will not apply to ongoing disputes or disputes arising from or relating to events before the Effective Date. While we will try to notify you when we change this agreement, we do not assume any obligation to do so, and it is your responsibility to check this page to review the most current agreement frequently. You agree to the revised agreement by using the Website after the Effective Date. If you do not agree to the revised agreement, your exclusive remedy is to stop accessing the Website before the Effective Date. If you need more information about the changes or have any other questions or comments, please emails us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.clips4sale.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
    3. **Assignment and Delegation.** We may assign our rights or delegate any performance under this agreement without your consent. You must not assign your rights or delegate your performance under this agreement without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment of rights or delegation of performance in breach of this section 24.3 is void.
    4. **Waiver.** If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this agreement, it will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of this agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by the relevant party.
    5. **Severability.** If any part of this agreement is declared unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable.
    6. **Notices**
        1. **Notice to Us.** You may give notice to us by email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.clips4sale.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) unless the Website specifies a different email address for giving notice. We may change our contact information on one or more occasions by posting the change on the Website. Please check the Website for the most current information for notifying us.
        2. **Notice to You—Electronic Notice.** You consent to receive any notice from us in electronic form either (1) by email to the last known email address we have for you or (2) by posting the notice on a place on the Website chosen for this purpose. You state that any email address you gave us for contacting you is a current and valid email address for receiving notice.
    7. **Force Majeure.** We are not responsible for any failure to perform if unforeseen circumstances or causes beyond our reasonable control delays or continues to delay our performance, including (a) acts of God, including fire, flood, earthquakes, hurricanes, tropical storms, or other natural disasters; (b) war, riot, arson, embargoes, acts of civil or military authority, or terrorism; (c) fiber cuts; (d) strikes or shortages in transportation, facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials; (e) failure of the telecommunications or information services infrastructure; and (f) hacking, SPAM, or any failure of a computer, server, network, or software.
    8. **Relationship of the Parties.** This agreement does not, and the parties do not intend it to, create a partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, or employment relationship. The parties expressly disclaim the existence of any of these relationships. Neither party is the agent for the other, and neither party has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a third party.
    9. **Electronic Communications Not Private.** We do not provide facilities for sending or receiving confidential electronic communications. You should consider all messages sent to or from us as open communications readily accessible to the public. You should not use the Website to send or receive messages you only intend the sender and named recipients to read. Users or operators of the Website may read all messages you send to or through the Website regardless of whether they are the intended recipients.
    10. **Electronic Signatures.** Any affirmation, assent, or agreement you send through the Website will bind you. When you click on an “I agree,” “I consent,” or other similarly worded “button” or entry field with your mouse, keystroke, or other device, your agreement or consent will be legally binding and enforceable and the legal equivalent of your handwritten signature.
