Login.gov is committed to your privacy and security
---------------------------------------------------

This describes how we ask for, use, retain, and protect your personal information. Protecting your information is our priority at Login.gov.

The information that you submit is used to create or update your Login.gov account and give you access to Login.gov’s partner agencies. When you provide your email address or other proof of identity like a state ID, we can be sure it’s really you and grant you access to the account — and keep the bad actors away. This proof, called an electronic identity assurance credential, is like putting a key into a lock to securely open the door to the government agency’s application or service.

### How we work with our partner agencies:

* Login.gov partners with government agencies to provide secure access to their website, application, or service. The partner agency (for example, the United States Office of Personnel Management) selects the type of information we request from you.
* We ask primarily for information to authenticate your account and/or prove your identity.
* When you create a Login.gov account, you consent to share personally identifiable information (PII). The information that you need to share depends on the request of the partner agency.
* For authentication to establish a secure account, we need your name, email address, and an authentication method. Your authentication method could be a phone number where we share an SMS code, USB Security Key, or other options.
* Identity proofing requires more sensitive information such as a social security number, address, phone number, and U.S.-based state ID or driver’s license. A self-photograph is needed in cases where partners require verification through biometric comparison as further proof of your identity. Biometric comparison involves comparing your self-photograph to the portrait on your government-issued ID card.
* When completing identity proofing in person at the United State Postal Service (USPS) Office, we share your validated name and address with USPS so that clerks can confirm your identity in person.
* When you visit Login.gov, we anonymously aggregate some data, which means that no individually identifying information is attached to it. We aggregate the pages visited, web browser type and version, and the length of the session to help us improve the Login.gov experience.For example, if you experience an error and we know your web browser type and version, we can better identify how to fix your issue.
* Your stored account information is encrypted at two levels. Encryption translates your data into code that is only accessible by you, the Login.gov account holder. This means you are the only one who can view and make changes to your account information.
* The Login.gov operators (that is, our contact help center) cannot view your information or make any changes.

Protecting your information is our priority. You can read more detailed explanations about [how Login.gov works](https://login.gov/policy/how-does-it-work/), and [our privacy act statement](https://login.gov/policy/our-privacy-act-statement/).
