PLEASE READ THE TERMS & CONDITIONS OF THIS USER AGREEMENT(“Terms”), elsewhere known as Terms and Conditions, and/or Registration Terms, CAREFULLY. By accessing and using this and other websites, online services and mobile applications of POSCON Inc., a non-profit organization, and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively referred to as “POSCON”, “us”, “our”, or “we”), including without limitation [www.poscon.net](http://poscon.net/), and other websites and mobile applications linking to these Terms (collectively, the “Sites”) and/or the use of any products or services offered through the Sites (“Products” and “Services”, respectively), you agree to be bound by these Terms, and you confirm that you are at least 13 years old. If you do not agree to all these Terms or you are under the age of 13, you must refrain from accessing and using the Sites. If you are between 13 and 16 years of age, you may only use the Sites with the consent and supervision of a parent or guardian. Parental consent occurs when the parent or guardian of a minor between the ages of 13 and 16 grants permission for such minor to use the Sites under supervision, and agrees on behalf of himself/herself and the minor to all of these Terms.

These Terms set out your rights and responsibilities when you visit the Sites, and are between you (sometimes referred to as “you” or “your”) and POSCON.

2. Use, and permit to be used, such Physical Likeness in the advertising, marketing, and/or publicizing of the Sites in any media; and
3. Use, and permit to be used, such User’s name and identity in connection with the Sites.

Each User hereby waives all rights and releases POSCON from, and shall neither sue nor bring any proceeding against any such parties for, any claim or cause of action, whether now known or unknown, for defamation, invasion of right to privacy, publicity or personality or any similar matter, or based upon or relating to the use and exploitation of such User’s Physical Likeness in connection with the Sites. Each User acknowledges that POSCON shall not owe any financial or other remuneration for using the Physical Likeness provided hereunder by such User, either for initial or subsequent transmission or playback, and further acknowledges that POSCON is not responsible for any expense or liability incurred as a result of such User’s Physical Likeness or participation in any recordings, including any loss of such recording data.

**e. Your Content:**  
Any information and materials you provide to POSCON in connection with the use of Products and/or Services or your registration for the Sites, any change or update made to your account information, and all other postings, text, images, messages, files, and/or other materials you post, transmit through, or link to the Sites (collectively, “Your Content”) are your sole responsibility. POSCON and the Sites merely provide a means for the transmission and dissemination of Your Content. POSCON acts merely as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of Your Content. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL EVALUATE AND BEAR ALL RISK RELATED TO THE USE OF OR ANY ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF YOUR CONTENT. THE RESULTS OF ANY ACTIONS YOU TAKE BASED ON YOUR CONTENT OR OTHER CONTENT YOU FIND ON THE SITES ARE SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL POSCON BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR YOUR CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM YOUR CONTENT OR YOUR ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITES.

We do not pre-screen or approve Your Content and we have no obligation to monitor Your Content. However, we reserve the right to review, modify, monitor, distribute, refuse to post, or delete any of Your Content at our sole discretion. We reserve the right at all times and in our sole discretion to disclose any information we believe necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. By uploading, transmitting, or posting Your Content, you grant to us a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, print, display, reproduce, modify, store, edit, publish, post, transmit, prepare derivative works, delete and distribute Your Content in whole or in part in connection with the Sites and to promote POSCON, the Products and Services, and the Sites in general.

**f. Your Account:**  
If you are permitted to and choose to create an account on the Sites, you are the only person authorized to access and use your account. You will not give your username, password, or any other account information to a third party. You must immediately notify us of any known or suspected unauthorized use of your account or any known or suspected breach of security, including, but not limited to loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ACTIVITY ON YOUR ACCOUNT. Any fraudulent, misleading, abusive, or illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your account at our sole discretion and we may refer you to appropriate law enforcement agencies. You agree to maintain accurate and complete contact information in connection with your account, and to update this information promptly in the event it changes.

4. Reviews may not contain private information, obscene, racist, or harassing language or imagery, or advertising or spam; and
5. Reviews may not be about things outside of POSCON’s control.

Extortion is not allowed on POSCON. Any attempt to manipulate reviews through threats, intimidation, or bribery is considered extortion and is strictly prohibited. Shilling is also not allowed on POSCON. Not only does it violate our core value of transparency, but it is considered to be a deceptive business practice by the US Federal Trade Commission. Reviews must reflect the honest, unbiased opinions, findings, beliefs, or experience of the User.

**a. USE OF THE SITES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.**  
_Sites Disclaimer._ THE SITES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “WHERE IS,” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. USE OF THE SITES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. POSCON DOES NOT WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, NOR DOES POSCON MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY OF ANY CONTENT OR AS TO ANY RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED BY USE OF THE SITES. POSCON MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARISING BY VIRTUE OF CUSTOM OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING, OR TIMELINESS, IN RELATION TO THE SITES. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND ALL ACTS OR OMISSIONS TAKEN IN RELIANCE ON THE SITES OR ANY INFORMATION THEREIN, INCLUDING INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE INFORMATION. ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED ARE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY, AND OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS MAY BE GRANTED IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS. PLEASE NOTE THAT NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SITES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

_Product & Service Disclaimer._ THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITES, MAY NOT BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES USED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED FROM POSCON ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. STATEMENTS OUTSIDE THE TERMS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, STATEMENTS REGARDING SUITABILITY FOR USE, WHETHER MADE BY OUR EMPLOYEES OR OTHERWISE, ARE NOT WARRANTIES OR PROMISES BY US, AND WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY SUCH STATEMENTS. **YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.** SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY, AND OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS MAY BE GRANTED IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS.

**b. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY**  
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THE SITES, SITE-RELATED CONTENT OR ANY LINKED WEBSITE. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS THE REFUND/RETURN OF SUCH PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SITES, ANY SITE CONTENT, OR ANY LINKED WEBSITES IS TO STOP USING THE SITES, SITE CONTENT, OR LINKED WEBSITES.

IF WE ARE FOUND TO BE LIABLE DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS ABOVE, IN NO EVENT SHALL POSCON BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATING TO PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR THESE TERMS IN AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE AGGREGATE NET PURCHASE PRICE YOU PAID, IF ANY, FOR THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

**c. RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION**  
By purchasing and using any Products or Services obtained through the Sites, and/or otherwise using the Sites, you agree to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless POSCON and its officers, members, directors, employees, affiliates, contractors, licensors and agents, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses or expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs and expenses, arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of all or part of the Sites; (b) Your Content; (c) a breach or alleged breach by you of any of your representations, warranties, covenants or obligations within these Terms; (d) your infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property or other rights of POSCON or third parties; (e) any negligence or willful misconduct by you; (f) any claims of personal injury, death, loss or damages arising from or in connection with any Products or Services; or (g) your interaction with any other User. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

**d. INFRINGEMENT**  
It is POSCON’s policy to respect the intellectual property of others and to respond quickly to notices of alleged infringement. POSCON will terminate the access of all Users who infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Likewise, any apparent infringement of POSCON’s intellectual property rights by any User will result in the immediate termination of that User’s access to the Sites.

If POSCON removes or disables access to User Content or Third Party Content according to these Terms, POSCON may, in its discretion, provide the Content Contributor with a copy of the notification which prompted removal or disabled access to the User Content or Third Party Content. However, POSCON reserves the right to withhold access to and/or not replace the User Content or Third Party Content unless ordered to do so by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction.
