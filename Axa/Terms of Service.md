Making a complaint
------------------

AXA aims to provide the highest standard of service to every customer.

If our service does not meet your expectations we want to hear about it so we can try to put things right.

All complaints we receive are taken seriously. Following the steps below will help us understand your concerns and give you a fair response.

We will aim to resolve your complaint as quickly as possible. If we can’t find a resolution within 3 days of you registering a complaint and we need to make further enquiries, we will:

* Provide a written acknowledgment of your complaint within five working days of receipt.
* Provide details outlining our process and how you can contact us.

In these circumstances, we aim to resolve your complaint as quickly as we can. However, if we are unable to do this within eight weeks, we will write explaining what is happening and when we expect to have an answer.

### How to make your complaint

The majority of complaints can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily by the department you are dealing with.

Telephone contact is often the most effective way to resolve complaints quickly.

Alternatively you can write to us.

When you make contact please tell us the following information

* Name address and postcode, telephone number and e-mail address (if you have one).
* Your policy and/or claim number, and the type of policy you hold.
* The name of your insurance agent/firm (if applicable).
* The reason for your complaint.

Any written correspondence should be headed ‘complaint’ and you may include copies of supporting material.

### Beyond AXA

Should you remain dissatisfied following our final written response, you may be eligible to refer your case to the Financial Ombudsman Service (hereafter referred to as the FOS).

The FOS is an independent body that arbitrates complaints in the Financial Services industry.

The FOS can only consider your complaint if we have given you our final decision.

You have six months from the date of our final response to refer your complaint to the FOS. This does not affect your right to take legal action.
