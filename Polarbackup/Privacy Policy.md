###### **General  
**

These Terms, which incorporate the Privacy Policy , Product Agreement ,and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), each of which you can access by clicking on these links or navigating the tabs above, constitute the entire understanding of the parties and supersede all prior and contemporaneous written and oral agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof. In particular, if you are a current licensee of Polar Backup Products, these Terms shall supersede your existing license agreement and that agreement shall be of no further force or effect. Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party will not be applied in the construction or interpretation of these Terms. As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” If one or more of the provisions herein shall be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforcement of the remaining provisions shall not be affected or impaired. The failure to enforce or the waiver by either party of a default or breach of the other party shall not be considered to be a waiver of any subsequent default or breach. If you or Polar Backup cannot perform its obligations under these Terms because of any act of God, accident, strike, court order, fire, riot, war, failure of third party equipment, or any other cause not within the affected party’s reasonable control and that could not be avoided through the exercise of reasonable care and diligence (a “Force Majeure Event”), then the non-performing party will: (i) promptly notify the other party; (ii) take reasonable steps to resume performance as soon as possible; and (iii) not be considered in breach during the duration of the Force Majeure Event. If a Force Majeure Event continues for five (5) or more business days, Polar Backup may terminate your subscription to the Polar Backup Products and these Terms by providing written notice to you. IT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT IN THE EVENT ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.

**

  
Your license to a Lifetime Plan of the Polarbackup Products will automatically terminate upon the earlier of (i) when the Polarbackup Product is no longer made available, (ii) when Polarbackup cancels your license to the Lifetime Plan, or (iii) when your computer has not accessed the Polarbackup server for more than ninety (90) calendar days. You acknowledge and agree that Polarbackup policy is to automatically delete all of your Backed-up Data upon meeting any of the above points and that it is solely your responsibility to seek another source for your backup needs.  

### **ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND MAINTENANCE PLANS**

###### **Lifetime License Storage and Additional Services**

  
While your Lifetime License guarantees perpetual storage of your backed-up data under the Polarbackup Products, we wish to clarify that this guarantee solely pertains to the storage of data. Access to and use of additional services, including but not limited to customer support, data restoration, and enhanced access features, may require an active subscription to one of our Maintenance Plans.  

###### **Maintenance Plans Subscription**

**Access to Support Services**: To benefit from our dedicated support services, users may need to subscribe to an appropriate Maintenance Plan. These support services include technical assistance, troubleshooting, and guidance on using Polarbackup Products.

**Data Restoration Services**: Restoring data from the Polarbackup storage may require a subscription to a Maintenance Plan. This ensures that users have the necessary support and resources to safely and efficiently restore their data whenever needed.

**Enhanced Features and Services**: From time to time, Polarbackup may introduce enhanced features, additional services, or improvements to the Polarbackup Products. Access to these enhancements may be exclusive to subscribers of our Maintenance Plans.

###### **Subscription Terms and Conditions**

**Subscription Requirement**: Subscription to a Maintenance Plan is optional and not required for maintaining your Lifetime License for data storage. However, access to the above-mentioned additional services is conditional upon maintaining an active subscription.

**Fees and Payments**: Details regarding the subscription fees, payment terms, and conditions for Maintenance Plans will be provided at the time of subscription. These terms may be subject to change, and subscribers will be notified of any such changes in accordance with our policies.

###### **Cancellation and Termination**

Subscribers may cancel their Maintenance Plan subscription at any time. However, it is important to understand that cancelling your Maintenance Plan will not only result in the loss of access to the additional services provided through the plan, but will also lead to the termination of your Lifetime License for data storage. This means that upon cancellation of the Maintenance Plan, your rights to store data under the Lifetime License will cease, and you will need to seek alternative arrangements for your backup needs. We strongly advise reviewing your backup and data storage strategy before making any decisions to cancel your Maintenance Plan to ensure continuity of your data storage solutions.

**Your Responsibility**

You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain an active subscription to a Maintenance Plan should you require access to the additional services, including support and data restoration. Polarbackup shall not be obligated to provide such services without an active Maintenance Plan subscription.
