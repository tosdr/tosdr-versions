4. **USE OF COOKIES**

We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, Google analytics and other tracking technologies on our Platform to help customize our services and improve your user experience. Cookies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser. Session cookies are only stored on your computer or mobile device while you use our Platform and are automatically deleted when you close your web browser or mobile application. If you are located in Canada, the United Kingdom, or the European Union, we will request your consent before storing session cookies. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the Spoutible Platform. When you access our Platform, your personal information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. You may not decline web beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or by modifying your web browser’s settings to notify you each time a cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. We use third-party session cookies provided by Cloudflare’s Bot Management technology to protect our Platform from harmful automated attacks. Additionally, we may at times include or offer third party products or services on our Platform. These third-party websites or software may use cookies or similar tracking technology to help manage and optimize your online experience with us.

Spoutible bears no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these third-party links or websites.

5. **INFORMATION STORAGE AND SECURITY**

The personal information collected and processed by Spoutible at our offices and data centres are held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the appropriate data protection laws as and where applicable.

All third parties are carefully screened before transfer of any personal information, so we can ensure that there are adequate controls in place and, where relevant, that such third parties are fully compliant with the applicable laws.
