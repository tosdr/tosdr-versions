We may offer memberships on a subscription basis to access certain Content or other Services (“**Memberships**”) for a recurring fee, and for access during a specific period time (“**Membership Period**”), in each case, as further described or disclosed to you when you subscribe to a Membership.

When you subscribe to a Membership, you expressly authorize Digital Trends (or our third-party payment processor) to charge the Membership fee to you on a recurring basis during the Membership Period.

You may cancel your Membership at any time on your profile page or by emailing us at memberships@digitaltrends.com. The cancellation will apply to the following Membership Period, and your Membership and access to any associated services will continue until the start of the following Membership Period. You will not receive a refund for the current month, nor will fees be prorated.

Until June 1, you will retain your access to the services. You will not receive a refund or proration for the remainder of the month.  
  
If the price of your Membership changes, Digital Trends will notify you at least ten (10) days in advance of the next billing date. If you do not want to pay the new Membership fee, you must cancel your Membership in accordance with these Terms.

Digital Trends reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services, or any features or portions thereof, without prior notice. You agree that Digital Trends will not be liable for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services, or any part thereof.  

14\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION  

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate disputes and claims with Digital Trends and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.  
  
Dispute Resolution. For any dispute or claim that you have against Digital Trends or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Digital Trends and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“**Notice**”) to Digital Trends by email at legal@digitaltrends.com or by certified mail addressed to 111 SW 5th Ave, Suite 1000, Portland, OR 97204. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above.  You agree that this dispute resolution process must be followed prior to you initiating any arbitration or filing a claim against Digital Trends.  
  
No Representative Actions. You and Digital Trends agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Digital Trends and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.  
  
Except for small claims disputes in which you or Digital Trends seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Digital Trends seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Digital Trends waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court.  
  
Arbitration of Disputes. If you and Digital Trends cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, both parties agree that any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the breach thereof, or the Services shall be settled by binding bilateral arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), except as modified by this Section 14.  You hereby consent to the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules where applicable, and, where applicable, the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules shall be included in the defined term “AAA Rules.” The most recent version of the AAA rules is available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) and are hereby incorporated by reference. All disputes submitted to AAA will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Multnomah County, Oregon or if your claim does not exceed $10,000 then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents you and Digital Trends submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the AAA Rules or waive your opportunity to read the AAA Rules and waive any claim that the AAA Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.  
  
Batch Arbitration. To promote efficient handling of arbitration claims, if twenty-five (25) or more substantially similar claims are filed against Digital Trends within reasonably close temporal proximity, by or with the help of an entity or coordinated group of entities, whether or not such claims are filed simultaneously, the AAA will promptly take steps to administer the claims in batches of twenty-five (25) (plus a final batch consisting of any remaining claims).  Each batch will be considered as a single consolidated arbitration and be appointed one arbitrator and with one set of filing and administrative fees per side, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any), and one final award.  The arbitrator will take other steps as necessary for a speedy and efficient resolution of the claims. Claims are of a “substantially similar nature" if they arise out of or relate to the same event or facts, raise similar legal issues and/or causes of action, and seek similar relief. If we disagree on whether this batch arbitration process applies, the AAA will appoint an arbitrator to decide that issue, whose fees will be paid by Digital Trends and who may prescribe procedures needed to resolve the disagreement. This batch arbitration process does not authorize a class, collective, consolidated, joint, or mass arbitration or action other than as may be set forth in this Section 14.  
  
You and Digital Trends agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.  
  
The arbitrator, Digital Trends, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.  
  
You and Digital Trends agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Digital Trends will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Digital Trends, Digital Trends will pay all AAA fees and costs.  However, if the arbitrator decides that either the substance of either party’s claim or the remedy either party asked for is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose, such party will be responsible for all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees and the other party’s attorneys’ fees. You and Digital Trends agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Oregon and the United States sitting in Multnomah County, Oregon have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.  
  
Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Digital Trends will not have the right to assert the claim.  
  
You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 14 by sending an email to legal@digitaltrends.com. To be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 15.  
  
If any portion of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 14 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 14; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 14 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 14 will be enforceable.  

15\. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE  

Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Oregon, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Oregon or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.  By using the Services, you explicitly consent to any and all claims between you and Digital Trends being subject to the substantive laws of Oregon, notwithstanding the venue in which a claim is brought, your place of residence and/or your physical location at the time you used the Services. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Oregon and the United States, respectively, sitting in Multnomah County, Oregon.  

16\. SEVERABILITY  

If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
