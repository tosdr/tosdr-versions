If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), and your personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will either process your information in a territory which the European Commission has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information, or implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including transferring it in accordance with applicable transfer mechanism, including the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses. Please see [European Resident Privacy Rights](#European-Privacy-Rights) for more information.
