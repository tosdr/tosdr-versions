Privacy Policy
==============

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you at [https://www.yidio.com/](https://www.yidio.com/ "Yidio") (the "Website") and Yidio applications and how we use this information.  
  
**Collection of your Yidio Information**  
  
Your "Yidio information" includes certain technical information gathered or received when you use Yidio. Some of the technical information that may be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), CPU type, your manner of connecting to the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband access); Internet protocol address; Apps Installed; information about the version of service from an affiliate that you used prior to registering with the service; other information about your geographic location; and the domain name of your Internet service provider.  
  
While registering to use most of the Yidio services is not required, there are a limited number of optional services (for example, saving a video list) that require an "account". Registration functionality for Yidio is provided by the Yidio Network. If you choose to "Register an Account", you will need to register with and provide information to Yidio. You will then obtain a Screen Name or other credential issued by Yidio (collectively, "Screen Name") in order to access and use these optional services, and your Screen Name and associated services account will be subject to the Yidio Terms of Service Agreement and Privacy Practices indicated in your registration process.  
  
  
**How Your Yidio information is Used**  
  
Your Yidio information is used  
  

* to operate and improve the websites, services and offerings available through Yidio;
* to personalize the content provided to you;
* to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services;
* to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries;
* to conduct research about your use of Yidio; and
* to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest.

  
Your Yidio information will not be shared with third parties unless it is necessary to fulfill a request, in other circumstances in which you have consented to the sharing of your Yidio information, or except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may use your Yidio information to present offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about groups of Yidio users, but do not receive information that personally identifies you.  
  
If you use our communications tools to disclose information about yourself publicly (for example, by making your screen name and/or video lists publicly available), other online users may obtain access to any information you provide. The contents of your online communications, as well as other information about you as a Yidio user, may be accessed and disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe Yidio is being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of our affiliated providers, or for us to render the service you have requested. We may use agents and contractors in order to help operate the service. If such agents and contractors have access to your Yidio information, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Yidio.  
  
In the event that ownership of us or the Yidio service was to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your Yidio information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your Yidio information, we will provide notice about the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer.  
  
**Your Choices About Your Information**  
  
If you want to change your account information (for example, your Screen Name) you will need to log onto Yidio and access your account through the forum. Your access to your account information and choice will be governed by the Yidio policies.
