For example, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, country,city and e-mail address). In some cases (for example, if you register with us (or sign-in on this Website), we may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, and a security question and answer.

In addition, as you (and other users) browse this Website, our web servers may automatically collect certain information about such visits (usually through the use of cookies, java script tags, clear .gif files (also known as “web beacons”), and the analysis of http headers), such as the user’s IP address, the user’s geographic location, the user’s domain name, the user’s browser type, the user’s user agent, how many users visit this Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses this Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to this Website and the links on this Website on which the user clicks.

If we collect such information, we may use it for a number of purposes, including:

* **To establish and maintain a commercial relationship with you and to provide you with products and services.** Account information may be retained by us to enable our website to identify you, to allow you to set up and access your account (if applicable) and to change your account information and/or services. This information is used only for these purposes and is only retained in transaction records required for internal management and auditing purposes, unless you are informed otherwise or you provide your consent or we are required to disclose same pursuant to a court order or other legal process.

* **To develop, enhance or provide new services.** We may from time to time conduct surveys and research, requesting input from our visitors to help us improve our website, products and services in an effort to serve you better.

However, your name, address, email and telephone number may be required to take advantage of bonuses or other benefits which are available to survey participants, in which case your contact information will only be used for notification and fulfillment purposes.

* **To manage and administer our business.** The nature of the Internet is such that it passively and automatically collects certain information about a user’s traffic patterns, which may be linked to their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. These are unique Internet “addresses” assigned to all Web users by their Internet Service Providers (ISP). Server logs record statistical information, such as visitors’ IP addresses, type of operating systems, time and duration of visit, web pages requested, and identify visitors by categories such as domains and browser types. These statistics are only used on an aggregate basis and will not contain any information that could identify you personally.

* **To meet legal, regulatory, security and processing requirements** (such as in response to a court order), and otherwise as permitted or required by law. We may also use this personal information to contact you regarding any such legal, regulatory, security, or processing requirements, and may be required to disclose this information pursuant to our Terms of Service.

If we intend to use personal information for purposes not identified to you or as set out above, these other purposes will be described to you at the time of collection or before using the information. We will not use your information or otherwise disclose it for any other purpose without your consent.

You should be aware that we cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers’ or third parties’ web sites that you may visit as a result of clicking on a link from our Website.

### VPN User Data

STARVPN employs a strict “no data collection” policy on all Residential Shared VPN, Private VPN, Rotating VPN and Static IP VPN Packages.  Our VPN server application – OpenVPN redirects standard system messages to log facility “0” (syslog) and will include client WAN IP connection status.  The data is not harvested or archived,   Standard Syslog retention period is one day,  the data is destroyed from the server on a nightly basis.

External connection tracking is completed disabled, since we allow unlimited data usage,  user upload/download activity is completely anonymous from source to destination network.   Internal Connection tracking is established via private IP addressing and redirect using ambiguous, non privileged Port numbers.

### Your Consent

Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information may be given in various ways. Consent can be express (e.g., orally, electronically or on a form you may sign describing the intended uses and disclosures of personal information) or implied (e.g., when you provide information necessary for a service you have requested, or in some circumstances where notice has been provided to you about our intentions with respect to your personal information and you have not withdrawn your consent for an identified purpose, such as by using an “opt out” option provided). Consent may be given by your authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or a person having a power of attorney). Generally, by providing us with personal information, we will assume that you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of such information for the purposes identified or described in this privacy policy, if applicable, or as otherwise described at the time of collection. You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use and disclosure of personal information at any time, subject to contractual and legal restrictions and reasonable notice, however, please note that if you withdraw your consent to certain uses of your personal information, we may no longer be able to provide certain of our products or services.
