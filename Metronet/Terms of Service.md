When we have processed your online sign-up registration, and received any Charges that are due from you, we will then provide you with the relevant Service.

5.1.1 You will need to provide certain Customer Equipment as specified to you by us including modem and connection Software.  
  
**5.2 For Broadband Products**  
  
5.2.1 Before we can be certain that we can provide you with the Service, we need to:  
  
5.2.1.1 successfully complete a line test and survey to demonstrate that we can effectively provide the Service to you; and

5.4 When Equipment is being installed at your Premises or your Service is being activated, the normal expectation is that you will be likely to lose your telephone service for between a few minutes and two hours. This is because your existing connection needs to be replaced to allow you to access the Service. You agree to a loss of telephone service in these circumstances, and we accept no liability for any loss arising from a loss of telephone service of any duration.  
  
**6\. Equipment**

6.2.4 You have to accept the Equipment when it is ready for delivery.  
  
6.2.5 Delivery is deemed to take place when the Equipment is delivered to your nominated address, whereupon the risks of loss, breakage and all damage and all other risks shall pass to you.  
  
6.2.6 Title in the Equipment does not pass to you until payment is received in full by us, or when the Service is activated where applicable.

6.2.7.1 re-arrange delivery provided that we may charge you for the additional delivery costs incurred.

6.2.7.3 store and insure the Equipment at your expense and risk.  
  
6.2.8 You may request a Proof of Delivery, provided that this request is made in writing through Contact Us tool within 3 months of the date of delivery and we shall use reasonable endeavours to provide such proof. Thereafter, delivery shall be deemed to have been successfully completed.

6.2.10.1 You may choose to retain the Equipment, in which case you are liable for the full price of the Equipment as specified on our website at the time the order was placed;  
  
6.2.10.2 You may choose to return the Equipment, in which case you will be responsible for shipping and associated costs incurred. The Equipment must be returned unopened and in perfect re-saleable condition. Any defacement of the producer's packaging or damage caused by inadequate packaging may result in the rejection of the return or an additional restocking fee, at our sole discretion;  
  
6.2.10.3 Any refunds for activation, Equipment and initial subscription may be adjusted to reflect any outstanding charges or damage to any returned Equipment; or  
  
6.2.10.4 We reserve the right to levy further charges if any Equipment is not returned or full payment received within 14 days of us notifying you of the failed activation.  
  
**6.3 Product specification:**  
  
6.3.1 We will make every effort to supply Equipment as advertised but we reserve the right to supply the Equipment subject to minor variations in actual dimensions, specifications and, in the case of bulk items, quantities, without prior notice.

In such a case, if you do not wish to accept the alternative Equipment offered, you may cancel the order and require the refund of any money paid to us in respect of that order. This shall be your sole remedy in these circumstances.  
  
**6.4 Trade names and trademarks:**

6.4.2 If no brand of Equipment is specified by us, and if you require a particular brand of Equipment you must check with us before placing an order to determine the brand of the Equipment you wish to purchase and specify in writing the brand you wish to purchase.

6.5.1 To enable the installation of the Equipment, you will, at your own expense:

We may agree to work outside our normal working hours, but you must pay any additional charges for doing so.  
  
6.5.5 Our personnel will observe your reasonable site regulations, as previously advised to us in writing through the Contact Us tool.

You will ensure that such employees, agents and contractors will themselves keep confidential, and not disclose to third parties, the Software and any operating manuals and other documentation supplied under the Agreement.  
  
6.6.3 You will not, without our prior consent, copy (except as permitted by law), de-compile or modify the Software in any way, nor copy the operating manuals or documentation.  
  
6.6.4 You will sign any agreement reasonably required by the owner of the copyright in the Software to protect the owner's interest in that Software.  
  
**6.7 Warranties and returns:**  
  
6.7.1 In the event that Equipment is found to be faulty or defective, we offer the returns facilities described below.  
  
6.7.2 All Equipment supplied by us is warranted to be generally free from defects in workmanship and materials and fit for the purpose for which such Equipment would normally be used, for a period of 12 months from the date of supply. Subject to this, however, Equipment is not tested or sold as being fit for any particular application or for use under specific conditions, unless expressly agreed in writing.  
  
6.7.3 We shall use our skill and expertise to carry out any contracted works ("Works") to a standard equivalent to that of a competent computer professional, and shall warrant our work as free from defects for a period of 30 days after completion of the Works. In particular, we cannot be held responsible for any fault or damage not caused by our or our nominated third party's personnel.  
  
6.7.4 In the event of a claim arising relating to the Works, we reserve, at our sole discretion, the right to appoint an independent expert in the field to appraise the work carried out in the execution of the Works. Additionally, we cannot be held responsible for Equipment installed or configured when the Equipment has subsequently been altered or configured by persons other than our personnel or the personnel of our nominated third parties.  
  
6.7.5 Except as expressly provided in this clause, all other express or implied terms or warranties relating to the Equipment or the Works are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.  
  
6.7.6 You must check suitability and specifications of Equipment before ordering.  
  
6.7.7 In the event that we, at our discretion (unless the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 apply), agree to accept the return for credit of unwanted Equipment, the Equipment must be returned with our prior written agreement through the Contact Us tool within 14 days of delivery. The Equipment must be unopened and in perfect re-saleable condition. All Equipment returned in these circumstances will be subject to a handling fee of 15% of our sale price for the Equipment, or £20, whichever is the greater.  
  
6.7.8 Subject to testing to verify any alleged fault, and subject to the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000, we will accept the return of defective Equipment for full refund or replacement at our option, if, but only if the Equipment is returned within 14 days of delivery.  
  
6.7.9 We will advise you through the Contact Us tool, as appropriate, of what method of delivery to use to return the Equipment. Depending on the nature of the Equipment purchased, we will either arrange a courier collection, or you must return the Equipment directly to us. If the Equipment is found on inspection to be defective, the cost of returning the item will be refunded to you. Authorised Equipment returns must be sent to the address we notify you of when you request the return.  
  
6.7.10 All returned Equipment must be accompanied by our Return Merchandise Authorisation number ('RMA Number') which can be obtained by using the Contact Us tool. Returned Equipment will not be accepted without an RMA Number. You must not write directly on the manufacturer's packaging. You must write the RMA number on the address label. Any defacement of the packaging or damage caused by inadequate packaging may result in the rejection of the return or an additional restocking fee, at our sole discretion.  
  
6.7.11 We cannot accept liability for packages damaged during transit. It is your responsibility to package the Equipment adequately to prevent damage.  
  
6.7.12 Proof of postage is not proof of delivery and you are therefore strongly advised to send your package by recorded delivery, registered post or courier, and to insure the Equipment for its full value.  
  
6.7.13 On receipt of the returned Equipment we may test it to identify the fault you have notified to us. If following the testing process the Equipment is found to be in good working order, without defect, we may return the Equipment to you and the carriage costs of this return will be your responsibility. If you have required us to provide you with replacement Equipment before completion of the testing process, you will also have to pay for this Equipment.  
  
6.7.14 This warranty will not apply if the Equipment has been worked upon, altered or damaged in any way by you or your employees or agents, or to Equipment not used in accordance with the producer's instructions.  
  
6.7.15 Unless otherwise stated in the producer's documentation, all Equipment delivered to a UK mainland address carries a 12-month warranty. If you wish to make a warranty claim, you must comply with the producer's instructions and warranty procedure. In order to resolve your problem as quickly as possible, we may refer you to the Equipment producer to deal directly with the return. In these instances, we will provide you with the contact information for the relevant producer. If you are a Consumer, this does not affect your statutory rights.  
  
6.7.16 No Software on which seals have been broken can be returned for credit. If any Software supplied by us is faulty, the producer will ordinarily replace it. If you are a Consumer this does not affect your statutory rights. Please note Software licences are non returnable unless the Software is materially non-compliant with its specification or the physical media on which it is supplied is defective.  
  
**6.8 Health and Safety:**  
  
6.8.1 In accordance with the Health and Safety at Work Act, 1974 and the Consumer Protection Act 1987, we confirm that the Equipment we supply as a distributor does not present a hazard to health and safety:  
  
6.8.1.1 when properly used for the purpose for which it is designed; and  
  
6.8.1.2 when you take reasonable and normal precautions in its use.  
  
**7\. Cancellation**

If the Services include line installation then, in relation to the line installation Service and related Services, this 7 day period is deemed to commence on the day after the day on which the Customer line is installed. In any 7 day period under this paragraph, you lose the right to cancel if the Service is used or otherwise performed within the 7 day period.  
  
7.1.3 If you have purchased Equipment, then you may cancel this Agreement in relation to the Equipment in accordance with the Regulations within 7 Working Days beginning with the day after the day on which you receive the Equipment.

If you have purchased audio or video recordings or computer software, then in any 7 day period under this clause you lose the right to cancel in relation to these when they are unsealed by you. Where they are supplied to you on-line, audio or video recordings or computer software shall be deemed to be unsealed when downloaded. You have no right to cancel in relation to the following contracts: for any gaming, betting or lottery services; for the supply of newspapers periodicals or magazines; for the supply of any goods made to your specifications or clearly personalised or which by their nature cannot be returned or are liable to deteriorate rapidly; for the supply of goods or services the price of which is dependant on fluctuations in the financial market which cannot be controlled by Metronet.  
  
7.1.5 If the Regulations apply, you may cancel Services or Equipment purchased from us by sending written notice of cancellation by post or hand delivery addressed to Customer Services at the address available under the Contact Us tool or by using the Contact Us tool.  
  
7.1.6 You will be responsible for the cost of returning the Equipment if you exercise this right of cancellation under the Regulations.

7.1.7 You are under a duty to retain possession of the Equipment whilst awaiting return to us and take reasonable care of it during this period. You will be liable for any loss of or damage to the Equipment if you fail to comply with this obligation.  
  
7.2 The Regulations, and this clause, do not apply to Business Customers.  
  
**8\. Providing Instructions**  
  
We may accept instructions regarding the Service and/or Equipment from any person who reasonably appears to be acting on your authority. Any agreements made on your behalf by such a person will be binding on you and subject to these Conditions.  
  
**9\. Service Security**  
  
9.1 We will issue you with a set of User Names and Passwords. These are essential for secure use of the Service and so you must ensure that you keep these confidential, secure and that you use them in accordance with all relevant instructions. Passwords and User Names must not be disclosed to anyone without authorisation. You must not send your passwords over the internet by email, chat or other insecure communication methods.  
  
9.2 You must not use a false identity in email or other network communications.  
  
9.3 You must not attempt or participate in, the unauthorised entry into or viewing of another Customer's account or another system.  
  
9.4 Computers and network systems shall not be used for fraudulent activities, or used to breach another organisation's security (cross networking hacking). This is an illegal act and prosecution under criminal law may result.  
  
9.5 Network traffic may be monitored from time to time for the purposes of backup, problem solving, network management and where required by law.  
  
9.6 If we think there has been or may be a breach of security or misuse of the Service, we may:

Any such changes will be notified to you by email or by the Contact Us tool.  
  
9.8 If you forget your User Name or Password or you think someone knows your User Name or Password and they are not authorised to use it, or if any Password is being or is likely to be used in an unauthorised way, it is your responsibility to inform Metronet immediately using the "Contact us" tool.  
  
9.9 If you are using Narrowband Products, you must make Caller Line Identification (CLI) available when using the Service to connect to the Internet. This is so that we can improve the safety and security of the Service. If you have disabled CLI, we may temporarily enable it to allow this connection.  
  
9.10 If any of the information provided by you during the sign-up procedure changes, including any changes to your payment details, you must inform us immediately. Please note that if you update your address because you are moving Premises and need Broadband at the new location (usually on a different phone line), there will be costs incurred for which you are liable.

Until we have received this payment, or you have completed the minimum contract period, whichever occurs earlier, we may prohibit the release of the Domain Name associated with this domain.  
  
13.7 Unless you notify us to the contrary, Services provided for an agreed period will automatically continue when the agreed period comes to an end.
