Terms of Use
============

1. Thank you for your interest in Educreations. Educreations is an online learning platform that enables educators to quickly and easily create whiteboard-style video tutorials that students can watch anytime, from anywhere. Please continue reading the following Terms of Use ("Terms") to learn about the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our services, including our various websites, products, and applications (collectively, the "Service").
    
2. Agreeing to these Terms
    -----------------------
    
    By creating an account on Educreations, or otherwise using or accessing our Service, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be subject to the terms in this document, as well as our [Privacy Policy](https://www.educreations.com/privacy/) and any other posted guidelines, policies, or rules applicable to specific features of the Service, which may be posted from time to time (collectively the "Guidelines"). These Terms of Use, including any other Guidelines (collectively, the "Agreement"), govern your use of the Service and are a legal contract between you and Educreations, Inc. ("Educreations," "Company," "we," or "us"). If there is any inconsistency between these Terms and any of the Guidelines, the additional Guidelines will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. If you are using the Service on behalf of an institution that has a separate written agreement with Educreations, and there is any inconsistency between that agreement and these Terms, that agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
    
3. Using the Service
    -----------------
    
    ### Permission to use Educreations
    
    As long as you are complying with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Educreations gives you permission to access and use the Service for your own personal, non-commercial use and educational purposes (meaning you may not leverage the Service as a separate business). You may not copy or distribute any part of the Service in any medium without the Company's prior written authorization.
    
    ### Who may use the Service
    
    You may use the Service only if you agree to form a binding contract with Educreations.
    
    You represent and warrant to Educreations that:
    
    * you are at least 13 years old, or, if you are under the age of 13, your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to this Agreement, and you have their permission to use the Service;
    * all registration information you have submitted is accurate and truthful;
    * you will maintain the accuracy of this information;
    
    If you are accepting these Terms and using the Service on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so on the entity's behalf and have the authority to bind them to this Agreement, in which case, the words "you" and "your" as used in these Terms shall refer to such entity. **If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not accept this Agreement and you may not use the Service.**
    
    This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.
    
    ### Use by children
    
    For users under the age of 13, Educreations follows the consent rules outlined in the US Federal Trade Commission's ("FTC") Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and its implementing regulations outlined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule ("COPPA") that prohibit online service providers from knowingly collecting personal information from children under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent or notice as applicable.
    
    As detailed in the [FTC's COPPA FAQ Section N](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#N.%20COPPA%20AND%20SCHOOLS), COPPA grants school administrators and teachers with the ability to act as the parents' agent in granting consent to the collection of childrens' information on the parents' behalf, when the collection of students' personal information by an online service provider is limited to the educational context. Educreations collects limited Personal Information from students ("Children's Personal Information"), as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.educreations.com/privacy/), but only where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has agreed, as required by these Terms, to either 1) obtain parental consent for that child to use the Service and disclose that personal information to Educreations; or 2) act as the parent's agent in granting consent for that child to use the Service and disclose that personal information to Educreations. The Children's Personal Information we collect is used only in support of the learning environment, and for no other commercial purpose.
    
    For clarity, it is our responsibility to comply with COPPA, and we rely on schools to provide consent under COPPA by acting as the agent of the parent. If you are a teacher, school or district administrator, counselor or other school employee ("School Personnel"), you represent and warrant that you will either 1) obtain consent from the parent or guardian of your students under 13 who will be accessing the Service; or 2) agree to act as the parents' agent in granting consent for your students under 13 to access the Service. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you are authorized by your school or district to use the Service, and that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school or district.
    
    For a more detailed description of the type of information we collect from children and how we use that information to provide our Service, please read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.educreations.com/privacy/).
    
    ### Changes to the Service
    
    We are constantly changing and improving our Service, and we reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Service (or any portion thereof), temporarily or permanently, with or without notice. You agree that Company shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification or discontinuance of our Service. You acknowledge and accept that Company does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to our Service and operation of our Service may be interfered with or adversely affected by numerous factors or circumstances outside of our control.
    
    We believe that you (or your school as applicable) own your own data and it's important to us to preserve your access to your data. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will provide you with an opportunity to export your data out of that Service.
    
4. Your Information and Content
    ----------------------------
    
    ### Privacy
    
    Protecting your privacy is extremely important to us, and we're very careful in choosing what data we collect from you and in how we use it. Please read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.educreations.com/privacy/), which details what personal information Educreations collects from you and how we use that data to provider our Service.
    
    ### Content Ownership
    
    You retain the rights to any content that you post on or through our Service, and you control who can view your content and how it is shared through your privacy settings. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You can share your content with anyone, anywhere you want.
    
    However, in order to provide our Service to you, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "license") to use your content.
    
    ### License
    
    In the course of using our Service, you may create, upload, or post content, including videos, photos, audio, drawings, graphics, text, data, and other information (collectively, the "User Submissions"). When you post User Submissions to our Service, you grant Educreations and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors a non-exclusive, transferable (only to a successor), sub-licensable, royalty-free, fully-paid, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, reproduce, modify, publish, transmit, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform and display your User Submissions (consistent with your privacy settings), including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of our Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. Because your User Submissions may be viewed or accessed by other Educreations users (subject to your privacy settings), you also hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Service, and to view, reproduce, modify, distribute, display and perform such User Submissions solely for personal, non-commercial use, as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms.
    
    You represent and warrant, and can demonstrate to Company’s full satisfaction upon request that you (i) own or otherwise control all rights to all content in your User Submissions, or that the content in your User Submissions is in the public domain, (ii) you have full authority to act on behalf of any and all owners of any right, title or interest in and to any content in your User Submissions to use such content as contemplated by these Terms and to grant the license rights set forth above, (iii) you have the permission to use the name and likeness of each identifiable individual person and to use such individual’s identifying or personal information as contemplated by these Terms; and (iv) you are authorized to grant all of the aforementioned rights to the User Submissions to the Company and all users of the Service.
    
    You represent and warrant that the use or other exploitation of such User Submissions by Company and use or other exploitation by users of the Site and Service as contemplated by this Agreement will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including without limitation any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.
    
    The above licenses granted by you in User Submissions you post to the Service terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you delete your User Submission from the Service, unless your User Submission has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. When you remove or delete User Submissions from the Service, you understand and agree, however, that Educreations may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your User Submissions that have been removed or deleted.
    
    When you publish User Submissions using the public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Educreations, to access and use that content, and to associate it with you (i.e. your name and profile picture).
    
5. Responsibility for Content and Conduct
    --------------------------------------
    
    It is our goal for Educreations to be a safe, helpful educational community for everyone. In order to make this happen, we need your help, which includes the following commitments:

    1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;
    2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
    3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;

    C. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Educreations' failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
