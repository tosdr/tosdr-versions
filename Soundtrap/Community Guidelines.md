Community Guidelines

These Community Guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone understands what the Soundtrap community is all about. Don't forget that your use of Soundtrap is also subject to our [Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.soundtrap.com/legal/terms/default&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730932753790385&usg=AOvVaw2LpQQYbpRoJDVcynXVtjVl) including the User Guidelines contained therein.

We expect you to follow these Community Guidelines and behave accordingly. Users who fail to abide by these Community Guidelines will, depending on severity, be warned or blocked from using the application and from communicating with their users.

Do:

Respect others

Soundtrappers are a diverse group with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great, but it means that everybody needs to be tolerant and respect people whose ideas are different from their own. Of course, if you feel that someone is expressing views or opinions that are offensive, defamatory, abusive, or otherwise contrary to our [Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.soundtrap.com/legal/terms/default&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730932753791337&usg=AOvVaw1gBFV3U8YTGvpuT1JKjlcB), you can let us know by [sending an email](mailto:support@soundtrap.com).

Create, upload and share

Soundtrap enables you to express yourself through your sounds, and lets you share those sounds across the web. So, be creative, be expressive and let the world know how awesome you are. But remember – only share sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. If you are unsure whether you can upload something, check out our [Copyright Information Pages](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.soundtrap.com/copyright/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730932753792007&usg=AOvVaw27HAS4KBsSNeHopILkyizf).

Criticize, but do it constructively

Criticism can be really valuable, but only when it’s done constructively. So, please share your opinions, but before posting anything, ask yourself, "Would I appreciate receiving the same comment?".

Don't:

Upload things that aren't yours to upload

Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100 percent certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading, or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other people’s content risks having their account suspended or terminated. If you need more information about copyright, check out our [Copyright Information pages](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.soundtrap.com/copyright/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730932753793009&usg=AOvVaw3MH3EaCYcyf0fezhPuwfIU).

Use someone else’s name

Soundtrap usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please don’t register accounts in the name of another person, or using someone else’s trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that someone is impersonating you on Soundtrap, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by [sending an email.](mailto:support@soundtrap.com)

Share sensitive information

We care about your safety and encourage you to be careful about the information that you post. Please do not post information such as name, address, personal identification number, social security number, email address, credit card information, or other personal information of you or other persons.

Rant, flame, troll

Soundtrap is a social place but let’s keep the conversations relevant and safe for all Soundtrap users.

Inappropriate behaviour, including abusive, defamatory, obscene, racist, sexist, harassing, threatening or offensive comments, will lead to the content being removed and put a user at risk of having their account suspended or terminated.

Spam

There’s a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your messages and actions personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Using sounds or comments to promote other products or services can be considered as spam and isn’t welcome on Soundtrap. For obvious reasons, do not post links to malware, trojan viruses, or otherwise malicious content.

If you break these rules

We take these rules seriously, and expect you to do so as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, we will remove said content. If we believe that your behaviour is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these warnings, we will suspend your account. In the most extreme cases, we may suspend your account without warning.

Tell us about it

If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it [here](mailto:takedown@soundtrap.com).

If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or our [Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.soundtrap.com/legal/terms/default&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730932753796232&usg=AOvVaw11myqQ5zL-VJB-CyehC8zI) – including offensive or defamatory comments, trade mark infringement, impersonation, stalking, harassment, breach of privacy or spamming - you can report this to us by [sending an email.](mailto:support@soundtrap.com)

Remember, we want Soundtrap to be a community where everyone feels comfortable and respected - it’s up to all of us to make sure this happens.

To sum it up

Be nice, respect the law and think before you post. We will remove any content that violates these Guidelines and/or our [Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.soundtrap.com/legal/terms/default&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730932753797213&usg=AOvVaw1q_aJEvT8lkfxGboDIFmGP). These Guidelines have been written to ensure that everyone within the community has a good experience on our site. Soundtrap should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please [let us know](mailto:support@soundtrap.com).

We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often for any updates.
