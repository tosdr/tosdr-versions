1. ### Introduction and binding agreement
    

Welcome to Soundtrap® for Education, a service provided by Soundtrap AB (“Soundtrap®”, “we” “our”, or “us”).

These Soundtrap® for Education Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”) govern your use of the Soundtrap® for Education services including all associated features and functionalities, websites, mobile and desktop applications and all related tools, applications, data, software, APIs as well as all other content and services associated with the Soundtrap® for Education services (the “Service”).

By signing up or otherwise accessing or using any part of the Service you are entering into a binding agreement with Soundtrap AB. If you are signing up or using the Service on behalf of a school, school district, or other educational organization or entity (the “School”) you are agreeing to the agreement on behalf of the School and promise that you have the authority to bind the School to this agreement. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to the School.

Your agreement with us includes these Terms of Use together with our [Data Processor Agreement](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.soundtrap.com/legal/dpa&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1733999420928467&usg=AOvVaw2Cam8eMpVPi-KmHbKpw6kr) and any additional terms to which you agree with us from time to time, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreement”). If you wish to read the terms of the Agreement, the current effective version can be found on our website, [www.soundtrap.com/edu](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.soundtrap.com/edu&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1733999420928592&usg=AOvVaw3H8lSvQoCENm9vhm8MTRAr) (the “Website”).

Please read these Terms of Use and the other referenced documents carefully, as they include important information on:

* your legal rights and obligations when you use the Service;
* your responsibilities for your end users’ use of the Service;
* the rights you give us when you and your end users use the Service;
* the rules everyone needs to follow when using the Service;
* other key information regarding changes and termination of the Service, automatic renewals, your liability for content, infringements and limitation of liability

You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreement, and agree to be bound by it. If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreement, then you and your end users may not use the Service or any parts thereof.

2. ### Registration and notice requirements
    

You are responsible for providing all notices to, and obtaining any and all consents from, any student invited to use the Service through your plan (“Student”) that may be required by applicable law. You will also convey notification on our behalf to your Students or, with respect to a Student under 18 years of age, to the Student’s parent or guardian, upon our request including in connection with any judicial order or lawfully-issued subpoena requiring the disclosure of Student personal data in our possession as may be required under applicable law.

3. ### Changes to the Agreement
    

We reserve the right to change, alter, replace or otherwise modify the Agreement, including these Terms of Use, at any time.

When we make any material changes to the Agreement, including these Terms of Use, we will provide you with notice as we deem appropriate under the circumstances, for example by updating the date of last modification and posting to the Website, displaying a prominent notice on the Website, within the Service and/or by sending an email to the email address registered in your account (we never send these emails to Students). In some cases we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have taken effect will constitute your acceptance of the revised Agreement. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreement, you may terminate the Agreement as described in the [Term and Termination section](#h.d6bxkmgq2mvo) below.

4. ### Our Service, subscriptions, price changes etc.
    

Soundtrap® for Education is a cloud-based hosting and collaborative audio recording platform for use by Students and teachers in an educational setting.

By purchasing a Soundtrap® for Education subscription, you will be granted access to our educational plan (the “Educational Subscription”) pursuant to which you may provide access for you and your Students and other end users to use the Service in accordance with the number of seats you have purchased. You acknowledge and agree that you: (a) are responsible for the use of the Service by your Students and all other end users that use the Service through your Educational Subscription, including any administrators or teachers (collectively, “End Users”); and (b) shall ensure that each of your End Users complies with the Agreement. You shall be responsible for all losses, damages, and costs (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by us in connection with any use of the Service by any End User, any claim made by an End User, or any failure of any End User to comply with the Agreement.

You may purchase an Educational Subscription either directly from us or from a third-party reseller (where available) (the “Reseller”). If the Educational Subscription is purchased from a Reseller, you will enter into a separate order form or agreement setting forth the fees to be paid by you to the Reseller for the Educational Subscription. We are not liable or responsible for any commercial or other terms agreed between you and the Reseller, except that we shall remain responsible for the provision of the Service in accordance with this Agreement, and your use of the Service shall be governed by the same.

You may purchase an Educational Subscription directly from us by paying the subscription fee in advance on a yearly basis, or some other recurring interval agreed upon prior to the purchase. Prices and fees are exclusive of VAT, GST, HST, sales taxes or other similar taxes, duties, charges or assessments ("Indirect taxes"). Indirect taxes will be added on top of agreed amounts as per local legislation. Each party shall be solely responsible for payment of all Indirect taxes it is legally obliged to pay arising as a result of this Agreement or otherwise. Taxes we collect, if any, will be listed separately on the invoice. You agree to make all payments of fees to us free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes.

If you use a credit card as payment method, your Educational Subscription and payment will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Educational Subscription upon thirty (30) days’ written notice before the end of the then-current subscription period. If you use another payment method, your payment will not renew automatically and your Educational Subscription will cancel automatically at the end of your initial subscription period. In both cases. the cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will have no continued right to use the Service thereafter. If you cancel the Educational Subscription before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.

We may change the price for the Educational Subscription from time to time and we will communicate any price changes in advance of any renewal and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you may reject the change by cancelling your Educational Subscription before the price change takes effect.

Any invoices are due and payable within thirty (30) days from the invoice date.

From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials or special offers of the Educational Subscription for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). These Trials may be subject to separate and additional terms and conditions. We may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law. Unless otherwise set forth in the Trial terms and conditions, you will have no continued right to use the Educational Subscription after the Trial expires.

19.2 CLASS ACTION WAIVER

WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

  
19.3 Arbitration

If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 19.3 is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:

19.3.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration

You and we agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and us arising in connection with or relating in any way to the Agreement or to your relationship with us as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreement) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreement.

19.3.2 Exceptions

Notwithstanding clause 19.3.1 above, you and we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

19.3.3 Arbitration rules

Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and us will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”) then in force (the “ICC Rules”) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.  
  
Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the relevant state or country listed in clause 23.1, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.

19.3.4 Time for filing

Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.

19.3.5 Notice; process

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Our address for Notice is: Soundtrap AB, Katarinavägen 15, 116 45, STOCKHOLM, Sweden. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, we shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (3) €1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.

Except as required to enforce the arbitrator’s decision and award, neither you nor we shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.  
  
19.3.6 Modifications  
  
In the event that we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to our address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our address for Notice, in which case your Soundtrap® account shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.19.3.7 Enforceability  
  
If the class action waiver in section 19.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this section 19.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this section 19.3 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreement.

20. ### Entire agreement, third party beneficiaries
    

Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and us, this Agreement together with and any additional terms you agree to from time to time, constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your and your End Users use of the Service and supersede any prior agreement between you and us with respect to the same subject matter. Any modifications to the Agreement other than by us as permitted by [Changes to the Agreement section](#h.snz2oek3w1yd) are prohibited without a written agreement signed by a representative with actual authority to bind us to those modifications.  

As noted previously, however, certain aspects of your use of the Service may be governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, when access to the Service is sold via a Reseller together with other services, or when you have agreed to terms and conditions of Third Party Services. To the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any such additional terms and these Terms of Use, the additional terms shall prevail.

21. ### Export control
    

Our products may be subject to U.S. export and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) maintained by the Department of State. You warrant that you and your End Users are (1) not located in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions; and (2) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions.

You and your End Users agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the EAR, trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC, and the ITAR. Specifically, you agree that you and your End Users shall not – directly or indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from us under the Agreement to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.
