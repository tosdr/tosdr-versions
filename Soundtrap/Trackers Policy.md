Soundtrap Cookie Policy
=======================

Effective as of 1 July, 2023

Hello, and welcome to Soundtrap’s Cookie Policy (“Policy”).

The objective of this Policy is to provide you, as a user of Soundtrap’s services and/or websites (collectively, the “Services”), with clear information about the cookies that Soundtrap uses, the role they play in helping us provide Soundtrap to you, and the choices you have when it comes to managing your cookie settings.

1\. What are cookies?
---------------------

Cookies are files which are downloaded to your device, for example, when you visit a website. They are useful because they allow us and our partners to recognise a user's device and support the continuity of your experience. You can find more information about cookies at: [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.allaboutcookies.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730932752878292&usg=AOvVaw1frA-soNeHAyqCuNupP6u8) or [www.youronlinechoices.eu](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730932752878597&usg=AOvVaw0cMQYi0nJUl9KuZ5nJUpbl).

2\. How do we use cookies?
--------------------------

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

There are a few different categories of cookies used by Soundtrap, as explained in the following table. You can find out more about how to control functional, performance and targeting cookies in Section 3 “Options for managing cookies”.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Cookie Type | Purposes |
| Functional cookies | These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features and content. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other parts of web pages that you can customise. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly. |
| Performance cookies | These cookies gather data about how visitors use our Services to enhance the performance of our Services. For example, these cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Services. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors interact with our Services. If you do not allow these cookies we will not be able to monitor the performance of our Services. |
| Targeting cookies | These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organisations such as advertisers. These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests. |
| Strictly necessary cookies | These cookies are set by Soundtrap or a third party on our behalf, and are essential to enable you to use the basic features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. Without these cookies, services you have asked for e.g. payment, cannot be provided. |

3\. Options for managing cookies
--------------------------------

There are several options available for managing your cookie preferences, depending on the cookie type and your device. Each of the options are described below. Please note that no one option is sufficient to manage all cookies on all devices. Therefore, you may wish to combine one or more options for complete coverage.

Browser Settings

You can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and delete cookies. You can withdraw or modify your consent to our use of cookies at any time, with the exception of strictly necessary cookies (as described above). To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" settings).

Consent Management Platform

Soundtrap uses a consent management platform ("CMP") to help you manage cookie preferences. You may view the CMP and access your cookie settings by clicking “Cookie Settings” in the footer of the website. The CMP allows you to consent to the setting of certain cookies. Using the CMP, you can manage your preferences in relation to how cookies are set according to the category of the cookie, as described in Section 2 “How do we use cookies?”. The CMP also allows us to maintain records of your consent. If you wish to update your consent choices via the CMP, please visit the “Cookie Settings” in the footer of the website.

Please note that as with your web browser settings you will not be able to withdraw consent for cookies which are strictly necessary for the Service to operate.

4\. Soundtrap for Education
---------------------------

If you are a student using the Soundtrap for Education Service, we are only using strictly necessary cookies that are essential to enable you to use the basic features of our Services.

5\. Updates to this policy
--------------------------

We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.

When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Soundtrap Service or by sending you an email if you are a user of the Soundtrap Service. We may notify you in advance.
