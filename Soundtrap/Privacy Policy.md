Provider offers the same privacy protections found in this DPA between it and \[Insert Name of Originating LEA\] (“Originating LEA”) which is dated \[Insert Date\], to any other LEA (“Subscribing LEA”) who accepts this General Offer of Privacy Terms (“General Offer”) through its signature below.

The Provider may withdraw the General Offer in the event of: (1) a material change in the applicable privacy statues; (2) a material change in the services and products listed in the originating Service Agreement; or three (3) years after the date of Provider’s signature to this Form.

EXHIBIT “G” – Supplemental SDPC State Terms
===========================================

NONE.

EXHIBIT “H” – Additional Terms or Modifications
===============================================

LEA and Provider agree to the following additional terms and modifications:    

Standard Clauses Article II Section 3 is hereby amended as follows:

3\. Separate Account. If Student-Generated Content is stored or maintained by the Provider, Provider shall, at the request of the LEA, transfer, or provide a mechanism for the LEA to transfer, said Student- Generated Content to a separate account created by the student. For clarity, the student must be at the age of consent for data processing in their jurisdiction in order to request a transfer to a non-school account. All students under the age of consent for data processing in their jurisdiction may only request transfer of their Student-Generated Content to another school account.

Standard Clauses Article IV Section 6 is hereby amended as follows:

6\. Disposition of Data. Upon written request from the LEA, Provider shall dispose of or provide a mechanism for the LEA to transfer Student Data obtained under the Service Agreement, within sixty (60) days of the date of said request and according to a schedule and procedure as the Parties may reasonably agree. Upon termination of this DPA, if no written request from the LEA is received, Provider shall dispose of all Student Data after a reasonable amount of time providing the LEA with reasonable prior notice. The duty to dispose of Student Data shall not extend to Student Data that had been De-Identified or placed in a separate student account pursuant to section II 3. The LEA may employ a “Directive for Disposition of Data” form, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit “D”. If the LEA and Provider employ Exhibit “D,” no further written request or notice is required on the part of either party prior to the disposition of Student Data described in Exhibit “D. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Provider shall not be required to dispose or return any computer records or files containing Student Data that have been created pursuant to its standard archiving or backup procedures, or contained in any archived electronic communications (e.g. emails). Provider may also retain a copy of Student Data if required by applicable law, rule or regulation. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Agreement shall apply to the archived and legally required copies so long as they exist.

Standard Clauses Article V Section 2 is hereby amended as follows:

2\. Audits. To the extent required by applicable law. No more than once a year, or following unauthorized access, upon receipt of a written request from the LEA with at least twenty (20) business days’ notice and upon the execution of an appropriate confidentiality agreement, the Provider will allow the LEA to audit the security and privacy measures that are in place to ensure protection of Student Data or any portion thereof as it pertains to the delivery of services to the LEA. Additionally, the Provider will cooperate reasonably with the LEA and any local, state, or federal agency with oversight authority or jurisdiction in connection with any audit or investigation of the Provider and/or delivery of Services to students and/or LEA, and shall provide reasonable access to the Provider’s facilities, staff, agents and LEA’s Student Data and all records pertaining to the Provider, LEA and delivery of Services to the LEA. Failure to reasonably cooperate shall be deemed a material breach of the DPA.

Standard Clauses Article V Section 3 is hereby amended as follows:

3\. Data Security. The Provider agrees to utilize administrative, physical, and technical safeguards designed to protect Student Data from unauthorized access, disclosure, acquisition, destruction, use, or modification while in its possession. The Provider shall adhere to any applicable law relating to data security. The provider shall implement an adequate Cybersecurity Framework based on one of the nationally recognized standards set forth in Exhibit “F”. Exclusions, variations, or exemptions to the identified Cybersecurity Framework must be detailed in an attachment to Exhibit “H”. Additionally, Provider may choose to further detail its security programs and measures that augment or are in addition to the Cybersecurity Framework in Exhibit “F”. Provider shall provide, in the Standard Schedule to the DPA, contact information of an employee who LEA may contact if there are any data security concerns or questions.
