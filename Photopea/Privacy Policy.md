Terms Of Use
============

The Photopea editor can be used by anyone for any purpose, for free. If Photopea allows you to do something, without asking you to pay, you can do it, and you don't have to pay. All your work belongs to you. You can sell the work, which you made in Photopea, without giving us any share. You don't have to mention that your work was made using Photopea.

We don't accept donations, but you can buy a Premium account (a one-time payment). E.g. paying for a 90-day Premium will give you a Premium account for 90 days. After that, it will switch you back to a free account. We never send any emails (you can check the state of your account only at Photopea.com).

Privacy Policy
==============

Files, which you open in Photopea, are never sent anywhere, they never leave your device. They are processed completely inside your device, by your own hardware. Because of this, if you close Photopea without saving your work, your work will be lost.
