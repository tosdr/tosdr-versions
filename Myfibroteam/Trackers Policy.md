### Use of cookies and other Tracking Technologies

MyHealthTeams, Inc. and our social networks ("MyHealthTeam," "MHT", "the Platform", "Services", "community", "social network", "we," "us," "our") and certain third parties, use cookies and other technologies ("Tracking Technologies") to collect personal data and to store information or gain access to information stored on your device, when you use our website, our app, and our services (together, the "Platform"). This policy tells you more about Tracking Technologies and how we use them in our Services.

If you do not consent to the use of these Tracking Technologies, please disable them by following the 'opt-out' links provided below or by changing your browser settings so that cookies from the Platform cannot be placed on your computer or mobile device (see [Controlling and Disabling Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies](#control-disable)).

We may change this policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to the way we handle your personal data in relation to Tracking Technologies, we will let you know by posting an updated version of this policy on our website.

### What are Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?

In order to personalize your experience on the social network, we use Tracking Technologies, including cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and similar files or technologies to collect and store information about your computer, device, and your interactions with the Platform.

For instance, we use cookies when you are logged in to the Platform to make sure that access to restricted features of the Platform are only available to registered members. We also use cookies when you visit the Platform as a non-member, as well, to understand and improve the platform performance for everyone.

A cookie is a small text file which includes a unique identifier that is sent by a web server to the browser on your computer, mobile phone or any other internet enabled device when you visit an on-line website. Cookies and similar technologies are widely used to make websites work efficiently and to collect information about your online preferences.

Some of our website pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, tags or pixels) that allow us to count users who have visited our pages. Web beacons collect only limited information, e.g. a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. We may also carry web beacons placed by third party advertisers. These beacons do not carry any information that could directly identify you.

We also include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to track whether you open the messages. We use this information to customize our services and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content, advertising campaigns, and products and services we offer through the Platform.

### How do we use Cookies and other Tracking Technologies?

We use cookies and other tracking technologies to customize content and advertising, provide social media features and to see how our visitors move through our website. We use this information to make decisions about ways to improve the services we offer you.
