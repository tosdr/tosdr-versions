_LAST REVISED: May 23, 2024_

This Cookie Policy describes the different categories of cookies and similar technologies that may be applied on the [websites ("**Sites**") of Daybreak Game Company LLC](https://www.daybreakgames.com/websites) ("**Daybreak**"). We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Please take a look at the "_LAST REVISED_" legend at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through the Sites.

1\. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND WHAT DO THEY DO?
-----------------------------------------

We collect information through cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies (collectively “Cookies”) to deliver and improve the Daybreak services, and to display relevant content, products, services, and advertising.

Cookies are a standard feature of websites that allow us to store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to our Sites. Cookies may be used to enable the functionality and services provided by our Sites and may be used for analytics and advertising purposes as described below. A tracking pixel is a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel or Javascript tag) that is placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows us to collect information regarding the use of the web page that contains the tracking pixel. You may choose whether to accept Cookies by changing the settings on your browser or choosing the opt out provided below. However, if you disable Cookies on our Sites, your experience on the Sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

2\. WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?
---------------------------

Below we list the different categories of Cookies that may be used on the Site. To the extent any Personal Information is collected through Cookies, [the Privacy Policy](https://www.daybreakgames.com/privacy) applies and complements this Cookie Policy.

**Essential Cookies.** Essential cookies enable you to navigate the Site and to use its services and features. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, the Site will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to and we may not be able to provide the Site or certain services or features.

**Preference Cookies.** Preference cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember language or other local settings and customize the Site accordingly.

**Social Media Cookies.** Social media cookies collect information about social media usage. These cookies may be stored and accessed by Daybreak and/or third party websites that provide social media services, such as [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/cookies/), [Twitter](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514-twitters-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies), or [YouTube](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/cookies/).

Daybreak may set these Cookies or they may be set by companies that help us with analytics, such as [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage). For example, analytics Cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the Site, help us record any difficulties you have with the Site, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Site, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyse the Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information.

**Advertising Cookies.** Advertising cookies are set to display targeted promotions or advertisements based upon your interests on the Site or to manage our advertising.
