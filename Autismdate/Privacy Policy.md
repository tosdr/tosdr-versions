Privacy Policy

IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE AND/OR THE APPLICATION.

1\. Autism Date users and visitors to our site

What information does Autism Date collect if I decide to join the Autism Date social community?

Complete our online registration form, where we ask you to provide us with information about you such as your name, your email address, your gender, your date of birth, your location details. You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your “Profile” page, which gives you the chance to correct or update (other than gender and email address) your information at any time by just logging in to Autism Date.

Once you have created a Profile, we will automatically track certain information such as your IP and email addresses.

What information does Autism Date collect about me if I’m under 18?

You can only become a member of Autism Date if your aged 18 or over or the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than 18. That means Autism Date does not knowingly collect any information about children, minors or anyone under the age of majority. Nor do we knowingly market to children, minors or anyone under the age of 18. If you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and delete their Profile information from Autism Date. If we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.

Does Autism Date collect my personal information if I am not a member and just visit the site?

If I put other information about me on the site, what does Autism Date do with it?
