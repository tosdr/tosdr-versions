**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW IS IT USED?**

**Information You Voluntarily Submit to The Sites.**

We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. 

Personal Data that is collected when you voluntarily provide it in connection with the Sites, Ad Management (by potential Publishers that are submitting an application), Grow Social, Grow, or Trellis may include, but is not limited to, the below:   

* Your name 
* Your email address
* Your website URL and name
* Company name
* Phone number
* Billing information
* Address
* Information about your website’s analytics and platform
* Date of Birth
* In the case of Mediavine Direct, information about your campaign

Our legal basis for processing this information is your consent, and by voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to us, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred and stored from your current location to the offices and servers of Mediavine located in the United States and the authorized third parties referenced below.

**Automatically Collected Information and Information We Collect from Others.**

We may receive information about you from other trusted sources, such as information that validates or supplements information automatically collected.  We may collect information from third-parties that assist us in serving targeted advertisements, as detailed below in the section about Ad Management.

**Sites**.  When you use the Sites, we may log your IP address, operating system type, browser type, referring website, pages you viewed, and the dates/times when you accessed the Sites. We may also collect usage data, which is information about actions you take when using the Sites, such as links clicked.   

**Grow and Video Player**.  Third-party website owners that utilize Grow (“Grow Publishers”) or the Video Player may collect your IP address or your email address.  If you consent to receiving content recommendations through Grow, we will collect your IP address.  If you sign up to receive email newsletters from Grow Publishers, we may also collect a hashed, pseudo anonymized form of your email address.  The hashed, pseudo anonymized email address may be used to create a match or link between this data and other anonymized data in third party databases or utilized by advertising partners.  This link may be shared by our partners globally for the purpose of enabling interest-based content or advertising throughout your online experience (e.g. cross device, web, email, in-app, etc.) by third parties unaffiliated with our website. 

If you choose to create an account with Grow using a magic link provided by Mediavine instead of creating a password, you must provide your email address.   Mediavine does not collect or store any other information in connection with your use of the magic link.   

If you provide your email address through Grow Automailer to sign up for a Grow Publisher’s mailing list, we will collect your email address.  

**Ad Management**.  We may collect or receive information about you from publishers that are members of the Mediavine Ad Management service (“Publishers”) through our use of cookies, pixels or server to server connections.   We (or our third-party partners – detailed in the section entitled “[Third Party Use of Personal Information](#third-party-use)”) may also combine and associate this information with information collected about other ads we have served.  

Mediavine collects and processes the following data from Publishers to provide interest-based, targeted advertising on Publisher websites.  

* Advertising Identifier 
* IP Address
* Operating System type
* Operating System version
* Device Type and Model
* Cookie information
* Language of the website
* Web browser type
* Email (in hashed form)

The information will be retained by Mediavine for the duration of the browser session and is only used by Mediavine to provide end users of the website with targeted advertising.  

You may choose whether to receive personalized or unpersonalized ads on Publisher sites.   Depending on your choice, will depend on the data collected on the Publisher website.  Please refer to each Publisher’s site privacy policy for further details. We do not control the data privacy or protection policies of third parties, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. 

**Cookies.** We may log information using cookies, which are small data files stored on your browser by the Sites, Ad Management, Create, Grow Social, Grow, Trellis or the Video Player (“Cookies”). We may use both session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay on your browser until deleted, to provide you with a more personalized experience on the Sites. Please see the “Cookie Policy” section below for more information about our use of cookies. Our legal basis for processing this information is your consent and our legitimate interests, namely monitoring and improving the Sites and Services.

**COOKIE POLICY**

We use, and allow certain other companies to use, Cookies on our Sites and in our Services to personalize content and ads, to provide social media features, to store saved content as a user of Grow Social or Grow, to analyze our traffic, and to recognize your device.  We also share information about your use of our Sites and our Services with our social media, advertising and analytics partners. This section explains what cookies are, how we use Cookies and similar technologies on our Sites and our Service and what you can do to manage how Cookies are used.

**What are cookies?**

A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Sites and Service.  The Cookie will collect information relating to your use of our Sites, information about your device such as the device’s IP address and browser type, demographic data and, if you arrived at our Sites and Service via a link from a third party site, the URL of the linking page. 

In addition to Cookies, our Sites may use web beacons.  Web beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited or accessed the Sites and to recognize users by accessing our cookies. We may employ web beacons to facilitate Site administration and navigation, to track the actions of users of the Sites, to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates, and to provide an enhanced online experience for visitors to the Sites. We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail messages that we send to determine which e-mail messages were opened. A web beacon is often invisible because it is only 1 x 1 pixel in size with no color.  A web beacon can also be known as a web bug, 1 by 1 GIF, invisible GIF and tracker GIF. 

**What are the different types of cookies and how do we use them?**

Essential – These are Cookies which are essential for the running of our Sites and Services. Without these Cookies, parts of our Sites and Service would not function.  These Cookies do not track where you have been on the internet and do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes.

Examples of how we may use essential Cookies include:

* Setting unique identifiers for each unique visitor, so that website numbers can be analyzed.

Functional – These Cookies are used to remember your preferences on our Sites and Services and to provide enhanced, more personal features. The information collected by these Cookies is usually anonymized, so we cannot identify you personally.  Functional Cookies do not track your internet usage or gather information which could be used for selling advertising.

Examples of how we may use functional Cookies include:

* Gathering data about visits to our Sites and Services, including numbers of visitors and visits, length of time spent on the site, pages clicked on or where visitors have come from
* Eliminating the need for returning users to re-enter their login details.

Analytical Performance – Analytical performance Cookies are used to monitor the performance of our Sites, for example, to determine the number of page views and the number of unique users our Sites and Services have. We use this information to improve user experience or identify areas of the Sites and Services which may require maintenance.  The information is anonymous (i.e. it cannot be used to identify you and does not contain personal information such as your name and email address) and it is only used for statistical purposes.

Examples of how we may use analytical Cookies include:

* Measuring users’ behavior 
* Analyze which pages are viewed and how long for and which links are followed to better develop our Sites and Services

Advertising – Behavioral advertising Cookies, which may be placed on your device by us or our trusted third-party service providers, remember that you have visited a website and use that information to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your interests. This is often called online behavioral advertising and is done by grouping together shared interests based upon web browsing history. Your web browsing history can be used to infer things about you (e.g. your age, gender etc.), and this information may also be used to make advertising on websites more relevant to you.  Although behavioral advertising Cookies can track your activity around the internet, these Cookies cannot identify you personally.  

Examples of how we may use advertising Cookies include:

* Manage online advertising.  The Services may use Cookies together with web beacons to provide advertising to you on the Publisher Sites and to enable us to manage our relationship with those advertisers by, for example, tracking how many unique users have seen a particular advertisement or followed a link in an advertisement.
* To market to specific users across our Sites, the Publisher Sites and third party sites, so that we and third parties can target advertising to users that will be more relevant to users’ interests.  

Third Party Cookies – You may notice on some pages of our Sites and Services that Cookies have been set that are not related to us. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook, these third party service providers may set their own Cookies on your device. We do not control the use of these third party Cookies and cannot access them due to the way that Cookies work, as Cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them. Please check the third party websites for more information about these Cookies.

**How can you manage or opt-out of cookies?**

Cookies, including those which have already been set, can be deleted from your hard drive. You can also change the preferences/settings in your web browser to control Cookies. In some cases, you can choose to accept Cookies from the primary site, but block them from third parties. In others, you can block Cookies from specific advertisers, or clear out all Cookies. Deleting or blocking Cookies may reduce functionality of the Sites and the Services. To learn more about how to reject Cookies, visit [**www.allaboutcookies.org**](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) or go to the help menu within your internet browser. If you experience any problems having deleted Cookies, you should contact the supplier of your web browser.

* To provide and maintain the Sites, Ad Management, Create, Grow Social, Grow, Trellis or the Video Player;

* To respond to your comments or inquiries; 
* To provide you with user support; 
* To protect, investigate, and deter against unauthorized or illegal activity.

**Ad Management**.  In connection with the Ad Management services, we use the information collected to provide personalized advertisements to users of Publisher sites.  We also monitor and provide information related to activities you may take in connection with the ads served through the Ad Management services, such as clicks or views.   We will use your information to detect fraud and maintain security and to improve our services.

We (and the Mediavine Partners, as detailed in our section about Third-Parties below) may also use the information collected to link to other end user information we or other Mediavine Partners have independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements.  We and other Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes cookie information, device information, usage data, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor’s referral source to a particular website.  Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.

**Grow**.  In connection with Grow, Mediavine may utilize your IP address, email address and hashed, anonymized email address to display personalized ad content on any third-party website that you view while you are signed in to the Grow service.  You may also receive email communications which may contain suggested personalized content that has been compiled based on content you may have viewed and/or favorited using Grow.   If you consent to receive the suggested personalized content recommendations, Mediavine will also collect your IP address.   

**Non-Identifiable Data**: When you interact with Mediavine through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Mediavine may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Mediavine affiliates, agents, or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, user behavior in connection with personalized ads.  It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.

**Aggregated Personal Data**: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Mediavine often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Mediavine may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Mediavine may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

From time to time, the Website may engage in remarketing efforts with third-party companies, such as Google, Facebook, or Instagram, in order to market the Sites. These companies use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Website. We use the following third-party service providers for remarketing:

Facebook: [**Opt-out of Facebook remarketing here**](http://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217)

Google: [**Opt-out of Google remarketing here**](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en)

Instagram: [**Opt-out of Instagram remarketing here**](https://help.instagram.com/2885653514995517/)

**Pseudonymized Data**.  Through certain of the Services, Mediavine may collect personal data that is subsequently pseudonymized.   Mediavine has placed certain internal restrictions and security measures in place to maintain such data as pseudonymized.  

**Newsletters**.  On the Website, you may subscribe to our newsletter, which may be used for advertising purposes. All newsletters sent may contain tracking pixels. The pixel is embedded in emails and allows an analysis of the success of online marketing campaigns. Because of these tracking pixels, we may see if and when you open an email and which links within the email you click. Also, this allows the Website to adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the user. This behavior will not be passed on to third parties.

**THIRD-PARTY USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Mediavine may share your Personal Data with certain third-parties as set forth below:

**Third Party Vendors**: We may share your information with third party vendors or service providers who help us provide the Services or the Sites, including database hosting and data processing services, and assist us in responding to requests by you for information that you request.   Please see our list of data processors above for more specifics.

**Legal Requirements**: Mediavine may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation or to respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity or in connection with our own investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, in which case we may (and you hereby authorize us to) disclose information without subpoenas or warrants served on us, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Mediavine, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Sites or the public, (iv) protect against legal liability including to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Customer contracts.

**RIGHTS RELATED TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Under laws in certain countries in which we operate, customers and other visitors to our Website from those countries have a right to access Personal Data about themselves, and to amend, correct or delete Personal Data that is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated.  We will, upon request, provide you with confirmation regarding whether we are processing Personal Data about you, consistent with applicable law. In addition, upon your request, we will take reasonable steps to correct, amend, or delete your Personal Data that is found to be inaccurate, incomplete or processed in a manner non-compliant with this Privacy Policy or applicable law, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, where the rights of persons other than you would be violated or where doing so is otherwise consistent with applicable law. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee to cover costs for providing copies of Personal Information that you request. 

Please note that while any amendments, corrections or deletions will be reflected in active user databases (as updated with a reasonable period of time), we may retain all Personal Data for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, and satisfaction of other legal obligations we reasonably believe applicable.

You authorize us to use and disclose any new or modified information that you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you agree that we are under no obligation to delete or modify information that you have previously chosen to provide us as to which you have not instructed us to take such action. Please remember, however, that if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Data to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Data any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.

We may retain your Personal Data to comply with laws, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our contracts, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.

Please contact us at **privacy@mediavine.com** to submit a request or obtain information regarding any of the above.

**EU RESIDENTS**

**LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING DATA UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (“GDPR”)**

Below are the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your Personal Data:

* Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us at webmaster@mediavine.com.
* Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
* Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your Personal Data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject.
* Consent means where you have consented to a certain use of your Personal Data.
* Vital Interest means processing your Personal Data to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.

**How to File a GDPR Complaint.**

We hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information. The General Data Protection Regulation also gives you the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in the European Union (or European Economic Area) state where you work, normally live, or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred.

**WHERE YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS HELD.**

Personal Data may be held at our offices and those of our affiliates, parent or related companies, third party agencies, service providers, representatives and agents as described below (see “Third Party Use of Personal Information”).

Some of these third parties may be based outside the European Economic Area. For more information, including on how we safeguard your personal information when this occurs, see below.

**TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL DATA OUT OF THE EEA**

We may transfer to, and store the data we collect about you in, countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected, including the United States, or other destinations outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the data. When we transfer your data to other countries, we will protect the data as described in this Privacy Policy and comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of data to countries outside the EEA and outside the United Kingdom.

If you are located in the EEA or the United Kingdom, we will only transfer your personal data if:

* the country to which the personal data will be transferred has been granted a European Commission adequacy decision; or
* we have put in place appropriate safeguards in respect of the transfer, for example we have entered into EU standard contractual clauses and required additional safeguards with the recipient, such as pseudonymization or the recipient is a party to binding corporate rules approved by an EU or UK supervisory authority; or
* the data has been anonymized and cannot identify you.
