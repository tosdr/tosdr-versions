Mediavine is an ad management service that helps content creators (publishers) build a sustainable business by monetizing their sites with ads.  
  
This Notice is specific to Mediavine and explains how and when Mediavine collects, uses, shares, or sells your personal information when you visit one of our publisher’s websites, provide your email on a website to join a newsletter or access features managed by Mediavine or create a Grow account as a reader using your name and email. If a publisher is managing their own subscriptions, or collecting personal data beyond the services of Mediavine and Grow, it must disclose any collection, use, sharing or sale of personal data in its own privacy notice and comply with relevant privacy laws.  
  
To exercise your privacy rights, please contact us at [privacy@mediavine.com](mailto:privacy@mediavine.com).

Mediavine is a registered vendor (ID 858) with the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework with respect to a registered CMP (ID 46) with the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework. Mediavine attests to its participation in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and compliance with the Policies and Specifications of the Transparency & Consent Framework.

* IP Address (unique address that identifies your device on the internet)
* Location (country, city, state)
* Operating System (e.g., Windows or Mac)

Advertising Management  
Mediavine provides advertising management services to publishers to assist them in the delivery of ads on their sites that align with your interests. We collect information about your online activities and browsing information, including websites you visit, pages you view, search terms, the apps you use, the language and device you use, and location. This information is then passed to our partners to enable them to display interest-based advertising to you on the publisher site you are visiting. To learn more, please visit [https://www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/); [ICO - What are cookies and similar technologies](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies/); [https://learnwebanalytics.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-cookie-a-pixel-and-a-tag/](https://learnwebanalytics.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-cookie-a-pixel-and-a-tag/).

Grow  
In some, but not all cases, Grow powers the subscription process for newsletters and access features on our publishers’ websites. When we do provide these services, we collect your email when you sign up and will use your email to send the newsletters and to provide access to the features. If requested by the publisher, we may also provide your email to them so they may send you newsletters or other information outside of Mediavine services.  
  
A Grow account allows you to save and bookmark content from multiple publisher sites, get access to exclusive content, and more. When you register for a Grow account, Mediavine will collect your name and email (and password for login).

For subscription, feature access or account creation in Grow, Mediavine will use your email in hashed form (email converted into a unique encrypted string of characters) to enable interest- based advertising.

Mediavine may use your data to send newsletters, communicate with you, improve our services and websites, allow you to log into your Grow account, secure our websites and platforms, and fulfill any purpose for which you provide your information. Your email may also be used by Mediavine to send marketing emails to you. If you no longer wish to receive marketing emails from Mediavine, you may unsubscribe at any time using the ”Unsubscribe” link in the email.  
  
**Does Mediavine collect personal data from children?  
**Our publishers’ sites are not created for children, therefore Mediavine does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think that your child’s personal data has been accidently collected, please contact us at [privacy@mediavine.com](mailto:privacy@mediavine.com).

**Does Mediavine share or sell my personal information for interest-based advertising?**  
Yes, Mediavine will use, share, license, sell or otherwise disclose your personal information to our partners, including advertisers, to enable interest-based advertising to be displayed on publisher sites. To learn more about Mediavine partners, visit [Mediavine Ad Partners.](https://www.mediavine.com/ad-partners/)

Mediavine shares data, such as location, site content, and unique identifiers (information used to distinguish you from others), through the bid stream and other integrations with our partners. Using this information, our partners bid for the opportunity to serve an interest-based ad to you in the ad space on the site.  
  
Mediavine may send your hashed email to identity partners to have a unique identifier created. When this unique identifier is shared with our partners and other platforms, it allows your data to be matched with other data about you. Using your hashed email address also allows for the creation of a profile of your interests, online activities, demographics, and interactions with ads. Mediavine may share the unique identifier and the profile data in the bid request and through other platforms allowing partners, including advertisers, to understand more about you, to assess the value of showing you a particular ad, and to show you ads that match your interests and needs, benefiting both you and our partners.

Mediavine may also use your hashed emails, profiles, and interactions with our publishers’ websites to include you in a group of users with similar characteristics such as age group, location or interests to create an audience. This audience data does not directly identify you. We may share or sell this audience data with our partners so the partner can show you ads that match your interests or to other platforms so the partner can improve their advertising by showing more relevant ads to their users.

**How can I opt out of interest-based advertising?**  
On the publisher site, you may take the following actions:

If you initially accept the use of cookies, but change your mind, you can access the banner by clicking “Update Privacy Settings” at the bottom of the page on the publisher’s site to change your preferences at any time.

**GROW AND READER ACCOUNTS**

**Grow.** Grow is an engagement tool (“Grow”) that can be used by either Website owners (“Site Owner(s)”) or Readers. This Agreement applies to the use of Grow by You as a Reader. If You are also a Site Owner and wish to use Grow in Your Site Owner capacity, then in addition to this Agreement, You must separately accept additional terms applicable to the use of Grow by a Site Owner. Grow provides for a universal log-in wherein a Reader may (1) bookmark or save content from one or more Websites (“Content”), and also to the ability to import content previously bookmarked or saved from other sources into Grow (“Saved Content”, encompassing both Content bookmarked or saved by a Reader through Grow or imported to Grow), consolidating all such materials in a single online location for ease of access; (2) favorite or “heart” Content with such interaction appearing on the Website; (3) connect the Reader’s social media accounts and enable sharing Content on Reader’s social media channels or with third parties via email; (4) subscribe to a Website’s mailing list; (5) search Content and Saved Content; (6) opt-in to receive recommended Content; (7) access exclusive Content; and (8) utilize other features or functions or enhancements that Mediavine may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make generally available (for clarity, the foregoing are collectively included in the Grow definition). Content shall include blog posts and all associated text, images, and video and any newsletters sent to You by the Website. As a Reader, You may have limited access to a Grow function generally referred to as the “Grow Publisher Portal.” Full access to the Grow Publisher Portal requires You to be a Site Owner and use Grow in Your Site Owner capacity. Any use of features You are able to access in the Grow Publisher Portal as a Reader is subject to this Agreement. While Mediavine may make additional features, functions, or enhancements to Grow and/or the Reader Account available now or in the future, You acknowledge and agree that Mediavine is under no obligation to do so.

**Reader Account.** When creating a Reader Account, You will be asked to provide Your email address. You may only create one Reader Account per email address. You will also need to either create a unique password for the Reader Account or utilize a magic link provided to the email address used to create the Reader Account. Should You utilize the magic link to create the Reader Account, You may subsequently either create a password under the Account - Tools tab in the Reader Account for future logins to the Reader Account or continue logging in through a magic link that is generated upon Your request. You may also create a Reader Account using Your Facebook or Google login information. In the event You utilize the Facebook or Google login option, You understand that You are also subject to Facebook’s and/or Google’s terms and conditions and privacy policies as well as this Agreement. Once You sign up for a Reader Account, You have the option to provide additional information. The Privacy Policy details how Mediavine handles any such information You choose to provide it.

**Access.** You may only use and access Your own Reader Account, and You may not provide another person with the username and password or any magic link to access Your Reader Account. You are responsible for keeping all login credentials to access the Reader Account confidential. Usernames and passwords are the property of Mediavine. You are solely and fully responsible and liable for any and all activities that occur through, or any use of, Your Reader Account, regardless of whether such use or activities are undertaken by You or a third party and whether or not authorized. You agree to immediately notify Mediavine if You suspect or believe that Your Reader Account has been compromised in any way, including any unauthorized use of Your username, password, any magic link, or any other breach of security. Mediavine reserves the right to seek any remedy available to protect Confidential Information (as defined herein) and Grow from unauthorized third-party access. Mediavine is not responsible for any unauthorized access to or alteration, damage, or failure to store any Saved Content or other data You submit or use in connection with a Reader Account or Grow.

**API AND LINKS**

**API.** Your use of Grow, including importing Saved Content, subscribing to Website mailing lists, and opting in to receive personalized Content recommendations, as well as the provision of personalized content suggestions and advertisements by Mediavine, may involve the use of one or more APIs by Mediavine or Site Owners. By using Grow, you hereby acknowledge the use of APIs and consent to the sharing of any data pertaining to You and Your use of Grow with the software or platform the APIs connect to and the operator or authorized user of the software or platform.

**Links.** As a convenience, Grow and Websites may contain links to third-party websites, goods, or services that are not owned or controlled by Mediavine (“Third-Party Links”). Mediavine has no control over and assumes no responsibility for the content, data management, privacy policies, or practices of any Third-Party Links. Mediavine does not warrant the offerings of any Third-Party Links. Your access and use Third-Party Links and transact or interact with the associated entities or individuals at Your sole risk and liability. You acknowledge and agree that Mediavine shall not be responsible or liable for any damage or loss in connection with Your use of or reliance on any Third-Party Links.

**TERM, TERMINATION, AND SUSPENSION**

**Term.** This Agreement shall be effective from the date of acceptance until it is terminated by either You or Mediavine in accordance with this Agreement (the “Term”).

**Termination by You.** You may terminate this Agreement at Your convenience at any time, for any or no reason, by logging into Your Reader Account and choosing “Delete Account” under the Account - Tools tab. If You have subscribed to a Site Owner’s mailing list through Grow, You must direct any requests in connection with that mailing list to the Website, including requests to unsubscribe which may be in the form of selecting “unsubscribe” or similar on a mailing from the Website.
