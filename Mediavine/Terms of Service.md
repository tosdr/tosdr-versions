Mediavine is an ad management service that helps content creators (publishers) build a sustainable business by monetizing their sites with ads.  
  
This Notice is specific to Mediavine and explains how and when Mediavine collects, uses, shares, or sells your personal information when you visit one of our publisher’s websites, provide your email on a website to join a newsletter or access features managed by Mediavine or create a Grow account as a reader using your name and email. If a publisher is managing their own subscriptions, or collecting personal data beyond the services of Mediavine and Grow, it must disclose any collection, use, sharing or sale of personal data in its own privacy notice and comply with relevant privacy laws.  
  
To exercise your privacy rights, please contact us at [privacy@mediavine.com](mailto:privacy@mediavine.com).

Mediavine is a registered vendor (ID 858) with the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework with respect to a registered CMP (ID 46) with the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework. Mediavine attests to its participation in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and compliance with the Policies and Specifications of the Transparency & Consent Framework.

* IP Address (unique address that identifies your device on the internet)
* Location (country, city, state)
* Operating System (e.g., Windows or Mac)
* Device Information (hardware, platform, location and carrier data)

Advertising Management  
Mediavine provides advertising management services to publishers to assist them in the delivery of ads on their sites that align with your interests. We collect information about your online activities and browsing information, including websites you visit, pages you view, search terms, the apps you use, the language and device you use, and location. This information is then passed to our partners to enable them to display interest-based advertising to you on the publisher site you are visiting. To learn more, please visit [https://www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/); [ICO - What are cookies and similar technologies](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies/); [https://learnwebanalytics.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-cookie-a-pixel-and-a-tag/](https://learnwebanalytics.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-cookie-a-pixel-and-a-tag/).

Grow  
In some, but not all cases, Grow powers the subscription process for newsletters and access features on our publishers’ websites. When we do provide these services, we collect your email when you sign up and will use your email to send the newsletters and to provide access to the features. If requested by the publisher, we may also provide your email to them so they may send you newsletters or other information outside of Mediavine services.  
  
A Grow account allows you to save and bookmark content from multiple publisher sites, get access to exclusive content, and more. When you register for a Grow account, Mediavine will collect your name and email (and password for login).

For subscription, feature access or account creation in Grow, Mediavine will use your email in hashed form (email converted into a unique encrypted string of characters) to enable interest- based advertising.

Mediavine may use your data to send newsletters, communicate with you, improve our services and websites, allow you to log into your Grow account, secure our websites and platforms, and fulfill any purpose for which you provide your information. Your email may also be used by Mediavine to send marketing emails to you. If you no longer wish to receive marketing emails from Mediavine, you may unsubscribe at any time using the ”Unsubscribe” link in the email.  
  
**Does Mediavine collect personal data from children?  
**Our publishers’ sites are not created for children, therefore Mediavine does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think that your child’s personal data has been accidently collected, please contact us at [privacy@mediavine.com](mailto:privacy@mediavine.com).

**Does Mediavine share or sell my personal information for interest-based advertising?**  
Yes, Mediavine will use, share, license, sell or otherwise disclose your personal information to our partners, including advertisers, to enable interest-based advertising to be displayed on publisher sites. To learn more about Mediavine partners, visit [Mediavine Ad Partners.](https://www.mediavine.com/ad-partners/)

Mediavine shares data, such as location, site content, and unique identifiers (information used to distinguish you from others), through the bid stream and other integrations with our partners. Using this information, our partners bid for the opportunity to serve an interest-based ad to you in the ad space on the site.  
  
Mediavine may send your hashed email to identity partners to have a unique identifier created. When this unique identifier is shared with our partners and other platforms, it allows your data to be matched with other data about you. Using your hashed email address also allows for the creation of a profile of your interests, online activities, demographics, and interactions with ads. Mediavine may share the unique identifier and the profile data in the bid request and through other platforms allowing partners, including advertisers, to understand more about you, to assess the value of showing you a particular ad, and to show you ads that match your interests and needs, benefiting both you and our partners.

Mediavine may also use your hashed emails, profiles, and interactions with our publishers’ websites to include you in a group of users with similar characteristics such as age group, location or interests to create an audience. This audience data does not directly identify you. We may share or sell this audience data with our partners so the partner can show you ads that match your interests or to other platforms so the partner can improve their advertising by showing more relevant ads to their users.

**How can I opt out of interest-based advertising?**  
On the publisher site, you may take the following actions:

**Mediavine’s DSA Transparency Report – Intermediary Services 2024**

Mediavine is an advertising management and monetization service.

Table of Contents

1. Introduction
2. Data Processing Overview
3. Transparency Reporting Obligations
4. Content Moderation Reporting
5. Summary and Reporting Period

**I. Introduction**

Mediavine is a full-service advertising management company that offers technology and services to help website owners monetize their websites through programmatic advertising.

**II. Data Processing Overview**

Mediavine presents to you our Digital Services Act Transparency Report, as mandated by the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA). This is the first of Mediavine’s annual Transparency Reports that will cover requirements as part of the DSA. This report sets out how Mediavine continues to maintain the goals of safeguarding the digital landscape.

**III. Transparency Reporting Obligations**

Mediavine strives to maintain a safe online environment for users and to provide guidelines to our publishers, consumers and users, as well as to reflect evolving regulatory requirements in the digital sphere impacted by our services.

**IV. Content Moderation Reporting**

Under the DSA, content moderation is defined to mean activities, whether automated or not, undertaken by providers of intermediary services, that are aimed, in particular, at detecting, identifying and addressing illegal content or information incompatible with their terms and conditions, provided by recipients of the service, including measures taken that affect the availability, visibility, and accessibility of that illegal content or that information, such as demotion, demonetization, disabling of access to, or removal thereof, or that affect the ability of the recipients of the service to provide that information, such as the termination or suspension of a recipient’s account.

Essentially, content moderation refers to the practices and processes employed by online platforms to manage user-generated content, content creations and properties on their services. Mediavine has developed a content moderation process to ensure a secure online environment for both publishers and users. Mediavine employs data engineers, data analysts, and software developers to protect users from inappropriate and illegal content. These employees collectively help us drive both automated and manual content moderation processes.

Mediavine undertakes a review of the content utilizing its services to identify potential violations of our own internal standards and statutory law. There are various types of potential violations flagged and as a result website pages may be demonetized until publishers cure the violation. These violations include, but are not limited to:

\*Hacking

\*Software Pirating

\*Pornographic content

\*Containing, promoting, or linking to any form of illegal activity

\*Material that promotes violence or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, physical ability, mental ability, or age

\*Material that contains unlawful, indecent, incendiary, abusive, harassing, or otherwise objectionable content as determined in Mediavine’s sole discretion

\*Material that defames, abuses, or threatens physical harm to others

\*Material targeting end users under the age of 18

\*Inappropriate newsgroup postings, chat or forum abuse, or unsolicited e-mail (SPAM)

\*Torrent sites

\*Sites illegally distributing copyright protected content

\*Material that infringes or appears to infringe the intellectual property rights of any person or contravenes or appears to contravene any applicable laws, regulations, or code of conduct

\*Unmoderated user generated content

Mediavine has a reporting and complaints procedure to review potentially unlawful content. Users, publishers, and copyright holders have various legal remedies available if they do not agree with Mediavine’s decision to remove ads or content.

5. Summary and Reporting Period

**I. Introduction**

Mediavine is a full-service advertising management company that offers technology and services to help website owners monetize their websites through programmatic advertising.

**II. Data Processing Overview**

Mediavine presents to you our Digital Services Act Transparency Report, as mandated by the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA). This is the first of Mediavine’s annual Transparency Reports that will cover requirements as part of the DSA. This report sets out how Mediavine continues to maintain the goals of safeguarding the digital landscape.

**III. Transparency Reporting Obligations**

Mediavine strives to maintain a safe online environment for users and to provide guidelines to our publishers, consumers and users, as well as to reflect evolving regulatory requirements in the digital sphere impacted by our services.

**IV. Content Moderation Reporting**

Under the DSA, content moderation is defined to mean activities, whether automated or not, undertaken by providers of intermediary services, that are aimed, in particular, at detecting, identifying and addressing illegal content or information incompatible with their terms and conditions, provided by recipients of the service, including measures taken that affect the availability, visibility, and accessibility of that illegal content or that information, such as demotion, demonetization, disabling of access to, or removal thereof, or that affect the ability of the recipients of the service to provide that information, such as the termination or suspension of a recipient’s account.

  

Essentially, content moderation refers to the practices and processes employed by online platforms to manage user-generated content, content creations and properties on their services. Mediavine has developed a content moderation process to ensure a secure online environment for both publishers and users. Mediavine employs data engineers, data analysts, and software developers to protect users from inappropriate and illegal content. These employees collectively help us drive both automated and manual content moderation processes.

  

Mediavine undertakes a review of the content utilizing its services to identify potential violations of our own internal standards and statutory law. There are various types of potential violations flagged and as a result website pages may be demonetized until publishers cure the violation. These violations include, but are not limited to:

  

\*Hacking

\*Software Pirating

\*Pornographic content

\*Containing, promoting, or linking to any form of illegal activity

\*Material that promotes violence or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, physical ability, mental ability, or age

\*Material that contains unlawful, indecent, incendiary, abusive, harassing, or otherwise objectionable content as determined in Mediavine’s sole discretion

\*Material that defames, abuses, or threatens physical harm to others

\*Material targeting end users under the age of 18

\*Inappropriate newsgroup postings, chat or forum abuse, or unsolicited e-mail (SPAM)

\*Torrent sites

\*Sites illegally distributing copyright protected content

\*Material that infringes or appears to infringe the intellectual property rights of any person or contravenes or appears to contravene any applicable laws, regulations, or code of conduct

\*Unmoderated user generated content

  

Mediavine has a reporting and complaints procedure to review potentially unlawful content. Users, publishers, and copyright holders have various legal remedies available if they do not agree with Mediavine’s decision to remove ads or content.

Mediavine, Inc. (“Mediavine”) respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same. To that end, in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 512, Mediavine has implemented procedures for reporting instances of copyright infringement.

If you are a copyright holder, or its authorized representative, and believe in good faith that content residing or accessible on or through the Mediavine ad network, any Mediavine website, or any of the Mediavine plug-ins infringes your copyrighted work, you may submit a notice of copyright infringement following the procedure below. If you provide sufficient evidence of potential infringement, we will provide the alleged infringer with information from your claim and will cease providing programmatic advertising to the applicable webpage containing the allegedly infringing materials or, if found on a Mediavine owned website, remove the content. We may resume advertising upon removal of the content by the alleged infringer or if a counter notice is filed and you fail to notify us of legal action as set forth below. Please note we cannot remove or disable any content on a website that is not owned by Mediavine or provide anonymity in this process. You should not file a takedown request if you wish to remain anonymous.

You may send the written notice of copyright infringement to our designated agent, whose contact information is listed below or submit a notice [**here:**](https://airtable.com/appxQJlZrtgjxICxi/shrG5BxlHPVk3r3ln)

The notice of copyright infringement should provide the following information:

1. A clear description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed (if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, you may provide a representative list of such works).
2. A description of the material that you claim is infringing. (Please be as detailed as possible and provide web addresses (URLs) leading directly to the material).
3. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the allegedly infringing material (Please be as detailed as possible and provide web addresses (URLs) leading directly to the material).
4. Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an e-mail address.
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.
7. Your physical or electronic signature (typing your full legal name is sufficient).

Please note that we may forward the notice of copyright infringement (or information contained therein), as well as the complainant’s contact information, to the party who posted the allegedly infringing content. Additionally, if we cease advertising on, or remove or disable access to, the content pursuant to a valid DMCA notice, Mediavine may immediately notify the owner of the content that the content has been demonetized, removed or disabled.

**Counter-Notification** If we have ceased providing programmatic advertising on your website or, when applicable, removed content from our website, due to submission of a DMCA request, you may file a counter-notification that contains the following details:

1. Identification of the material that Mediavine has removed or ceased running programmatic advertising on;
2. A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was demonetized or removed as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material in question;
3. Your name, address and telephone number;
4. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court: (i) in the judicial district where your address is located, or (ii) of Delaware, if your address is located outside the United States, and that you will accept service of process from the complainant who submitted the notice of infringement or his or her agent.

Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, Mediavine will promptly forward the counternotice (or the information contained therein) to the complainant who submitted the notice of infringement.

Please note it is also the policy of Mediavine, in appropriate circumstances and in our sole discretion, to suspend or terminate the accounts of publishers who are repeat copyright infringers.

If You utilize any other Mediavine product offerings, such as Mediavine Ad Management or PubNation, plug-ins, software, or WordPress frameworks, Your use of those offerings will be governed by the terms and conditions applicable to such product(s).**

**By utilizing Grow, including by registering for a Reader Account (as defined here), and clicking to accept to these terms, including by way of clicking the “Sign Up” or “Register” or similar button, You represent and acknowledge that You have read, understand, and agree to be legally bound by all of the terms, conditions, warranties, duties, and obligations set forth in this Agreement and that You are authorized to do so.

If You do not have such authority or do not wish to be bound to this Agreement, You must not sign up, register, utilize Grow, or otherwise click to accept.**

**ELIGIBILITY**

To utilize Grow as a visitor (“Reader”) to a Grow-enabled website (“Website(s)”), You must create a Grow Reader account (the “Reader Account”) and agree to this Agreement. If You choose to create a Reader Account, You agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself. Registration data and certain other information about You are governed by the Privacy Policy, and by agreeing to this Agreement you hereby consent to the use of such data and information by Mediavine as set forth in this Agreement and the Privacy Policy.

If at any time Mediavine discovers any information provided by You is inaccurate or false, Mediavine may immediately terminate this Agreement. Mediavine reserves, in Mediavine’s sole and absolute discretion, the right to determine Your eligibility to utilize Grow and/or a Reader Account.

**GROW AND READER ACCOUNTS**

**Grow.** Grow is an engagement tool (“Grow”) that can be used by either Website owners (“Site Owner(s)”) or Readers. This Agreement applies to the use of Grow by You as a Reader. If You are also a Site Owner and wish to use Grow in Your Site Owner capacity, then in addition to this Agreement, You must separately accept additional terms applicable to the use of Grow by a Site Owner. Grow provides for a universal log-in wherein a Reader may (1) bookmark or save content from one or more Websites (“Content”), and also to the ability to import content previously bookmarked or saved from other sources into Grow (“Saved Content”, encompassing both Content bookmarked or saved by a Reader through Grow or imported to Grow), consolidating all such materials in a single online location for ease of access; (2) favorite or “heart” Content with such interaction appearing on the Website; (3) connect the Reader’s social media accounts and enable sharing Content on Reader’s social media channels or with third parties via email; (4) subscribe to a Website’s mailing list; (5) search Content and Saved Content; (6) opt-in to receive recommended Content; (7) access exclusive Content; and (8) utilize other features or functions or enhancements that Mediavine may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make generally available (for clarity, the foregoing are collectively included in the Grow definition). Content shall include blog posts and all associated text, images, and video and any newsletters sent to You by the Website. As a Reader, You may have limited access to a Grow function generally referred to as the “Grow Publisher Portal.” Full access to the Grow Publisher Portal requires You to be a Site Owner and use Grow in Your Site Owner capacity. Any use of features You are able to access in the Grow Publisher Portal as a Reader is subject to this Agreement. While Mediavine may make additional features, functions, or enhancements to Grow and/or the Reader Account available now or in the future, You acknowledge and agree that Mediavine is under no obligation to do so.

**Reader Account.** When creating a Reader Account, You will be asked to provide Your email address. You may only create one Reader Account per email address. You will also need to either create a unique password for the Reader Account or utilize a magic link provided to the email address used to create the Reader Account. Should You utilize the magic link to create the Reader Account, You may subsequently either create a password under the Account - Tools tab in the Reader Account for future logins to the Reader Account or continue logging in through a magic link that is generated upon Your request. You may also create a Reader Account using Your Facebook or Google login information. In the event You utilize the Facebook or Google login option, You understand that You are also subject to Facebook’s and/or Google’s terms and conditions and privacy policies as well as this Agreement. Once You sign up for a Reader Account, You have the option to provide additional information. The Privacy Policy details how Mediavine handles any such information You choose to provide it.

**Access.** You may only use and access Your own Reader Account, and You may not provide another person with the username and password or any magic link to access Your Reader Account. You are responsible for keeping all login credentials to access the Reader Account confidential. Usernames and passwords are the property of Mediavine. You are solely and fully responsible and liable for any and all activities that occur through, or any use of, Your Reader Account, regardless of whether such use or activities are undertaken by You or a third party and whether or not authorized. You agree to immediately notify Mediavine if You suspect or believe that Your Reader Account has been compromised in any way, including any unauthorized use of Your username, password, any magic link, or any other breach of security. Mediavine reserves the right to seek any remedy available to protect Confidential Information (as defined herein) and Grow from unauthorized third-party access. Mediavine is not responsible for any unauthorized access to or alteration, damage, or failure to store any Saved Content or other data You submit or use in connection with a Reader Account or Grow.

**API.** Your use of Grow, including importing Saved Content, subscribing to Website mailing lists, and opting in to receive personalized Content recommendations, as well as the provision of personalized content suggestions and advertisements by Mediavine, may involve the use of one or more APIs by Mediavine or Site Owners. By using Grow, you hereby acknowledge the use of APIs and consent to the sharing of any data pertaining to You and Your use of Grow with the software or platform the APIs connect to and the operator or authorized user of the software or platform.

**Links.** As a convenience, Grow and Websites may contain links to third-party websites, goods, or services that are not owned or controlled by Mediavine (“Third-Party Links”). Mediavine has no control over and assumes no responsibility for the content, data management, privacy policies, or practices of any Third-Party Links.

Grow provides for a universal log-in wherein a Reader may (1) bookmark or save content from one or more Websites (“Content”), and also to the ability to import content previously bookmarked or saved from other sources into Grow (“Saved Content”, encompassing both Content bookmarked or saved by a Reader through Grow or imported to Grow), consolidating all such materials in a single online location for ease of access; (2) favorite or “heart” Content with such interaction appearing on the Website; (3) connect the Reader’s social media accounts and enable sharing Content on Reader’s social media channels or with third parties via email; (4) subscribe to a Website’s mailing list; (5) search Content and Saved Content; (6) opt-in to receive recommended Content; (7) access exclusive Content; and (8) utilize other features or functions or enhancements that Mediavine may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make generally available (for clarity, the foregoing are collectively included in the Grow definition). Content shall include blog posts and all associated text, images, and video and any newsletters sent to You by the Website. As a Reader, You may have limited access to a Grow function generally referred to as the “Grow Publisher Portal.” Full access to the Grow Publisher Portal requires You to be a Site Owner and use Grow in Your Site Owner capacity. Any use of features You are able to access in the Grow Publisher Portal as a Reader is subject to this Agreement.

You may also create a Reader Account using Your Facebook or Google login information. In the event You utilize the Facebook or Google login option, You understand that You are also subject to Facebook’s and/or Google’s terms and conditions and privacy policies as well as this Agreement. Once You sign up for a Reader Account, You have the option to provide additional information. The Privacy Policy details how Mediavine handles any such information You choose to provide it.

**Access.** You may only use and access Your own Reader Account, and You may not provide another person with the username and password or any magic link to access Your Reader Account.
