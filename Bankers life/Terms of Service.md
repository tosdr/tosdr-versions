Civ. Code § 1633.1 et seq.).

We will retain a record of your consent to receive documents by electronic transmission with your policy and account information.

Eligible policy documents including Required Information will be uploaded as PDF files to the Site for your review, and We will send you an email informing you when a new document is available to you within your account. You can change this default delivery method from ELECTRONIC DELIVERY to USPS MAIL DELIVERY at any time by signing into your account on the Site, navigating to the ‘Manage Account’ section and selecting the ‘View/Update Preferences’ page.

Please note that if you elect to receive documents through USPS MAIL DELIVERY, it will slow the speed at which we can complete certain steps in transactions with you, because we will first need to send the required notices or disclosures to you in paper format, and then wait until we receive corresponding documents from you or your acknowledgement of receipt of such notices or disclosures.

For existing users of the Site, your delivery preference is set as a default to USPS MAIL DELIVERY **only**. Existing users will be prompted to update their delivery preference to opt-in to ELECTRONIC DELIVERY (if desired) upon acceptance of these TERMS AND CONDITIONS. If you opt-in to electronic delivery, eligible policy documents including Required Information will be uploaded as PDF files to the Site for your review, and We will send you an email informing you when a new document is available to you within your account.

**The option to transact business electronically with COMPANY and its affiliates including receiving policy documents and Required Information electronically is voluntary. You do not have to consent to electronic delivery of your policy documents and Required Information.**

If you choose to receive your documents electronically, you agree that:

1. You have access to equipment and software through which you can access the Site, login to your account and view PDF documents;
2. We may use electronic records and signatures in our relationship with you; and
3. Electronic delivery of policy information and Required Information satisfies any requirement that such information be provided to you in writing.

Your consent will apply to any communication which we are legally permitted to provide to you electronically now or at any time in the future until such time that you withdraw your consent. It is your responsibility to timely review any electronically delivered policy documents and Required Information that is uploaded to the Site and made available to you within your account. You may need to take certain actions in response to these communications such as pay your policy premiums or provide Us with information missing from your transaction request such as requested policy changes or claims submissions.

We may choose to, or be required to continue to send you certain documents in paper via USPS mail rather than in electronic form. You should continue to review all paper communications that We send you. Please ensure that you keep your primary mailing address up to date. If We send you paper documents, it will have no impact on your paperless enrollment.

Accessing Your Documents  
We may deliver electronic documents and communications by any of the following means: (1) within your account on the Site; (2) to your designated email address; (3) via our mobile application(s); or (4) by requesting that you download a PDF file that contains the communication.

Continuing to access Our Sites electronically after receiving notice of the change reaffirms your consent
