Terms and Conditions
====================

This page explains our Terms of Service. When you use KidEverest, you’re agreeing to all the rules on this page.

**Terms Of Service**

Effective: November, 16, 2018

Welcome to KidEverest (“Site” or “Website”), a crowdfunding platform that empowers individuals of all ages to raise money online. KidEverest (“KidEverest,”) is owned and operated by KidEverest LLC. Please read these Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”) carefully before using the Site. By accessing or using our Site, you (“user”) agree to be bound by this agreement. If you do not agree, with these Terms, do not use this Site.

1. **Acceptance of Terms**

**For Users**

It is important that you go through these Terms so that you know what you can or cannot do on this Site. If you are under 13, go through the Terms with a parent or legal guardian so they can help you register. When you create an account and accept this agreement, you become a member. If you are under 13, this means that you accept the conditions below and that you confirm that your parent or a legal guardian has read and accepted the conditions.

**For Parents**

Contact us at hello@kideverest.com if you do not accept this agreement and you believe your child has already become a member of KidEverest. Members under 13 will not be able to proceed without parental permission, which is necessary to activate their fundraising capabilities.  In some cases, it will be deemed appropriate to grant permission through educational institutions. Until the appropriate level of parental consent is obtained your child will not be able to proceed to use the Site and cannot publish anything to the Internet.

KidEverest reserves the right to update the Terms at anytime without notice. Changes are effective immediately upon posting. We may contact you when changes are made but your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. By using and accessing our Site, you agree to our Terms and any other policies/legal notices that we post on our Site.

2. **Definitions and Description of Service**

KidEverest’s services include our website and any additional features, content, and functionality offered by us in connection with the Site.

* A “Visitor” is someone who is browsing through the Site.
* A “Team Member” is someone who registers an account and belongs to a team.
* A “Parent” is a legal parent or guardian or educational institution official (who has gained appropriate permission from a legal parent or guardian,) whose child has registered with the Site.
* A “Supporter” or “backer” is someone who gives or donates money to a fundraiser on the site.
* Team Members and parents are collectively referred to as “Members.” Valid and accurate completion of the registration process leads to “Membership.” Visitors and Members are referred to collectively as “Users” or “you.”

3. **Membership Obligations**

You agree to:

* Provide true, accurate, current, and complete information when using the site, not limited to information about yourself, your organizations, and your fundraising activities. You will maintain the accuracy of all information you provide to us by updating it promptly. You authorize us to make inquiries, either directly or through third parties, to validate the registration information of Parents. We reserve all rights to suspend or terminate your account, refuse any current or future use of the service, take legal action against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is not truthful about their identity, or presents inaccurate and incomplete information. However, you acknowledge that we cannot guarantee by 100% the accuracy of any information submitted by any User of the Site, nor any identity information about any User.
* Parents may only register their own children, unless they are the child’s legal guardian (collectively “Parent”). A Team Member’s membership may be terminated without warning, if we believe that the Team Member is impersonating a child. A Parent Membership (and concurrently an associated Child’s Membership) may be terminated without warning if we believe that you are under 18 years old or are not the legal Parent of any child you have approved for membership on this Site.

4. **Fees and Payments**

KidEverest is free to join. We do, however, charge fees for donations received. We update notification of those fees on our [How it Works](http://www.kideverest.com/how-it-works) page. We reserve the right to change the fees from time to time. Changes are effective immediately after we provide you with notice on the Site. We may also temporarily change the fees for our services for promotions. These changes are effective when we post it on the Site.

All funds from donors are processed through Stripe or PayPal, third-party payment processors. All contributions are made one-time only and are limited to an amount specified by the donor. Funds are transferred to an account setup by the Member or individual designated to receive fundraiser proceeds from a backer directly through Stripe or Paypal, in the total amount of money given to the fundraiser minus credit card and transaction fees charged by our payment processors. Due to the occasional failures of some credit cards, KidEverest cannot guarantee the full receipt of the amount. Organizations and individuals whose account is connected by Paypal or Stripe is responsible for taxes applicable based on their net income or gross receipts. In some cases, taxes can be exempt. You are encouraged to consult a qualified tax profession to assess you specific tax situation.

KidEverest campaigns are all or nothing. These campaigns must be fulfilled 100% of asking, or funds will be returned to the donors.

Refunds requested by donors are the responsibility of fundraising Parents and can be processed by Kid Everest admin is requested during an active fundraiser. Donations requested following the completion of the fundraiser after all funds are disbursed will be the responsibility of the fundraiser Parent and any affiliated organization. These refunds are not able to be processed through KidEverest after the fundraiser has completed because the funds have already been distributed to your bank account.

You are responsible for paying any fees associated with donations made through Kid Everest. A percentage-based transaction fee + credit card processing fee will be deducted from each online contribution received on Kid Everest. Contributions are subject to this fee one time-only. By launching your fundraiser, you agree to these terms. You will not be responsible for paying any fees if no money is received or donations are fully refunded.
