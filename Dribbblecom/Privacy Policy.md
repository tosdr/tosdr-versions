=========================================

Learn more about how Dribbble collects and uses data and your rights as a Dribbble user.

Updated March 12, 2024

### **INTRODUCTION**

Dribbble Holdings Limited (the “Dribbble Group”) is comprised of several companies, which together provide tools to help the world’s designers to create, develop and promote their talents (each a “Service” and collectively, the “Services”). The companies within the Dribbble Group each act as the data controller for personal data processed in respect of their Services (each a “Group Company” and together the “Group Companies”) and referred to as “our,” “we,” or “us” below. The data controllers for each Service are:

* **Dribbble** - Dribbble Holdings Ltd
    
* **Creative Market** - Creative Market Labs, Inc.
    
* **Fontspring** - Creative Market Labs, Inc.
    
* **Font Squirrel** - Creative Market Labs, Inc.
    

We know that you care about how your information is used and shared. This Privacy Policy provides details of the way in which the Group Companies process personal data in line with their obligations under relevant data protection law, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the **“GDPR”**), the California Consumer Privacy Act (the **“CCPA”**), and other applicable laws (collectively, **“Data Protection Law”**).

This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by the Group Companies when you use our Services, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. Note that certain third parties may be able to identify you across sites and services and over time using the information they process, however, any such processing not done at the direction of us is outside the scope of this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policies, content or security of any linked third party websites or services. We recommend that you check the privacy and security policies of each and every website and service that you visit.

### **INFORMATION WE PROCESS.**

The types of information we process depends on how you use our Services. Many of our Services require users to set up an account, which involves the collection and processing of your name and email address. Other Services may require the collection of additional information. For example, Dribbble helps to connect its community of designers with people and companies in need of their skills. In order to do so, Dribbble collects payments data and other information required to comply with relevant legal obligations.

The following table explains the types of information we collect and how we collect it. These categories of data may collectively be referred to as “Your Information”.

### Information we Create

Category

Example

Inference Data

Inference Data

Some Group Companies, certain partners, social media companies, and third parties operating on our behalf create and infer Your Information based on our observations or analysis of Your Information processed under this Policy, and we may correlate this data with other data we process about you. We may combine any of Your Information about you that we receive from you and from third parties.

The Dribbble Group will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes unless we first notify you or obtain your consent, to the extent required by Data Protection Law.

### **Sensitive Personal Data**

Data Protection Law recognises that certain types of information require additional protection. In particular, the GDPR prohibits the processing of sensitive personal data, other than in certain exceptional circumstances. Sensitive personal data in the EU includes information relating to one’s race or ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union, as well as biometric data and data relating to one’s health or sexual orientation. Certain state laws in the US also have different definitions of sensitive personal data.

We do not knowingly collect or process any sensitive personal data. However, some users may make such information public through their use of our Services. For example, Dribbble permits users to add a biography to their profile. This is a free-text section that allows users to include whatever information they wish, subject to complying with the relevant Terms of Service. Users are in control of what information they share and, to the extent they choose to make sensitive personal data public, they may delete or amend this information at any time.

### **HOW WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION AND OUR LEGAL BASES FOR DOING SO**

We collect and process Your Information whenever you use our Services. Consistent with relevant Data Protection Law, we are required to identify a legal basis for each of our processing activities.

Under EU law there are six different bases, which may be relied upon to enable the lawful processing of Your Information. In particular, data controllers may process personal data:

* where they have received freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent from a data subject (**“Consent”**);
    
* where processing is necessary to conclude and perform a contract (**“Contractual Necessity”**);
    
* where processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which they are subject (**“Legal Obligation”**); or
    
* in pursuit of the data controller’s legitimate interests, except where these interests are overridden by the rights and freedoms of individuals (**“Legitimate Interests”**).
    

Under the CCPA, we must disclose the purposes for which we collect your information:

* **Business Purposes**, which include auditing, security, debugging/repair, certain short-term uses, performing services, internal research for technical development, quality and safety maintenance and verification, as well as the use of Your Information for our operational purposes, or other notified purposes that use Your Information as reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the operational purpose; and
    
* **Commercial Purposes**, which include use of Your Information to advance our commercial or economic interests, such as encouraging others to buy, rent, lease, join, subscribe to, provide, or exchange products, goods, property, information, or services, or enabling or effecting, directly or indirectly, a commercial transaction.
    

The Group Companies primarily rely on Consent, Contractual Necessity, Legal Obligation and Legitimate Interests when processing Your Information. Below we explain the purposes for which we process this information, along with the relevant categories of data we use and the legal basis we rely on to do so (for purposes of the GDPR) or other permitted reasons for processing (e.g. Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes under the CCPA).

You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12 month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person we collected personal information on.
    
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.
    

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable request does not require you to create an account with us.

**Response Timing and Format**

We endeavour to respond to verifiable consumer requests within 45 days of receipt. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to you by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. If applicable, we will also provide reasons we cannot comply with your request. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or unfounded. If we determine a fee is warranted, we will provide you with an estimate before completing your request.

**Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights**

For the purposes of CCPA, we do not sell Your Information.

**Non-Discrimination**

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
    
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
    
* Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.
    
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level of quality of goods or services.
    

**Information**

California Civil Code Section §1798.83 permits users of the Site and/or Services who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [help@dribbble.com](mailto:help@dribbble.com) with “Request for California Privacy Information” in the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the requested information to you in your email address in response.

### **DATA SECURITY AND DATA BREACH**

We care about the integrity and security of Your Information and implement appropriate technical and organisational security measures to safeguard Your Information from unlawful or unauthorised destruction, loss, change, disclosure, acquisition or access.

Our Group Companies follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data provided to us, both during transmission and after it is received. Examples of our security measures include, as appropriate, physical measures such as locking access to servers, putting in place IT measures such as encryption, and restricting access to your information through approvals and passwords, so it is accessible only on a “need to know” basis.

Depending on the Group Company and the Service in question, your account information is protected by a password. You are responsible for carefully choosing and periodically changing an appropriately-strong password and for maintaining its secrecy. You are also responsible for controlling access to your email communications from our Group Companies, and for other security measures, such as signing out after using our Services.

Despite these measures, it is not possible to warrant the security of any information you transmit to our Group Companies or guarantee that your information on our Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our technical or organisational safeguards. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of our Group Companies’ distributors, such as social networks. We are not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.

### **DATA RETENTION**

We will keep personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which that personal data are processed, including to provide our Services. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis and will depend on several factors, including:

* The type of information and the purpose for which it is processed;
    
* Any legal requirement to retain the data, including where data was processed on the basis of a Legal Obligation or until the Statute of Limitations has elapsed with respect to possible legal claims or investigations;
    
* Whether the data is required for Trust & Safety purposes. For example, where users breach our Terms of Service, we may terminate their account and prevent them from accessing our Services, in order to protect other users. In such circumstances, it may be necessary to retain certain personal data, even after account termination.
    

Following termination or deactivation of your User account, we may retain the Information You Provide for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, contract performance and enforcement, or audit purposes but for no longer than is necessary and only where the information is accurate and relevant for our use. Furthermore, we may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information contained in your communications to other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your User account. However, we will only keep this information on the Services where it was posted and will not use this information for any other purpose.
