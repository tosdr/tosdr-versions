Cookies policy

Our cookie policy
=================

This Cookie Policy takes effect on June 3, 2022. Last updated on August 1, 2023.

Information about our use of cookies and similar technologies
-------------------------------------------------------------

Dribbble Holdings Limited (the “Dribbble Group,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) wants to make sure you understand how cookies and other similar technologies are used by us on our websites dribbble.com, creativemarket.com, fontspring.com, fontsquirrel.com, and any subdomains thereof (which we may refer to as the “Sites”) and by our partners. These technologies have several purposes (including third-party advertising). Our Sites use cookies and similar technologies to distinguish you from other users of our Sites. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Sites and also allows us to improve our Sites. By continuing to browse any of our Sites, you are agreeing to our use of cookies and similar technologies as described in this Policy.

Types of technologies that we use
---------------------------------

**Cookies:** A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information. Those cookies are set by us and called “first-party cookies”. We also use “third-party cookies” – which are cookies originating from a domain different from the domain of the website you are visiting (e.g., one of our Sites) – generally for our advertising and marketing efforts. More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes: to enable our Sites to function and maintain security (for example, shopping cart functionality, security, customer support); to track, measure, and improve performance of our Sites; allow personalization of our Sites; and to target our own ads to prior visitors of our Sites on third party websites (see below on “Why We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies”).

* A **persistent cookie** remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to one of our Sites until you choose to delete them, and otherwise typically delete themselves at expiration. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions.
    
* A **session cookie** is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
    
* A **third-party cookie** is placed by someone other than the Dribbble Group, and may gather browsing activity across multiple websites and across multiple sessions. They are usually a type of persistent cookie and are stored until you delete them or they expire based on the time set in each third-party cookie.
    

You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of our service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. For more information about cookies, you may visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**Log File Information:** Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use one of our Sites, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Sites, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

**Web Beacons/Clear GIFs Information:** Our Sites have buttons or icons provided by third-party social media providers (e.g., Facebook, Pinterest, and LinkedIn) that allow you to interact with those social media services when you interact with our Sites. Those social widgets may collect browsing data, including through cookies and similar technologies, which may be received by the third party that provided the widget, and are controlled by those third-parties. Please review the privacy policy and privacy settings of the applicable social media property before using such features on our Sites.

**Social Network Widgets:** Our Service has buttons or icons provided by third-party social media providers (e.g., Facebook, Pinterest, and LinkedIn) that allows you to interact with those social media services when you interact with our Service. Those social widgets may collect browsing data, including through cookies and similar technologies, which may be received by the third party that provided the widget, and are controlled by those third-parties. Please review the privacy policy and privacy settings of the applicable social media property before using such features on our Service.

Why We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies
-------------------------------------------

We use cookies and similar technologies described above to recognize your logged-in state on the Sites, to understand what purchases members and visitors are interested in, to make our Sites function for you, and to help your browsing experience and use of the Sites feel more customized, as further described:

* **Strictly necessary.** These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Sites or to provide the services requested by you. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Sites, use a shopping cart, or make use of e-billing services.
    
* **Functional.** These are used to recognize you when you return to our Sites. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
    
* **Analytical/performance.** They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Sites when they are using the Sites. This helps us to improve the way our Sites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
    
    * Google Analytics: The Site also uses Google Analytics to help understand how our Service is used by its community. For some of the advertising features listed below, like retargeting, data from Google Analytics may be combined with our first-party data and third-party cookies (like Google’s advertising cookies). See here for how Google uses data when you use our Service and how you may opt out ([www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://dribbble.com/www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)).
        
    * Other Analytics Providers. We also use other third-party analytics services, including LinkedIn Analytics, Sift, and Segment. We use these analytics providers to help understand use of the Sites. These analytics services collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address, and their use of this information is governed by their privacy policies. You can find links to their privacy policies below, in the “Managing Cookies Technologies” section.
        
* **Social Networks.** These are used to enable you to interact with third-party social-networks when logged into our Sites (subject to any preferences you set with those third-parties). Social networks may also work with us or with you for analytics or for marketing purposes, as discussed below. You may be able to manage your privacy preferences for these social networks and their tools and widgets via your account with the social network. You can find links to their privacy policies below in the “Managing Cookies Technologies” section.
    
* **Targeting and Marketing.** For third party advertising on our Sites (e.g., Font Squirrel), third parties that deliver ads on our Sites use cookies on our Sites with our permission to uniquely distinguish your web browser and keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the web pages on which the ads appeared in order to provide ads on our Sites that we hope will be of interest to you. We also work with third-parties to target advertising for our Sites on the third-party websites. These cookies record your visit to our Sites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our Sites more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose. These third-party service providers may use various cookies and similar technology to permit us and them to show you ads on third-party websites. These may include things such as:
    
    * Frequency capping, which limits the number of times a user’s browser or mobile device displays the same ad;
        
    * Attribution tracking, which estimates what advertising or marketing source brought someone to our Sites, or determines what marketing source led to actions like a visit or a purchase;
        
    * Remarketing, which shows relevant ads to an audience based on prior shopping and browsing patterns on our Sites;
        
    * Audience targeting, which refers to targeting advertisements to a large audience based on the audience’s known or inferred demographics; and
        
    * Cross-device recognition, which recognizes actions across multiple devices or browsers.
        

Some third-party service providers may provide information like demographics, cross-device information, or interest categories from a combination of sources that, while not identifying you personally, permit us to provide you with more relevant and useful advertising. In some cases, this information may have non-marketing performance analytics uses as well. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you visit our Sites or other websites and mobile applications based on data like a cookie, your IP address, or device ID, but do not allow access to other personal information from our Sites. However, these technologies may allow us or a third party to recognize you, either from a single device or across devices, over time. These third parties are required to follow applicable laws, self-regulatory programs, and our data protection rules where applicable. However, Dribbble Group does not have control over these third parties, who each have their own privacy policies and privacy practices.

You can find links to their privacy policies below in the “Managing Cookies Technologies” section.

Consent, Contract, and Legitimate Interests in Processing
---------------------------------------------------------

These include the functions strictly necessary to the service noted above.
