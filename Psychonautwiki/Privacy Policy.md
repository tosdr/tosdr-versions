To fulfill this guiding narrative, we obligate ourselves to the following, legally binding guarantees:

1. We will never keep logs at any component of our infrastructure.
2. Your IP is anonymized at all times.
3. Our servers are physically protected and located in a camera monitored [data center in Falkenstein, Germany](http://www.datacenterpark.de/) operated by Hetzner Online.
4. Your information is legally protected by German laws. In Germany, gag orders do not exist. Should we ever receive a court order, we will do our best not to comply and publish every single one immediately on the Main\_Page or a designated, from the Main\_Page linked article. We will at any times promptly inform users targeted by law enforcement or any litigation.
5. We will only publish volunteered information about you and your identity. We will do our best to comply with deletion requests.
6. We will never sell nor share in any way any information about our users to anyone.
7. We have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor on our platform.
8. We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will.
9. Although every change is recorded and publicly visible, we can update this privacy policy effective immediately at any times without notifying you.

  

In addition to request processing, your data is used in the following places:

1. We use **Google Analytics**, **Facebook Analytics**, **Yandex.Metrika** and **Countly** to track usage of our platform, allowing us to edit missing, broken or outdated information and proactively curate content based on usage.
2. From time to time, we may be running private experiments changing the representation or behaviour of the site based on usage. Therefore, parts, or all, of the recorded user data may be used to segment users and derive, induce or deduce, behavioural classes and patterns, reflecting the interests and motivations of a user, that may be used to form meaningful target groups.
3. Using collected, anonymized data, we may develop features that take advantage of this and improve the user experience for everyone.
4. We may include anonymized and sampled information in public reports about the progress of PsychonautWiki.
