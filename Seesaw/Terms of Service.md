* [International End User Terms](https://seesaw.com/end-user-terms-international/)

Welcome to the online service of Seesaw Learning, Inc. (“**Seesaw**,” “**we**,” or “**us**“). These terms of service (these “**Terms**“) explain the terms by which Customers and their Authorized Users (as such terms are defined below) may use our online and/or mobile services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the service and platform (collectively, the “**Services**“). By (a) accessing or using the Services, (b) signing an order form with Seesaw (a “**Service Order**“) specific to you or your organization, or (c) clicking a button or checking a box marked “I Agree” (or something similar), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and the Service Order which is hereby incorporated by reference (collectively, the “**Agreement**“), whether or not you are a registered user of our Services. Seesaw reserves the right to modify these Terms and will provide notice of material changes as described below. 

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 12.2 AND A JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION IN SECTION 12.3 THAT REQUIRE THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US, INCLUDING ANY CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED BEFORE YOU AGREED TO THESE TERMS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS, AS WELL AS YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. 

**NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SUPERSEDES OR LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER (1) THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT YOU OR YOUR INSTITUTION HAVE ENTERED INTO WITH SEESAW REGARDING THE USE OF SERVICES, OR (2) APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS TO THE EXTENT THESE TERMS ARE PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAWS OR REGULATIONS. IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN THESE TERMS AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AN APPLICABLE WRITTEN AGREEMENT YOU OR YOUR INSTITUTION HAVE ENTERED INTO WITH SEESAW, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT SHALL CONTROL.**

If you subscribe to, or access or use the Services, create an organization, invite users to that organization, or use or allow use of that organization after being notified of a change to these Terms, you acknowledge your understanding of the then-current Agreement and agree to the Agreement on behalf of Customer. Please make sure, if you agree on behalf of Customer, you have the necessary authority to enter into the Agreement on behalf of Customer before proceeding.

1\. **General Provisions**

1.1 **Eligibility**

This is a contract between you and Seesaw. You must read and agree to these Terms before using the Services. If you do not agree, you may not use the Services. You may use the Services only if you can form a legally binding contract with us, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations (“**Applicable Law**“).

Customers are responsible for all Students’ and Family Members’ activities on the Services and for ensuring that all Teachers and Family Members (each as defined below) agree to the applicable [End User Terms](https://seesaw.com/end-user-terms/) (these End User Terms apply if you are in the United States, and these [End User Terms](https://seesaw.com/end-user-terms-international/) apply if you are anywhere else). The Services are not available to any users we previously removed from the Services.

1.2 **Customers, Authorized Users, and User Content**

“**Customer**” or “**you**” is the school, school district, school governing body, local authority or other body authorized to enter into agreements for the supply of services to schools, in each case that you represent in agreeing to the Agreement. Solely with respect to subscriptions to our Seesaw Plus Membership (as defined below) as used herein “Customer” means the Teacher subscribed to the Seesaw Plus Membership. If Customer’s organization is being set up by someone who is not formally affiliated with a business entity or other organization, Customer is the individual creating the organization. If you signed up for a plan on behalf of a business entity or other organization, the business entity or other organization on whose behalf you signed up is the Customer. By signing up on behalf of your business entity or other organization, you represent and warrant that you have all right, power, and authority to bind such entity or organization to the Agreement. Customer may allow access and provide accounts to the Services to its employees, faculty and administrators (collectively, “**Teachers**“) to permit such Teachers to access and use the Services, as a part of Customer’s permitted use and implementation of the Services. 

Customer may authorize individuals to access the Services, including, without limitation, Teachers, students enrolled in classes provided by Customer’s Teachers (“**Students**“), and parents or legal guardians of those Students (“**Family Members**“) (each of Teachers, Students, and Family Members, an “**Authorized User**“). Customer will be solely responsible for all of the acts and omissions of its Authorized Users in relation to the Services and the Agreement. 

Customers and Authorized Users may provide content through the Services (including any activities that an Authorized User publishes to a public Community Activity Library or an Activity Library managed by the Customer) that consists of images, comments, questions, information, documents, spreadsheets, and any other content submitted, posted, or otherwise made available by Customer and its Authorized Users through the Services (“**User Content**“), and Customer will have the sole right and responsibility for managing use of all User Content of its Authorized Users. 

Customer will (i) inform Authorized Users of all Customer policies and practices that are relevant to their use of the Services and of any settings that may impact the processing of User Content; (ii) ensure that all Teachers and Family Members agree to and comply with the provisions of the applicable End User Terms that apply to their use of the Services, and (iii) obtain all rights, permissions or consents from Authorized Users and other Customer personnel that are necessary to grant the rights and licenses in the Agreement and for the lawful use and transmission of User Content and Customer’s and the Authorized Users’ use of the Services.

1.3 **Accounts**

* (a)   Your User Account. Your account or your Authorized Users’ accounts on the Services (your “**User Account**“) give you and your Authorized Users access to certain services and functionalities that we may, in our sole discretion, establish and maintain as part of the Services from time to time. We may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of users.
* (b)   Connecting Via Third-Party Services. The Service allows for integrations with third-party apps or tools to provide certain features. When using integrations with third-party services, you acknowledge that you will be governed by their terms. By connecting to the Services via a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your and your Authorized Users’ information from that service, as permitted by that service, and to store log-in credentials and/or access tokens for that service.
    * Google OAuth and Google Classroom: Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any use of Google OAuth to login to your User Account and any use of Google Classroom as integrated with the Services, you agree to comply with the [Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms) and such other terms and conditions as Google may provide from time to time.
    * Youtube: YouTube’s Application Programming Interface (“YouTube API”) allows users to access information about YouTube videos (e.g., video thumbnail images and video titles) from the Seesaw website. This use is governed by the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy).
* (c)   Account Security. Customer or its Authorized Users may never use another user’s User Account without such user’s permission. When creating a User Account, you must (and must ensure that your Authorized Users) provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your User Account, and the User Accounts of your Authorized Users, you will keep (and will ensure your Authorized Users keep) your/their User Account password(s) and/or any other authentication credentials secure, and you will not share (and will ensure your Authorized Users do not share) your/their password(s) and/or any other authentication credentials with anyone else. We encourage you to use [“strong” passwords](https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/articles/12981357301517-How-to-create-a-strong-password) (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols) to protect your User Account. Any Authorized User with administrator-level access to a Customer’s User Account can modify the User Account settings, access, and billing information. We will not be liable for, and expressly disclaim liability for, any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your or any of your Authorized Users’ User Account and/or any changes to your or any of your Authorized Users’ User Account, including, without limitation, changes made by any Authorized User with administrator-level access to your User Account. You will notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your or any of your Authorized Users’ User Account.
* (d)   Account Settings. Customer and each Authorized User may control certain aspects of your/their respective User Accounts and any associated user profile, and of the way you/they interact with the Services, by changing the settings in your/their settings page. By providing us with your email address, you agree to our using that email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by Applicable Law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use that email address to send you other messages, including, without limitation, marketing and advertising messages, such as messages notifying you of changes to features of the Services and special offers (collectively, “**Marketing Emails**“) in accordance with your preferences and subject to any restrictions under applicable law. If you do not want to receive Marketing Emails, you may opt out of receiving them at any time or change your preferences on the services, by contacting the Services support team at [https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/requests/new) or by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link within a Marketing Email. Opting out will not prevent you from receiving Service-related notices.

1.4 **Account Creation**

Only Teachers and Customers, with administrator level access, are permitted to create a class on the Services. For clarity, Students and Family Members are not permitted to create classes via the Services. Once the class is created, Teachers can invite Students, additional faculty, and Family Members to the class. Teachers control who can upload, view, comment on, and share Student work and they can change these permissions at any time. When Customer or a Teacher creates a Seesaw class, as applicable, you represent and warrant that:

* a. Any Students added to such class are current Students in the class.
* b. Any additional Teachers added to such class are Authorized Users and are authorized by Customer to access data of the Authorized Users associated with that class.
* c. Customer and Teachers will use Seesaw only for lawful purposes and each will abide by applicable laws and school and school district policies.
* d. Customer and Teachers will treat Seesaw as an extension of the classroom and take reasonable steps to confirm that Students are using Seesaw appropriately.
* e. Customer and Teachers will take reasonable measures to protect access to users’ data accessible through the Services.
* f. Customer and Teachers will only invite Family Members who are authorized to access a student’s educational records to view Student journals and Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for the consequences of providing such Family Members access to Student journals and personal information through the Services.
* g. Customer and Teachers will protect your class QR code so that access to Student journals and class journals is limited only to invited Students and Family Members.

1.5 **Changes, Suspension, and Termination**. You may de-activate your User Account at any time. We may, with or without prior notice, change the Services, stop providing the Services or features of the Services to you, to any of your Authorized Users, or to users generally, or create usage limits for the Services. We may, with or without prior notice, permanently terminate or temporarily suspend your access to your or any of your Authorized Users’ User Accounts and/or the Services without liability, with or without cause, and for any or no reason, including if, in our sole determination, you or any of your Authorized Users, as applicable, violates any provision of these Terms. Upon their termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by these Terms.

1.6 **Your Interactions with Other Users**. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR AND YOUR AUTHORIZED USERS’ INTERACTIONS, INCLUDING SHARING OF INFORMATION, WITH OTHER USERS, INCLUDING STUDENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, BUT HAVE NO OBLIGATION, TO MONITOR DISPUTES BETWEEN CUSTOMER, AUTHORIZED USERS, AND OTHER USERS. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY ARISING FROM CUSTOMER’S INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS, AND FOR ANY AUTHORIZED USER’S ACTION OR INACTION, INCLUDING RELATING TO USER CONTENT.

1.7 **Beta Products**  
Occasionally, we look for beta testers to help us test our new features. These features will be identified as “beta” or “pre-release,” or words or phrases with similar meanings (each, a “**Beta Product**“). Beta Products are made available on an “as is,” and “as available” basis and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, without any warranties, liabilities, or contractual commitments we make for other Services.

1.8 **Feedback**  
Customer and Authorized Users may choose to, or we may invite you or them to, submit comments or ideas about the Services, including without limitation about how to improve the Services or our products (“**Feedback**“). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that your and your Authorized Users’ disclosures are gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place us under any fiduciary or other obligation, and you hereby assign (and you will procure that all Authorized Users assign) all right, title, and interest in and to the Feedback without any additional compensation by us, whether to Customer, the Authorized User, or anyone else, and/or to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of the submission, we do not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to us, or developed by our personnel, or obtained from sources other than Customer or Authorized Users.

2\. **Services Usage and Restrictions**

2.1 **Our License to Customer**

* (a)   Ownership of the Services, Documentation, and Derivative Data. We (and our licensors) own and will continue to own our Services and Documentation (as defined below) including all related intellectual property and other proprietary rights related thereto. Further, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect data relating to your and your Authorized Users’ usage of the Services, including but not limited to log data related to your and your Authorized Users’ access to and use of the Services and the devices used to access and use the Services (“**Usage Data**“) and collect, analyze, and use data derived from User Content that has been aggregated and/or anonymized such that it does not identify Customer, Authorized User, or any identifiable individual person (“**Derivative Data**“). All Derivative Data will be owned solely and exclusively by us and, for purposes of clarity, you agree that we may use the Derivative Data in perpetuity for any purpose permitted by applicable law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We may, from time to time, make available certain third-party products and services, including but not limited to open-source software (“**Third-Party Products**“) for use in connection with the Services. Such Third-Party Products may be made available under separate or additional terms and conditions, including but not limited to open-source licenses, which we will make available to you as necessary.
* (b)   Licenses to the Services and Documentation. During the Term (as defined below), we grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use, and to permit Authorized Users to access and use, the Services, in accordance with the Agreement, for your own education purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  To the extent that we may make downloadable software components available, via app stores or other channels, as part of the Services, during the Term, we grant to you a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license for you and Authorized Users to use the object code version of these components, but solely as necessary to use the Services. Minor updates, bug fixes, and the like to such downloadable software components will be included under this license for the duration of the Term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   From time to time we may make available product documentation for the Services (the “**Documentation**“) via a method of our choosing (_e.g._, via the Services). During the Term, we grant to you a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license for you and your Authorized Users to use the Documentation to support your and your Authorized Users’ use of the Services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     All rights and licenses granted herein are subject to your and your Authorized Users’ full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement. All rights in the Services and Documentation not expressly granted herein are expressly reserved by us.  
    

2.2 **Customer’s Licenses to Us**

* (a)   Ownership of User Content. As between us on the one hand, and Customer on the other, you will own all User Content.
* (b)  License to User Content. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, you (for yourself and all of your Authorized Users, as applicable) represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant (including any necessary consents and authorizations from individual persons identified in the User Content and licenses from third-parties whose content is included in the User Content), to us a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, license to access, use, host, store, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, translate, process, copy, distribute, perform, export, display, and make derivative works of all User Content, and the names, voice, and/or likeness contained in the User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, (i) to provide, improve, enhance, develop, maintain and offer products or services; (ii) to prevent or address service, security, support or technical issues; (iii) as required by law; and (iv) as expressly permitted in writing by you. Customer represents and warrants that it has secured all rights in and to User Content from its Authorized Users or any third parties as may be necessary to grant this license.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that we may collect, analyze, use and disclose, during or after the Term (as defined below), data derived from User Content, which is anonymized and/or aggregated in a manner that makes the identification of Customer or any Authorized User or third party impossible, for any business purpose, including without limitation, to operate, analyze, improve, and market the Services and our other products and services and share such anonymized data with our affiliates and business partners. You further agree that we will have the perpetual right to use, store, transmit, distribute, modify, copy, display, sublicense, and create derivative works of such derived data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         To the extent permitted under applicable law, we take no responsibility and assume no liability for any User Content that Customer or any Authorized User or third-party submits, posts, or otherwise makes available through the Services. As between you and us, you shall be fully responsible for your (including your Authorized Users’) User Content and the consequences of submitting, posting, or otherwise making it available via the Services, and you acknowledge and agree that we are acting only as a passive conduit for Customer’s and Authorized Users’ online distribution of such User Content.  
    

2.3 **Responsibilities for User Content**

We are not responsible for the content of any User Content or the way Customer or Authorized Users choose to use the Services to store or process any User Content. You represent and agree that you are solely responsible for (i) providing notices and obtaining consents as legally required for the collection, use, processing and transfer of User Content in connection with the Services; and (ii) ensuring compliance with all laws in all jurisdictions that may apply to User Content provided hereunder, including but not limited to all applicable international, federal, state, provincial and local laws, rules, and regulations relating to data privacy and security. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, you may not submit any User Content that includes a social security number, passport number, driver’s license number, or similar identifier, credit card or debit card number, or any other information which may be subject to specific data privacy and security laws including, but not limited to, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HiTECH). We do not make any representations as to the adequacy of the Services to process your User Content or to satisfy any legal or compliance requirements which may apply to your User Content, other than as described herein.

2.4 **Use of the Services**

Customer must comply with the Agreement and ensure that all Teachers and Family Members comply with the applicable End User Terms. We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we have no obligation to do so. If we believe there is a violation of the Agreement that can be remedied by removal of certain User Content, we will, in most cases, ask you to take direct action rather than intervene. However, to the extent legally permissible, we reserve the right to take further appropriate action, when we deem it reasonably appropriate if you do not take appropriate action, or if we believe there is a credible risk of: (i) harm to us, the Services, other users, or any third parties; or (ii) infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights.

2.5 **Acceptable Use**

* (a)   Technical Restrictions. You agree not to engage , and to ensure that none of the Authorized Users engage, in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) disassembling, reverse engineering, decoding, or decompiling any part of the Services; (ii) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Services in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (iii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Services in a manner that sends more request messages to the servers hosting the Services than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser; (iv) transmitting spam, chain letters, repetitive messages, or other unsolicited advertising or marketing email, messages or content; (v) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Services; (vi) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vii) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Services; (viii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Services; (ix) using the Services for any commercial solicitation purposes; (x) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (xi) interfering with the proper working of the Services; (xii) using or displaying the Services in competition with us, to develop competing products or services, for benchmarking or competitive analysis of the Services, or otherwise to our detriment or disadvantage; (xiii) accessing any content on the Services through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Services; (xiv) identify or refer to us or to the Services in a manner that could reasonably imply a relationship that involves endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship between you (or a third party) and us without our prior express written consent; or (xv) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Services, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Services or the content therein.
* (b)   User Content Restrictions. You are solely responsible for the content of any User Content you or any Authorized Users submit through the Services. You agree not to submit, or allow Authorized Users to submit, any User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, obscene, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current; or (ix) to the extent applicable, violates any school or other applicable policy, including those related to cheating or ethics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You agree that any User Content that you submit does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any intellectual property rights or rights of privacy or publicity. To the extent legally permissible, we reserve the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates any of these provisions. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Services is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor communications transmitted through the Services. We shall have no liability whatsoever for your interactions with other users (including with Authorized Users), or for any user’s action or inaction.

3\. **Payment Obligations**

3.1 **Billing Policies; Taxes.** Certain aspects of the Services may be provided for free, while certain other aspects of the Services may be provided for a fee or other charge (“**Fee**“).  By electing to use non-free aspects of the Services, including enrolling in a plan via execution of a Service Order, Customer agrees to the pricing and payment terms applicable to Customer and as described in the Service Order. The type of plan identified in Customer’s Service Order will determine the payment terms that apply to Customer’s subscription. Depending on the plan identified in Customer’s Service Order, Customer may be a part of the Seesaw Plus program (a “**Seesaw Plus Member**”), or Customer may be a part of a premium Seesaw program, including Seesaw for Schools, Seesaw Instructions and Insights, or other premium offering (a “**Seesaw Premium Member”**). We may add new products and/or services for additional Fees, add or amend Fees for existing products and/or services, and/or discontinue offering certain aspects of the Services at any time, in our sole discretion; provided, however, that if we have agreed to a specific Term and a corresponding Fee, then that will remain in force for that Fee during that Term unless otherwise provided in the Service Order. Except as may be expressly stated in these Terms or in the Service Order, all Fees must be paid in advance, payment obligations are non-cancelable once incurred (subject to any cancellation rights set forth in these Terms), and Fees paid are non-refundable. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use, and withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, but, for clarity, excluding taxes based on our net income, “**Taxes**“). Customer will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases in connection with the Services.

3.2 **Your Payment Method**

* (a)   General. Unless otherwise granted specified payment terms to process check or ACH or otherwise stated in a Service Order, to use non-free aspects of the Services, Customer must provide us with at least one (1) current, valid payment card that is accepted by us and the third-party payment processor we use, currently Stripe, Inc., which we engage to process payments Customers make in connection with the Services (“Payment Processor”) (each such card, a “Payment Method”). By providing a Payment Method, Customer authorizes each of Seesaw and Payment Processor to charge that Payment Method the applicable Fees and Taxes, including, if applicable, on a recurring basis until Customer cancels its plan under the applicable Service Order. Fees and Taxes will be charged to Customer’s Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the Customer’s Service Order. In some cases, Customer’s payment date may change, for example, if its Payment Method has not successfully settled, if Customer changed its plan, or if the term of the Service Order began on a date not contained in a subsequent term. The length of Customer’s billing cycle will depend on the terms specified in the Service Order. Fees are fully earned upon payment. We may authorize Customer’s Payment Method in anticipation of Service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to one (1) month of service as soon as Customer registers for the Services. If Customer is granted terms to process check or ACH or otherwise stated in a Service Order, all fees are due within thirty (30) days after the invoice date.
* (b)   Third-Party Payment Processor. We or Payment Processor will attempt to verify Customer’s Payment Method(s), and may do so by processing an authorization hold, which is standard practice. To the extent Payment Processor processes payments made by Customer, Customer will be subject to terms and conditions governing the use of Payment Processor’s service. Please review such terms and conditions as well as Payment Processor’s privacy notice (each of which is available on Payment Processor’s website). Customer acknowledges and understands that Payment Processor may collect and retain third-party Fees whenever Customer pays Fees. Payment must be received by Payment Processor before our acceptance of an order. We do not view or store Customer’s full credit card or other Payment Method information. For all payments, Payment Processor will collect Customer’s Payment Method details and charge its chosen Payment Method in connection with an order. If any of Customer’s account, order, or Payment Method information changes, Customer will promptly update such information, so that we or Payment Processor may complete Customer’s transaction(s) and/or contact Customer, as needed.
* (c)   Payment Representations and Warranties. Customer represents and warrants that: (i) the account, order, and Payment Method information it supplies to us and/or to Payment Processor, as applicable, is true, accurate, correct, and complete; (ii) it is duly authorized to use the Payment Method(s); (iii) it will pay any and all charges incurred by users of its Payment Method in connection with the Services, including any applicable Fees (at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred) and Taxes; (iv) charges incurred by Customer will be honored by its Payment Method company; (v) Customer will not allow or enable anyone else to use its User Account (including, without limitation, by sharing its password(s) or any other authentication credentials with anyone else, or by attempting to transfer its plan or User Account to anyone else); and (vi) Customer will report to us any unauthorized or prohibited access to or use of its User Account and/or password(s) or other authentication credentials.
* (d)   Disclaimer. WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO, AND CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (I) ANY SECURITY OR PRIVACY BREACHES RELATED TO CUSTOMER’S CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD, (II) ANY FEES THAT MAY BE CHARGED TO CUSTOMER BY ITS BANK IN CONNECTION WITH THE COLLECTION OF FEES, AND/OR (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OF CUSTOMER’S CREDIT CARD, DEBIT CARD, OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD BY A THIRD PARTY.

3.3 **General Subscription Plans**

**This Section 3.3 only applies to Customers who are Seesaw Premium Members. If you are a Seesaw Plus Member, this Section does not apply to you; please see Section 3.4 instead.**

If Customer obtains a subscription as a Seesaw Premium Member, it will be charged the applicable subscription fee annually plus any applicable taxes and other charges (“**Subscription Fee**”), at the beginning of the subscription term set out in the Service Order and each year thereafter at the then-current Subscription Fee. BY PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION TO SEESAW PREMIUM, CUSTOMER AUTHORIZES SEESAW TO INITIATE RECURRING NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS AS SET FORTH HEREIN. If Customer purchases a subscription as a Seesaw Premium Member, we (or our third-party Payment Processor) will automatically charge Customer each year during the applicable Subscription Term using the Payment Method Customer has provided until it cancels its subscription or does not renew its subscription as set out below. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a subscription, Customer acknowledges that its subscription has recurring payment features and Customer accepts responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to termination or cancellation of its subscription by Customer or Seesaw, as permitted herein. Customer’s subscription continues for the term set forth in its Service Order. No less than thirty (30) days before Customer’s subscription term as is set out in its Service Order ends, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law, Seesaw will send Customer a reminder email regarding its subscription. To renew Customer’s subscription, Customer must fill out and submit a self-serve renewal form found in the renewal email sent before the end of subscription or contact us or an authorized Seesaw representative requesting renewal of its subscription. By filling out the Self-Serve Renewal, Customer authorizes us to continue charging the Subscription Fees set forth in its Service Order and pursuant to these Terms. Customer must submit the Self-Serve Renewal or otherwise contact us or an authorized Seesaw representative prior to the end of the then current term set forth in its Service Order in order to renew Customer’s subscription as a Seesaw Premium Member. If Customer fails to submit the Self-Serve Renewal or to renew its subscription by contacting us or an authorized Seesaw representative prior to the day after the last day of its then current term, Customer’s subscription as a Seesaw Premium Member will expire, the Term (as defined below) will end, and Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ access to the relevant features and functionalities of the Services will end.

3.4 **Seesaw Plus Subscription Plans**

**This Section 3.4 applies to Customers who are Seesaw Plus Members only. If you are not a Seesaw Plus Member then this Section does not apply to you.**

* (a)   Automatic Renewals. Subscriptions are available on an automatically renewing subscription basis and entail payment of Fees on a subscription basis (“**Subscription Fees**“).  CUSTOMER’S SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM IDENTIFIED IN ITS SUBSCRIPTION ORDER FOR SUBSEQUENT TERMS EQUAL IN LENGTH TO THAT INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION TERM (EACH SUCH PERIOD, A “**SUBSCRIPTION TERM**“) UNLESS AND UNTIL CUSTOMER CANCELS THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CANCELLATION PROCEDURES IDENTIFIED IN SECTION 3.4(C) (INCLUDING ANY NOTICE PERIOD SPECIFIED IN SECTION 3.4(C) (CANCELLATION PROCEDURES)).
* (b)   Automatic Billing and Policies. When Customer enrolls in a subscription, Customer expressly acknowledges and agrees that:  (i) each of Seesaw and Payment Processor is authorized to charge Customer, at the beginning of each Subscription Term, the Subscription Fee for the applicable subscription, any applicable Taxes, and any other charges Customer may incur in connection with such subscription, subject to adjustment in accordance with these Terms; and (ii) Customer’s subscription is continuous until the earlier of:  (A) Customer’s cancellation of such subscription (including any notice period specified in Section 3.4(c) (Cancellation Procedures)) and (B) the suspension, discontinuation, or termination of Customer’s access to such subscription or to the Service in accordance with these Terms.  Customer understands and acknowledges that the amounts billed may vary due to changes to the Subscription Fee in accordance with Customer’s User Account or the Service Order, and/or changes in applicable Taxes, and Customer authorizes each of Seesaw and Payment Processor to charge its Payment Method the changed amounts.
* (c)   Cancellation Procedures. To cancel any subscription, Customer must notify us before the start of the next Subscription Term by using the appropriate functionalities of the Service or by contacting us at [AR@seesaw.me](mailto:AR@seesaw.me).  Customer will continue to have access to the subscription through the end of the then-current Subscription Term.  CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT UNLESS AND UNTIL IT NOTIFIES US OF ITS INTENT TO CANCEL, ITS SUBSCRIPTION AND THE CORRESPONDING SUBSCRIPTION FEE WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, AND CUSTOMER AUTHORIZES EACH OF SEESAW AND PAYMENT PROCESSOR (WITHOUT NOTICE TO CUSTOMER, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO CHARGE CUSTOMER THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY APPLICABLE TAXES, USING ANY OF ITS PAYMENT METHODS.
* (d)   Cancellation; Refunds. Customer may de-activate its User Account or any subscription at any time, in its sole discretion, and we may, subject to Section 3.1 (Billing Policies; Taxes), suspend or terminate Customer’s subscription, its User Account, or the Service at any time, in our sole discretion.  HOWEVER, CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IT WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ANY REFUND OR CREDIT FOR ANY SUCH CANCELLATION, SUSPENSION, OR TERMINATION, NOR FOR ANY UNUSED TIME ON ITS SUBSCRIPTION, ANY PRE-PAYMENTS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH ITS SUBSCRIPTION, ANY LICENSE OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, ANY CONTENT OR DATA ASSOCIATED WITH ITS USER ACCOUNT, OR ANYTHING ELSE, AND THAT ANY SUCH REFUNDS OR CREDITS MAY BE GRANTED AT OUR SOLE OPTION AND IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION.  If Customer believes it has been improperly charged and would like to request a refund, please contact us at [AR@seesaw.me](mailto:AR@seesaw.me).

3.5 Free Trials. We may, at our sole option and in our sole discretion, offer free trials to a particular paid or premium portion of the Services, subject to the terms of the offer. If Customer is signed up to such a free trial, the relevant paid or premium functionalities of the Services will expire and no longer be available to Customer or its Authorized Users as of the day that follows the last day of its free trial. Customer may not receive a notice that its free trial has ended If Customer cancels its free trial while it is ongoing, Customer’s, or its Authorized Users’ (as applicable) access to the applicable portion of the Services may be terminated immediately upon such cancellation.

4\. **Term and Termination**

4.1 **Agreement Term**  
For Customers, as further described below, a free subscription continues until terminated, while a paid plan has a term that may expire or be terminated pursuant to the Service Order or subscription plan (collectively, the “Term”). The Agreement remains effective until all Service Orders under the Agreement have expired or been terminated or the Agreement itself terminates. Termination of the Agreement will terminate all Service Orders.

4.2 **Termination for Cause**  
We or Customer may terminate the Agreement on notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after the non-breaching party provides notice of the breach. Customer is responsible for its Authorized Users, including for any breaches of the Agreement caused by its Authorized Users. We may terminate the Agreement immediately on notice to Customer if we reasonably believe that the Services are being used by Customer or its Authorized Users in violation of applicable law. We may terminate the Agreement immediately on notice to Customer if Customer is unable to pay its debts, or becomes insolvent, or is subject to an order or a resolution for its liquidation, administration, winding-up or dissolution (otherwise than for the purposes of a solvent amalgamation or reconstruction), or has an administrative or other receiver, manager, trustee, liquidator, administrator or similar officer appointed over all or any substantial part of its assets, or enters into or proposes any composition or arrangement with its creditors generally, or is subject to any analogous event or proceeding in any applicable jurisdiction.

4.3 **Termination Without Cause**  
Customer may terminate its free plans immediately without cause. We may also terminate the Agreement without cause, but we will provide Customer with thirty (30) days prior written notice.

4.4 **Effect of Termination**  
Upon any termination for cause by Customer, we will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Term for Services not performed, after the effective date of termination. Upon any termination for cause by us, Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Term after the effective date of termination. In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Upon expiration of a paid portion of the Service, Customer will have access to a free version of the Service and these Terms shall continue to govern all use of the Service by Customer or its Authorized Users. If Customer wishes to fully cancel its status as a Customer under the Agreement, it must affirmatively notify Seesaw in writing of its intent to do so and Customer will immediately cease use, and ensure its Authorized Users immediately cease use, of all User Accounts under Customer’s control.

5\. **Copyright Policy**  
We respect artists and content owner rights, and it is our policy to respond to alleged infringement notices that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (as it may be amended, “**DMCA**“). If you believe that any content available via the Services may violate your copyright, please see our [Copyright & Intellectual Property Policy](https://web.seesaw.me/dmca), which is incorporated into these Terms, for instructions on sending us a notice of copyright infringement. It is the policy of Seesaw to terminate the user accounts of repeat infringers.

6\. **Privacy; Data Security**

6.1 **Privacy**. We care about your privacy. For information about how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information and aggregated and/or anonymized data, please refer to our Privacy Notice. For Seesaw Customers who are schools, districts or educational institutions, our obligations with respect to processing personal data of Authorized Users may be governed by a data processing agreement or other contractual terms between Seesaw and the Customer. For Customers in the EU, UK, and Switzerland, Seesaw’s standard Data Processing Agreement (EU, UK, Switzerland) set out at \[[link](https://seesaw.com/data-processing-agreement/)\] applies and is incorporated into these Terms, unless otherwise agreed in writing between Seesaw and the applicable education Customer in those jurisdictions. For Customers in the U.S., you can see a number of the Data Privacy Agreements Seesaw has signed by state by clicking [here](https://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us/articles/4403250029325-Data-Privacy-Agreements-by-State). If we have not yet signed a Data Privacy Agreement with a district in a Customer’s state, Customer must contact Seesaw to execute a new Data Privacy Agreement.

6.2 **Security**. We care about the integrity and security of your personal information. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or to use your data for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your data at your own risk.

6.3 **Deletion**. We reserve the right to delete any User Content at any time after termination of Customer’s status as a Customer, or at any time during the Term after any prolonged period of inactivity of the relevant User Account which may reasonably suggest that the account has been abandoned.

6.4. **Notice of Electronic Access.** In accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 3319.327 and Minnesota Statute section 13.32 subdivision 14, Seesaw hereby provides notice that the Seesaw services electronically access or monitor the audio or visual receiving, transmitting, or recording feature of a school-issued devices. Please note that the use of these features is strictly limited to educational purposes, and access is only initiated under the supervision or consent of the teacher.

7\. **Additional Terms for U.S. Education Professional Customers**

7.1 **State or Local Government Customers**

If Customer is a state or local government, the terms in this Section apply, but only to the extent the Services are being used in Customer or its Authorized User’s official capacity as a state or local government official. The Sections in the contract titled “Governing Law; “Venue”; Class Action / Waiver of Jury Trial / Fees,” and “Indemnification” will not apply to Customer only to the extent Customer’s jurisdiction’s laws prohibit Customer from accepting the requirements in those sections.

7.2 **U.S. Education Professional Customers**

If Customer is a school or educator in the United States who uses Seesaw for an educational purpose, the terms in this Section apply. Individually and collectively, Seesaw and Customer agree to uphold our obligations under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“**FERPA**“), the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“**COPPA**“), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (“**PPRA**“), applicable state laws relating to student data privacy, and all other laws and regulations governing the protection of Student Data. “**Student Data**” is any information that is directly related to an identifiable current or former student that is maintained by a school, school district, or related entity or organization, or by us, in connection with the provision of the Services, and may include “educational records” as defined by FERPA. Under FERPA, Seesaw processes Student Data as a school official with a legitimate interest, subject to the Customer’s direction and control. For the avoidance of doubt, Seesaw’s processing of Student Data on behalf of Customer is governed by the terms of the contractual agreement between Seesaw and the educational institution Customer, including, as applicable, a Data Privacy Agreement. As between Seesaw and Customer, Customer owns all right, title, and interest to all Student Data, and we do not own, control, or license Student Data, except so as to provide the Service to Customer and its Authorized Users.

By using Seesaw in an educational setting, Customer authorizes Seesaw to access, collect, transmit, modify, display and store Student Data to provide the Service and as otherwise described in these Terms, our Privacy Notice and other applicable agreement between Seesaw and the Customer. If Customer permits Students under the age of 13 to use the Service, Customer represents and warrants that it has the requisite authority to provide consent for Seesaw to collect personal information from Students under 13, as permitted by COPPA, for the purposes of providing the Services. Where required, Customer represents it has provided the necessary disclosures to Authorized Users (and to their parents/guardians, as applicable) regarding Seesaw’s processing of Student Data. Seesaw recommends that all teacher and educator Customers provide a copy of our Privacy Notice to parents and guardians.

8\. **Representations; Disclaimer of Warranties**

You represent and warrant that you have validly entered into the Agreement and have the legal power to do so. Customer further represents and warrants that it is responsible for the conduct of its Authorized Users and their compliance with the terms of the Agreement.

You agree that the Services will be deemed solely based in the State of California. If you are located in the United States, you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Services or the Agreement for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration Agreement below is found to be unenforceable, and each party consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. If you are located outside the United States, for any dispute arising out of or relating to the use of the Services or the Agreement, you may make a claim in a competent court in the country in which you reside. To the maximum extent permitted by law, these Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law governing these Terms, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, “**FAA**“) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration provision below and preempts all state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration provision, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of the U.S. state where you live (if applicable) or the jurisdiction mutually agreed upon in writing by you and us. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

12.2 **Arbitration**

_**This Arbitration Agreement applies to Customers who are located in the United States. Read this Section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you may seek relief from us.**_

* (a)   General. For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at legal@seesaw.me and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If we have not been able to resolve a dispute within sixty (60) days of your first contact, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California unless we agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (a) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (b) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (c) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.

12.3 **Class Action / Waiver of Jury Trial / Fees**

**_This waiver applies to Customers who are located in the United States: To the maximum extent permitted by law_, with respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Services for personal, commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You and Seesaw agree that the arbitrator may award relief only to an individual claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief on your individual claim(s). Any relief awarded may not affect other users. You and Seesaw further agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Seesaw are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to bring, join, or participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind as a plaintiff or class member.** In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney’s fees.
