**V.        PRIVACY PRINCIPLES**
--------------------------------

_**Principle 1 - Accountability**_

**The TekSavvy Companies are responsible for all personal information under their control and shall designate one or more persons who are accountable for compliance with the following principles.**

  
1.1    Responsibility for ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Privacy Policy rests with the senior management of the TekSavvy Companies, which shall designate one or more persons to be accountable for compliance with the Privacy Policy. Other individuals within TekSavvy Companies may be delegated to act on behalf of the designated person(s) or to take responsibility for the day-to-day collection and processing of personal information.

  
1.2    The TekSavvy Companies shall make known, upon request, the title of the person or persons designated to oversee the TekSavvy Companies' compliance with the Privacy Policy.

  
The TekSavvy Companies have designated the Data Protection Office to oversee compliance with the Privacy Policy. The Data Protection Office can be contacted at:

  
Data Protection Office   
TekSavvy Solutions Inc  
800 Richmond Street  
Chatham, Ontario N7M 5J5  
Fax: 1.519.360.1716  
Email: privacy@teksavvy.ca

  
1.3    The TekSavvy Companies are responsible for all personal information in their possession or control, including information that has been transferred to a third party for processing. The TekSavvy Companies shall use appropriate means to provide a comparable level of protection while information is being processed by a third party (see Principle 7).

  
1.4    The TekSavvy Companies have implemented policies and procedures to give effect to the Privacy Policy, including:

                 a)      implementing procedures to protect personal information and to oversee the TekSavvy Companies' compliance with the Privacy Policy;

                 b)      establishing procedures to receive and respond to inquiries or complaints;

                 c)      training and communicating to staff about the TekSavvy Companies' policies and practices; and

                 d)      developing public information to explain the TekSavvy Companies' policies and practices.

  
_**Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes for Collection of Personal Information**_

**The TekSavvy Companies shall identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected.**

  
2.1    The TekSavvy Companies shall collect personal information only for the following purposes:

                 a)      To establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with customers and to provide ongoing service;

                 b)      To understand customer needs;

                 c)      To develop, enhance, market or provide products and services;  
                 d)      To manage and develop their business and operations, including personnel and employment matters; and

                 e)      To meet legal and regulatory requirements.

  
Further references to "identified purposes" mean the purposes identified in this Principle 2.1.

  
2.2    The TekSavvy Companies shall specify orally, electronically or in writing the identified purposes to the customer or employee at or before the time personal information is collected. Upon request, persons collecting personal information shall explain these identified purposes or refer the individual to a designated person within the TekSavvy Companies who shall explain the purposes.

2.3    Unless required by law, the TekSavvy Companies shall not use or disclose, for any new purpose, personal information that has been collected without first identifying and documenting the new purpose and obtaining the consent of the customer or employee.

  
2.4    As members of the public browse the website teksavvy.com or other websites of the TekSavvy Companies (“Sites”), advertising cookies will be placed on the users’ computers so that the TekSavvy Companies can understand consumer interests.  “Cookies” are small information packets that a website creates which are stored on the hard drive of a user’s computer by the user’s browser software. The TekSavvy Companies use cookies to track and collect information relating to use of the Sites by the public. The display-advertising partner, AdRoll, then enables the TekSavvy Companies to present users of the Sites with retargeted advertising on other sites based on the users’ previous interaction with the Sites. The techniques employed by AdRoll and their advertising partners do not collect personal information such as user names, email addresses, postal addresses or telephone numbers.  Members of the public can visit this [page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) to opt out of AdRoll and their partners’ targeted advertising.

  
_**Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure of Personal Information**_

**The knowledge and consent of a customer or employee is required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.**

  
3.1    In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge or consent of the individual. For example, the TekSavvy Companies may collect or use personal information without knowledge or consent if it is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as when the individual is a minor, seriously ill or mentally incapacitated.

  
The TekSavvy Companies may also collect, use or disclose personal information without knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law.

  
The TekSavvy Companies may also use or disclose personal information without knowledge or consent in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened.

  
The TekSavvy Companies may disclose personal information without knowledge or consent to a lawyer representing the TekSavvy Companies, to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as may be otherwise required by law.

  
3.2    In obtaining consent, the TekSavvy Companies shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that a customer or employee is advised of the identified purposes for which personal information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the customer or employee.

  
3.3    Generally, the TekSavvy Companies shall seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the same time they collect the information. However, the TekSavvy Companies may seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.

3.4    The TekSavvy Companies will require customers to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as a condition of the supply of a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure is required to fulfill the identified purposes.

·         For example, TekSavvy may collect customers’ IP address, MAC address, and router settings from routers connected to TekSavvy’s network for the purpose of providing ongoing service. TekSavvy uses this data to routinely monitor and manage end-users’ connectivity and performance on TekSavvy’s network.

3.5    In determining the appropriate form of consent, the TekSavvy Companies shall take into account the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of their customers and employees.

3.6    In general, the use of products and services by a customer, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an employee, constitutes implied consent for the TekSavvy Companies to collect, use and disclose personal information for all identified purposes.

  
3.7    A customer or employee may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Customers and employees may contact the TekSavvy Companies for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.

  
_**Principle 4 - Limiting Collection of Personal Information**_

**The TekSavvy Companies shall limit the collection of personal information to that which is necessary for the purposes identified. The TekSavvy Companies shall collect personal information by fair and lawful means.**

4.1    The TekSavvy Companies collect personal information primarily from their customers or employees.

  
4.2    The TekSavvy Companies may also collect personal information from other sources including credit bureaus, employers or personal references, or other third parties that represent that they have the right to disclose the information.

  
_**Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information**_

  
**The TekSavvy Companies shall not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law. The TekSavvy Companies shall retain personal information only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.**

5.1    We do not share personal information with anyone outside the TekSavvy Companies where we can avoid it, however circumstances when we have to do so.

·         **We limit how much information we disclose to third parties:** With respect to third party requests for information, where we are required to disclose personal information we limit it to the information required in the circumstances, provide it only for the purpose stipulated, and make it subject to strict terms of confidentiality. When a court orders us to provide personal information, we tell you about it unless we have been ordered by law not to, and we follow up regularly to question whether non-disclosure orders ought to remain in force.

·         **We work to keep as much traffic within Canada as we can:** With respect to Internet traffic, we place an emphasis on preferring in-country interconnection for domestic traffic. We peer openly with peers in Canada whose Autonomous Systems are mostly located within Canada and who provide geographically diverse peering within Canada. We peer conditionally with other peers. We maintain publicly-available information on our traffic routing at [PeeringDB (AS5645)](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/1396).

5.2    In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. (See Principle 3.1)

  
5.3    In addition, the TekSavvy Companies may disclose a customer's personal information to:

                 a)      another telecommunications services provider for the efficient and effective provision of telecommunications services;

                 b)      an entity involved in supplying the customer with communications or communications directory related services;

                 c)      another entity for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of any of the products or services of the TekSavvy Companies;

                 d)      an agent retained by the TekSavvy Companies in connection with the collection of the customer's account;

                 e)      credit grantors and reporting agencies;

                 f)       a person who, in the reasonable judgment of the TekSavvy Companies, is seeking the information as an agent of the customer; and

                 g)      a third party or parties, where the customer consents to such disclosure or disclosure is required by law.

  
5.4    The TekSavvy Companies may disclose personal information about their employees:

                 a)      for normal personnel and benefits administration;

                 b)      in the context of providing references regarding current or former employees in response to requests from prospective employers, to the extent that such references are granted at all; or

                 c)      where disclosure is required by law.

5.5    Only those employees of the TekSavvy Companies who require access for business reasons, or whose duties reasonably so require, are granted access to personal information about customers and employees.

5.6    The TekSavvy Companies shall keep personal information only as long as it remains necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or as required by law. Depending on the circumstances, where personal information has been used to make a decision about a customer or employee, the TekSavvy Companies shall retain, for a period of time that is reasonably sufficient to allow for access by the customer or employee, either the actual information or the rationale for making the decision.

  
5.7    The TekSavvy Companies shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to personal information that is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or required by law to be retained. Such information shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.

  
_**Principle 6 - Accuracy of Personal Information**_

I Love Teksavvy! Great customer service, rarely have any issues with my internet and more than fair pricing. I've been a customer for more than 20 yrs. I wish they offered cell phone service I'd be a faithful customer for sure.
