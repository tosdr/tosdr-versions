However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.

We will ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed except insofar as you have consented to such disclosure or we are required to do so by law.  
We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

* If TASC Software Solutions Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.

You may choose to give your consent to us disclosing your personal data and to receiving promotional or marketing information from other third parties selected by TASC Software Solutions Limited by ticking the relevant boxes at the points where our site collect personal data. Leaving the relevant boxes unchecked indicates to us that you would prefer your personal data not to be disclosed and that you would prefer not to receive such material.  
We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day).  
We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in \[postcode\]). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
