You understand and agree that We are not obligated to use, display, reproduce, or distribute any such ideas, know-how, concepts, or techniques contained in the Feedback, and You have no right to compel such use, display, reproduction, or distribution.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER
-------------------------------------------------------

**Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.**

This Provision allows us to promptly and efficiently resolve any dispute (e.g., claim or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort – including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence – or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision) that may arise between You and Us. Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to You (such as Our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever You also assert claims against Us in the same proceeding.

This Provision provides that all disputes between You and Us shall be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of Your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). You may, however, opt-out of this Provision which means You would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). EVERYONE AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.

Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution

A party who intends to seek arbitration or pursue a claim in court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Us should be sent by email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.gene.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). The Notice must include (1)Your name, address, and email address; (2) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute including any relevant facts regarding your use of the Materials, Services, and/or Website; (3) an explanation of the specific relief sought, including the total damages You seek, if any, and the basis for the damage calculations; (4) Your personally signed statement verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice; and (5) if You have retained an attorney, Your signed statement authorizing Us to disclose personal information about You to Your attorney if necessary in resolving Your claim. The Notice must also be individualized, meaning it can only concern Your dispute and no other person’s dispute. You also agree that, after sending the Notice, at Our request you will personally participate in a discussion by telephone with Us to facilitate resolving your claim before arbitration is initiated. We also agree to participate in a telephone discussion at your request. If We and You do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, You or We may commence an arbitration proceeding or you may pursue Your dispute in court only under the circumstances described below. If either You or We send the other an incomplete Notice, the 60-day period begins only after a complete Notice is received, and if either You or We request a telephone discussion, the 60-day period begins only after the discussion has happened. Compliance with these pre-arbitration Notice and dispute resolution procedures are a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. You may pursue Your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.

Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out

Notwithstanding the above, You or We may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt-out of this Provision by emailing Us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.gene.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) the following information: (1) Your name; (2) Your address; (3) A clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Us through arbitration. The opt-out email must also be individualized, meaning it can only concern Your rights and no other person’s rights. We promise that Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will not negatively affect Your relationship with Us. But, We do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline, so keep in mind that any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your dispute in arbitration or small claims court.

Arbitration Procedures

If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either You or We may initiate arbitration proceedings. National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), [www.namadr.com](https://www.gene.com/www.namadr.com), will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. Any dispute shall be arbitrated on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and You and we Agree not to bring any claims as part of a class action or to bring any claims on behalf of or purporting to represent more than one claimant. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision. You and we agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a signed certification to NAM that they have complied with the pre-arbitration Notice and dispute resolution procedures, before initiating arbitration.

Any arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable NAM rules, including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolutions Rules and Procedures, as applicable. The NAM rules and additional information about NAMS are available at [www.namadr.com](https://www.gene.com/www.namadr.com). This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.

An administrative conference with NAM shall be conducted in each arbitration proceeding, and You and a Genentech representative shall appear at the administrative conference via telephone. If You initiated the arbitration and You fail to appear at the administrative conference, regardless of whether Your counsel attends, NAM will administratively close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless You show good cause as to why You were not able to attend the conference. If We initiated the arbitration and a Genentech representative fails to appear at the administrative conference, regardless of whether our counsel attends, NAM will administratively close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless We show good cause as to why the representative was not able to attend the conference.

Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.

_Arbitration Award_ – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

_Location of Arbitration_ – You or We may initiate arbitration in either New York or the federal judicial district that includes Your billing address. In the event that You select the latter, We may transfer the arbitration to New York so long as We agree to pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator determines You incur as a result of the transfer. You and a Genentech representative will be required to attend the arbitration hearing.

_Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs_ – Responsibility for the payment of arbitration fees (including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the NAM rules unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law, in which case you agree to provide us the option of paying the arbitrator before seeking to initiate any other form of dispute resolution, including litigation. Each Party shall be responsible for its own attorney fees and costs incurred in such arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or determines that the substance of the claim, defense, or relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in which case the arbitrator may order You or Us to pay the other side’s attorney fees or costs.

Class Action Waiver

**You and We agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Party may bring claims (whether in court or arbitration) only in an individual capacity, and agree not to participate in any claim against the other as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding.**

Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both You and We specifically agree to allow such claims or proceedings following initiation of the arbitration.

Jury Waiver

You understand and agree that by accepting this Provision in these Terms, You and We are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, You and We might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others. Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that You would have if You went to court (e.g.,, the rights to both appeal and certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.

Mass Filing and Batching Process

For purposes of efficient administration, in the event twenty-five (25) or more substantially similar demands for arbitration are filed by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organization (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree that (1) NAM (or another arbitration provider selected by the parties or by the court if NAM is unavailable), shall administer the Mass Filing in batches of 25 per batch (if, after batching, fewer than 25 demands remain, then the final batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) a single, different arbitrator shall be designated for each batch (unless the parties agree otherwise) selected in accordance with the applicable NAM rules; (iii) no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 25 is filed, processed, and adjudicated, (iv) any arbitration fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing shall only be assessed after the demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 25 demands, shall continue until each demand (including Your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved.

You agree to cooperate in good faith with Us and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether the batch arbitration procedure applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. The batch arbitration procedure set forth herein shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing class arbitration of any kind. We reserve our right to raise unique defenses as to each claimant in connection with this process, and You reserve all rights to raise unique claims, facts, and defenses in connection with Your claims. While NAM shall batch the claims for organizational purposes, it shall not consolidate them for decision on the merits and shall decide each case on the merits individually. If Your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, Your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.

Severability

If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver and Mass Filing and Batching Process clauses above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will not apply, but all enforceable provisions will remain valid. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court. If the Mass Filing and Batching Process clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the Class Action Waiver will still apply, but the rest of this Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.

Continuation

This Provision shall survive the termination of Your account with Us or Our affiliates and Your discontinued use of this Website.

GENERAL
-------

We think direct communication resolves most issues – if We feel that You are not complying with these Terms, We will tell You. We will even provide You with recommended necessary corrective action(s) because We value this relationship.

However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by Us, may require immediate termination of Your access to this Website without prior notice to You. The Federal Arbitration Act, California state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms. Foreign laws do not apply. Except for disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or this Website will be heard in the courts located in San Francisco County, California. If any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. By choosing not to enforced any of these Terms, We are not waiving Our rights. These Terms are the entire agreement between You and Us and, therefore, supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between Everyone about this Website. The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by You, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.
