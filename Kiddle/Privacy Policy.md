Kiddle is committed to protecting your privacy while providing you with quality search experience. **We do not collect any personally identifiable information and do not require any registration to use our search service.** Some aggregate data (number of visits and page views) may be used from server logs to evaluate the aggregate site statistics and performance. Our server logs are deleted every 24 hours.

[We use cookies to personalise content and ads](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/), and to analyse our traffic. We also share information about your use of our site with our advertising and analytics partners who may combine it with other information you've provided to them or they've collected from your use of their services. If you wish to opt out of Google cookies you may do so by visiting the [Google privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) page.

Third party sites appearing in search results are not operated by Kiddle and have their own privacy policies. All sites appearing on Kiddle satisfy family friendly requirements, as we filter sites with explicit or deceptive content.

Should this privacy policy change in the future, the changes will be posted on this page.
