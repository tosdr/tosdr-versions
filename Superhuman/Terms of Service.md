These Terms of Service are effective as of the date you and Superhuman enter into an online order or you otherwise complete the online ordering flow on the Service (the “**_Effective Date_**”). If you are accepting these Terms of Service on behalf of your employer, organization or another entity (collectively, an “**_Entity_**”) (which will be deemed to the case if you sign up for a Service using an email address from such Entity), then you represent and warrant that (a) you have read and understand these Terms of Service, (b) you have full legal authority to bind such Entity to these Terms of Service and (c) you agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of such Entity. As used in the remainder of these Terms of Service, “**_You_**” means the Entity you represent in accepting these Terms of Service or, if that does not apply, you individually.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. We will also notify you, either through the Services user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, provided that if you have paid for a subscription to a Service (“**_Subscription_**”), then with respect to that Service any such change will take effect at the next renewal of your Subscription, except as set forth below. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.

**_PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) THAT YOU SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION, AND FURTHER (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST SUPERHUMAN ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, (2) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO SEEK RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND (3) YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US RESOLVED BY A JURY OR IN A COURT OF LAW._**

ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU OR BE ENFORCEABLE WITH RESPECT TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.

IF YOU ARE A USER FROM NEW JERSEY, THE FOREGOING SECTIONS TITLED “INDEMNITY”, "DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES" AND "LIMITATION OF LIABILITY" ARE INTENDED TO BE ONLY AS BROAD AS IS PERMITTED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. IF ANY PORTION OF THESE SECTIONS IS HELD TO BE INVALID UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, THE INVALIDITY OF SUCH PORTION SHALL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THE APPLICABLE SECTIONS.

**Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

**a. Agreement to Arbitrate**

This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Superhuman, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Superhuman are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

**b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief**

**_YOU AND SUPERHUMAN AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SUPERHUMAN AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION._**

**c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution**

Superhuman is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at [hello@superhuman.com](mailto:hello@superhuman.com). If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("**_Notice_**"). The Notice to Superhuman should be sent to the address listed on our [Contact page](https://superhuman.com/contact) ("**_Notice Address_**"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Superhuman and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Superhuman may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Superhuman or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Superhuman is entitled.

**d. Arbitration Procedures**

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("**_AAA_**") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the "**_AAA Rules_**"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, [https://www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, [https://go.adr.org/consumer-arbitration](https://go.adr.org/consumer-arbitration). If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

Unless Superhuman and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Superhuman agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

**e. Costs of Arbitration**

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “**_Arbitration Fees_**”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either Company or you under the AAA Rules, Company and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, Company will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

**f. Confidentiality of Arbitration**

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

**g. Severability**

If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.

**h. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement**

Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Superhuman agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Superhuman written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).

**Termination**

You agree that Superhuman, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Superhuman believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service, provided that if you have a Subscription to a Service, subject to the Subscription non-renewal provisions above, Superhuman may terminate your Subscription only if you commit a material breach of any terms or conditions of these Terms of Service and fail to remedy such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.

In addition to the Subscription non-renewal provisions above, you may terminate a Subscription if Superhumans commit a material breach of any terms or conditions of these Terms of Service with respect to such Subscription and fails to remedy such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach.

Upon non-renewal or termination of your account or any Subscription, any terms or conditions that by their nature should survive such termination will survive, including the terms and conditions relating to payment, proprietary rights and confidentiality, Service restrictions, disclaimers, indemnification, limitations of liability, termination, the Arbitration Agreement, and the general provisions below.

**Modifications to these Terms of Service**

Superhuman may modify these Terms of Service as set forth above. Notwithstanding anything herein, in some cases (e.g., changes addressing new functions of the Services or changes made for legal reasons) we may specify that such modifications become effective immediately or on a set date. If you object to those modifications and have paid for a Subscription, and the effective modification date is during your then-current Subscription, then (as your exclusive remedy) you may terminate your then-current Subscription upon notice to us, and we will refund you any fees you have pre-paid for use of the affected Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription term. To exercise this right, you must provide us with notice of your objection and termination within thirty (30) days of us providing notice of the modifications.

**User Disputes**

You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service and Superhuman will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Superhuman reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.

**General**

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Superhuman and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Superhuman with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Superhuman agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. The failure of Superhuman to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Superhuman. As an exception to the foregoing, you may assign these Terms of Service in their entirety to your successor resulting from a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of your assets; provided that you provide Superhuman with prompt written notice of the assignment and the assignee agrees in writing to assume all of your obligations under these terms. Superhuman may assign, sublicense, or transfer any or all of its rights and obligations under this Terms of Service without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
