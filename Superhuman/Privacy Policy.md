Privacy Policy

Last Updated: June 26, 2024

Welcome to Superhuman, a service provided by Superhuman Labs, Inc. ("**Superhuman**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**"). Superhuman provides the fastest email experience in the world, designed to make our users twice as productive.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, disclose, and otherwise process personal data when you use our website (the "**Site**"), mobile application (the "**App**"), and all related services provided by Superhuman (collectively, the "**Service**"), and your choices concerning our data practices.

"**You**" or "**your**", as used in this Privacy Policy, refers to the individual to whom personal data relates.

**Personal Data We Process on Behalf of Business Customers:** If one of our business customers (such as your employer) provides you with access to the Service, there are a few points to keep in mind when you review this Privacy Policy:

* Our business customers may impose certain restrictions on how we may process their users' personal data – for example, by limiting our marketing to that customer's users. Our Privacy Policy does not reflect these restrictions; they are governed by our Terms of Service and other agreements with the applicable business customer.
* If you are a business user, you should contact the business customer directly to access, correct or request deletion of your personal data. If you contact Superhuman with a privacy request, we will refer your request to the business customer that provides you with access to the Service, and we will assist that business customer in responding to your request.

**Information About Non-Users**. If you exchange emails with other individuals who are not using our Service (“Non-Users”), we will process information about such Non-Users to provide the Service to you as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not use Email Content Data (as defined below) or other information we receive about Non-Users from you to advertise or market to those Non-Users. We collect the email addresses of Non-Users only to provide the Service.

Please [contact us](mailto:privacy@superhuman.com) if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy.

**1\. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT**

**Personal Data You Provide**

We may also collect employment-related information if you are a representative of one of our business customers.
* **Your payment information**, when you enroll in one of our plans or otherwise make a purchase on the Service. This information is processed by our payment service provider, Stripe, which may handle your payment information in accordance with its own privacy policy ([https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy)). We do not have access to your full payment card information.

**5\. USE OF THIRD-PARTY AI TECHNOLOGY**

We leverage third-party AI technology, offered by our service providers, to enable Superhuman's AI features. These features are designed to assist you in communicating through the Services, including by helping you search, draft, summarize, and edit emails. To enable these features, we will disclose some of your information to our AI service providers.

We allow our AI service providers to use your information for the purpose of providing our Service – for example to generate email drafts for you – and we do not allow those providers to train their AI models using your data.

**6\. DATA RETENTION**

We keep personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, in accordance with our retention policies, applicable laws, and regulatory obligations, or until you withdraw your consent (where applicable).

To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we use your personal data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

**7\. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Our Service is not directed to children who are under the age of 16. Superhuman does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16.

**8\. DATA TRANSFERS**

You will provide personal data directly to our website in the United States. We may also transfer personal data to our partners and service providers in the United States and other jurisdictions. Please note that such jurisdictions may not provide the same protections as the data protection laws in your home country.

When we engage in cross-border data transfers, we will ensure that relevant safeguards are in place to afford adequate protection for personal data and we will comply with applicable data protection laws, in particular by relying on an EU Commission or UK government adequacy decision or on contractual protections for the transfer of personal data.

**COOKIE POLICY**

This Cookie Policy explains how Superhuman uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with our Service.

If you have any questions or concerns about the Cookie Policy, please contact us at [privacy@superhuman.com](mailto:privacy@superhuman.com) or as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy.

**What are cookies and similar technologies?**

* **Cookies** are text files that websites store on a visitor's device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand activity, and patterns and facilitating online advertising.
* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked. There are various types of web beacons or pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a service that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser, or collect other information about your visit.

This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as “cookies.”

**How do we use cookies and other similar technologies?**

We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location. The cookies placed through your use of our website are either set by us (first-party cookies) or by a third party at our request (third-party cookies).

We also allow our advertising partners to collect this information through our Site.

**What types of cookies do we use**?

We use the following categories of cookies:

* **Essential cookies.** These cookies are required to enable basic website functionality. They cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Service may not work.
* **Marketing cookies**. These cookies are used to deliver advertising that is more relevant to you and your interests. They may also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Advertising networks usually place them with the our permission.We work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.
    
    As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies on our Website and within our emails and advertisements may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you.
    
* **Personalization cookies**. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, a website may provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing data about your current location.
* **Analytics cookies.** We use analytics cookies that allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. The collected data provides us only with anonymous traffic statistics (like number of page views, number of visitors, and time spent on each page). Examples of the third-party analytics cookies we use include Google Analytics. Specifically, we use Google Analytics to collect information about how users use our services, which we then use to compile reports that disclose trends without identifying individual visitors and help us improve our services. For more information on Google Analytics, click [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12159447?hl=en). For more information about Google's privacy practices, click [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US). You can opt out of Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**How can you control the use of cookies?**

Depending on the location from where you access the Service, you may be presented with a cookie banner or other tool to provide permissions prior to non-Essential cookies being set. In this case, we only set these non-Essential cookies with your consent.

You can also limit online tracking by:

* **Blocking cookies in your browser**. Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based advertising. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.

    * [Google](https://myadcenter.google.com/?sasb=true)

**What are cookies and similar technologies?**

* **Cookies** are text files that websites store on a visitor's device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand activity, and patterns and facilitating online advertising.
* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked. There are various types of web beacons or pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a service that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser, or collect other information about your visit.

This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as “cookies.”

**How do we use cookies and other similar technologies?**

We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location. The cookies placed through your use of our website are either set by us (first-party cookies) or by a third party at our request (third-party cookies).

We also allow our advertising partners to collect this information through our Site.

**What types of cookies do we use**?

We use the following categories of cookies:

* **Essential cookies.** These cookies are required to enable basic website functionality. They cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Service may not work.
* **Marketing cookies**. These cookies are used to deliver advertising that is more relevant to you and your interests.

For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.
    
    As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies on our Website and within our emails and advertisements may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you.
    
* **Personalization cookies**. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, a website may provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing data about your current location.
* **Analytics cookies.** We use analytics cookies that allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. The collected data provides us only with anonymous traffic statistics (like number of page views, number of visitors, and time spent on each page). Examples of the third-party analytics cookies we use include Google Analytics. Specifically, we use Google Analytics to collect information about how users use our services, which we then use to compile reports that disclose trends without identifying individual visitors and help us improve our services.

**Online tracking opt-out**. You can opt out of third-party cookies as described in our Cookie Policy.

**Personal data requests**. We offer you choices that affect how we handle the personal data that we control. Depending on your location and the nature of your interactions with our Service, you may request the following in relation to your personal data:

* **Information** about how we have collected and used personal data. We have made this information available to you without having to request it by including it in this Privacy Policy.

* **Opt out of selling or sharing** your personal data for interest-based advertising**.** We share personal data with advertising partners that display targeted advertisements to users around the web. This may constitute “selling” or “sharing” personal information or “targeted advertising” under applicable laws. You can opt-out of our use or sharing of personal information for these purposes as described in our Cookie Policy, by enabling the Global Privacy Control setting within the browser that you use to access our Service. Learn more at the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) website. Please note that your opt out will be specific to the device and browser you use when you opt out. We do not have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the personal information of children under the age of 16.
* **Additional rights**, such as to **object** to and request that we **restrict** our use of personal data.

To exercise these privacy rights, or if you have any questions about we handle your personal data, please contact us as provided in the [Contact Us](https://superhuman.com/privacy#contact-us) section below. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be entitled to empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on your behalf. We will require authorized agents to confirm their identity and authority, in accordance with applicable laws. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.

**Limits on your privacy rights and choices.** In some instances, your choices may be limited, such as where fulfilling your request would impair the rights of others, our ability to provide a service you have requested, or our ability to comply with our legal obligations and enforce our legal rights. If you are not satisfied with how we address your request, you may submit a complaint by contacting us as provided in the [Contact Us](https://superhuman.com/privacy#contact-us) section below. Depending on where you reside, such as if you reside in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, you may have the right to complain to a data protection regulator where you live or work, or where you feel a violation has occurred. For example, in the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office, can be contacted at [https://ico.org.uk/concerns](https://ico.org.uk/concerns), and, in EU countries, you can contact the data protection authority of the country in which you are located.

**5\. USE OF THIRD-PARTY AI TECHNOLOGY**

We leverage third-party AI technology, offered by our service providers, to enable Superhuman's AI features. These features are designed to assist you in communicating through the Services, including by helping you search, draft, summarize, and edit emails. To enable these features, we will disclose some of your information to our AI service providers.

We allow our AI service providers to use your information for the purpose of providing our Service – for example to generate email drafts for you – and we do not allow those providers to train their AI models using your data.

**6\. DATA RETENTION**

We keep personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, in accordance with our retention policies, applicable laws, and regulatory obligations, or until you withdraw your consent (where applicable).

To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we use your personal data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

**7\. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Our Service is not directed to children who are under the age of 16. Superhuman does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal data to Superhuman through the Service please [contact us](https://superhuman.com/privacy#contact-us) and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

**8\. DATA TRANSFERS**

You will provide personal data directly to our website in the United States. We may also transfer personal data to our partners and service providers in the United States and other jurisdictions. Please note that such jurisdictions may not provide the same protections as the data protection laws in your home country.

When we engage in cross-border data transfers, we will ensure that relevant safeguards are in place to afford adequate protection for personal data and we will comply with applicable data protection laws, in particular by relying on an EU Commission or UK government adequacy decision or on contractual protections for the transfer of personal data.

We have further committed to refer unresolved Data Privacy Framework complaints to an alternative dispute resolution provider.

This Cookie Policy explains how Superhuman uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with our Service.

If you have any questions or concerns about the Cookie Policy, please contact us at [privacy@superhuman.com](mailto:privacy@superhuman.com) or as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy.

**What are cookies and similar technologies?**

* **Cookies** are text files that websites store on a visitor's device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand activity, and patterns and facilitating online advertising.
* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked. There are various types of web beacons or pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a service that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser, or collect other information about your visit.

This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as “cookies.”

**How do we use cookies and other similar technologies?**

We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location. The cookies placed through your use of our website are either set by us (first-party cookies) or by a third party at our request (third-party cookies).

We also allow our advertising partners to collect this information through our Site.

**What types of cookies do we use**?

We use the following categories of cookies:

* **Essential cookies.** These cookies are required to enable basic website functionality. They cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Service may not work.
* **Marketing cookies**. These cookies are used to deliver advertising that is more relevant to you and your interests. They may also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Advertising networks usually place them with the our permission.We work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.
    
    As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies on our Website and within our emails and advertisements may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you.
    
* **Personalization cookies**. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, a website may provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing data about your current location.
* **Analytics cookies.** We use analytics cookies that allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. The collected data provides us only with anonymous traffic statistics (like number of page views, number of visitors, and time spent on each page). Examples of the third-party analytics cookies we use include Google Analytics. Specifically, we use Google Analytics to collect information about how users use our services, which we then use to compile reports that disclose trends without identifying individual visitors and help us improve our services. For more information on Google Analytics, click [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12159447?hl=en). For more information about Google's privacy practices, click [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).

**How can you control the use of cookies?**

Depending on the location from where you access the Service, you may be presented with a cookie banner or other tool to provide permissions prior to non-Essential cookies being set. In this case, we only set these non-Essential cookies with your consent.
