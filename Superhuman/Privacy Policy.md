Privacy Policy

Last Updated: October 7, 2024

Welcome to Superhuman, a service provided by Superhuman Labs, Inc. ("**Superhuman**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**"). Superhuman provides the fastest email experience in the world, designed to make our users twice as productive.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, disclose, and otherwise process personal data when you use our website (the "**Site**"), mobile application (the "**App**"), and all related services provided by Superhuman (collectively, the "**Service**"), and your choices concerning our data practices.

"**You**" or "**your**", as used in this Privacy Policy, refers to the individual to whom personal data relates.

**Personal Data We Process on Behalf of Business Customers:** If one of our business customers (such as your employer) provides you with access to the Service, there are a few points to keep in mind when you review this Privacy Policy:

* Our business customers may impose certain restrictions on how we may process their users' personal data – for example, by limiting our marketing to that customer's users. Our Privacy Policy does not reflect these restrictions; they are governed by our Terms of Service and other agreements with the applicable business customer.
* If you are a business user, you should contact the business customer directly to access, correct or request deletion of your personal data. If you contact Superhuman with a privacy request, we will refer your request to the business customer that provides you with access to the Service, and we will assist that business customer in responding to your request.

**Information About Non-Users**. If you exchange emails with other individuals who are not using our Service (“Non-Users”), we will process information about such Non-Users to provide the Service to you as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not use Email Content Data (as defined below) or other information we receive about Non-Users from you to advertise or market to those Non-Users. We collect the email addresses of Non-Users only to provide the Service.

Please [contact us](mailto:privacy@superhuman.com) if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy.

We may also collect employment-related information if you are a representative of one of our business customers.

This information is processed by our payment service provider, Stripe, which may handle your payment information in accordance with its own privacy policy ([https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy)).

This Cookie Policy explains how Superhuman uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with our Service.

If you have any questions or concerns about the Cookie Policy, please contact us at [privacy@superhuman.com](mailto:privacy@superhuman.com) or as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy.

**What are cookies and similar technologies?**

* **Cookies** are text files that websites store on a visitor's device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand activity, and patterns and facilitating online advertising.
* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked. There are various types of web beacons or pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a service that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser, or collect other information about your visit.

This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as “cookies.”

**How do we use cookies and other similar technologies?**

We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location. The cookies placed through your use of our website are either set by us (first-party cookies) or by a third party at our request (third-party cookies).

We also allow our advertising partners to collect this information through our Site.

**What types of cookies do we use**?

We use the following categories of cookies:

* **Essential cookies.** These cookies are required to enable basic website functionality. They cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Service may not work.
* **Marketing cookies**. These cookies are used to deliver advertising that is more relevant to you and your interests. They may also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Advertising networks usually place them with the our permission.We work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.
    
    As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies on our Website and within our emails and advertisements may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you.
    
* **Personalization cookies**. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, a website may provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing data about your current location.
* **Analytics cookies.** We use analytics cookies that allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. The collected data provides us only with anonymous traffic statistics (like number of page views, number of visitors, and time spent on each page). Examples of the third-party analytics cookies we use include Google Analytics. Specifically, we use Google Analytics to collect information about how users use our services, which we then use to compile reports that disclose trends without identifying individual visitors and help us improve our services. For more information on Google Analytics, click [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12159447?hl=en).

* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked. There are various types of web beacons or pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code).

* **Essential cookies.** These cookies are required to enable basic website functionality. They cannot be switched off in our systems.

For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.
    
    As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies on our Website and within our emails and advertisements may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you.
    
* **Personalization cookies**. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, a website may provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing data about your current location.

This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. The collected data provides us only with anonymous traffic statistics (like number of page views, number of visitors, and time spent on each page). Examples of the third-party analytics cookies we use include Google Analytics. Specifically, we use Google Analytics to collect information about how users use our services, which we then use to compile reports that disclose trends without identifying individual visitors and help us improve our services.

**6\. DATA RETENTION**

We keep personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, in accordance with our retention policies, applicable laws, and regulatory obligations, or until you withdraw your consent (where applicable).

**8\. DATA TRANSFERS**

You will provide personal data directly to our website in the United States. We may also transfer personal data to our partners and service providers in the United States and other jurisdictions. Please note that such jurisdictions may not provide the same protections as the data protection laws in your home country.

When we engage in cross-border data transfers, we will ensure that relevant safeguards are in place to afford adequate protection for personal data and we will comply with applicable data protection laws, in particular by relying on an EU Commission or UK government adequacy decision or on contractual protections for the transfer of personal data.

This Cookie Policy explains how Superhuman uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with our Service.

If you have any questions or concerns about the Cookie Policy, please contact us at [privacy@superhuman.com](mailto:privacy@superhuman.com) or as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy.

**What are cookies and similar technologies?**

* **Cookies** are text files that websites store on a visitor's device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand activity, and patterns and facilitating online advertising.
* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked. There are various types of web beacons or pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a service that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser, or collect other information about your visit.

This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as “cookies.”

**How do we use cookies and other similar technologies?**

We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location. The cookies placed through your use of our website are either set by us (first-party cookies) or by a third party at our request (third-party cookies).

We also allow our advertising partners to collect this information through our Site.

**What types of cookies do we use**?

We use the following categories of cookies:

* **Essential cookies.** These cookies are required to enable basic website functionality. They cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Service may not work.
* **Marketing cookies**. These cookies are used to deliver advertising that is more relevant to you and your interests. They may also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Advertising networks usually place them with the our permission.We work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.
    
    As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies on our Website and within our emails and advertisements may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you.
    
* **Personalization cookies**. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, a website may provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing data about your current location.
* **Analytics cookies.** We use analytics cookies that allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. The collected data provides us only with anonymous traffic statistics (like number of page views, number of visitors, and time spent on each page). Examples of the third-party analytics cookies we use include Google Analytics. Specifically, we use Google Analytics to collect information about how users use our services, which we then use to compile reports that disclose trends without identifying individual visitors and help us improve our services. For more information on Google Analytics, click [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12159447?hl=en). For more information about Google's privacy practices, click [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).
