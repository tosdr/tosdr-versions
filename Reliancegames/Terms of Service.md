    **Submissions**:  
    Reliance Games is pleased to hear from their customers and welcomes their comments regarding our services and the site. Unfortunately, however, long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those it has specifically requested. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by our professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as game ideas or original artwork. While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials. If at our request you send certain specific submissions (e.g., Communications, including, postings and creative submissions) or, despite our request that you not send us any other creative materials, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information (collectively, the "Submissions"), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of Reliance Games. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Reliance Games, and Reliance Games shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, Reliance Games shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature, in perpetuity, throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions. You waive any and all moral rights in any such Submissions as well as any claim to a right of credit or approval.
