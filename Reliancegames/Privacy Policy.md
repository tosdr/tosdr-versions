##### How we use your Personal Data

The information which we collect and store during normal use of the site is used to monitor use of the site and to help its further development. Such use does not always result in any personally identifiable data being collected or stored.  
As mentioned earlier a number of pages in this website has the option for submitting Personal Data and as such all these communications are not confidential. Any application, request or enquiry you make, may be passed or made available to Group affiliates, some of which may be based in countries that do not have data protection laws. All Group affiliates are required to comply with an internal Privacy Policy which requires that steps are taken to protect your Personal Data and for it only to be used for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.  
By submitting your Personal Data through this website, you shall be consenting to it being processed in the manner described above by Group affiliates.  
We use your Personal Data for operational purposes only. For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Site, including any changes to this Privacy Policy. Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. We attempt to limit access to Personal Data about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.  
We may occasionally employ other companies to perform services necessary for our internal operations, such as companies that personalize our web pages, process credit card transactions, analyze customers\\' interaction with our Site, and process consumer surveys. We also provide postal addresses to the Post Office for delivery purposes. While providing their services, these companies may access your Personal Data. These companies have agreed to securely store and maintain the Personal Data received from us.  
Finally, we may take your Personal Data and make it non-personally identifiable. We do this either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information not personally identifiable to you. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. Given the non-personal nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to de-personalize your Personal Data. We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with third parties without your consent.  
We might process your Personal Data for additional purposes that are not mentioned here, but are compatible with the original purpose for which the data was gathered. To do this, we will ensure that:

* the link between purposes, context and nature of Personal Data is suitable for further Processing;
* the further Processing would not harm your interests and
* there would be appropriate safeguard for Processing.

We will inform you of any further Processing and purposes.

##### **When do we disclose your Personal Data?**

We will disclose Personal Data when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law (e.g., court order or subpoena) or such disclosure helps enforce (i) our Terms of Use, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, or game rules; (ii) protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of your property; or (iii) protect the safety and security of our website or third parties.

##### **How do we secure your data?**

The security of your data is important to us and our third party vendors. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number, permanent account number or other details) on our site or an affiliate sign up page, registration or order forms, both we and our third party vendors encrypt that information using secure Socket Layer Technology (SSL).  
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

##### **Note For CALIFORNIA Residents**

If you are a California resident, please be aware that under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (“CCPA”), you are entitled to specific rights regarding your data. Besides other rights outlined in this Policy, California residents have the following rights:

**– The right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.**  
We do not sell your personal information in exchange for money. However, we may disclose a limited amount of your personal information (i) to our advertising partners to enable them to deliver an ad that is relevant to you, or (ii) to our marketing or licensing partners to enable them to send you relevant offers when you have opted in to such communication.

This includes the following categories of your personal information:

identifiers (generally including an advertising ID and your IP address for ad partners and name and email for marketing or licensing partners); and  
internet or other electronic network activity information (including technical information required to select and deliver the appropriate ad type and format).

Because this disclosure of information could be deemed a “sale” in the meaning of the CCPA, we ask for your explicit consent to disclose your personal information to our advertising or marketing partners for the above purposes. You have several options to exercise your right to opt-out:

contact us at support@reliancegames.com  
decline to give consent to such sharing within a Game or a cookie banner on the Websites when you see a message asking for consent; or  
if you initially opted-in for personalized ads within a Game, you may opt-out by going to the settings menu.
