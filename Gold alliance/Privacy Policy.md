To process your request, we may require that you submit the following information in conjunction with your request: your first name, last name, a California address, and email address. The information which you provide will be used to verify your request and to attempt to identify you within our data records. The information which you submit in conjunction with your request to know will be used for the express purposes of verification and providing you with responsive information to your request, if required. Please note that we utilize a two-step process for requests to delete, whereby you first submit your request to delete, and second, you separately confirm that you want your personal information deleted. The CCPA permits requests to know regarding collection and sale or sharing from the same consumer no more than twice in a twelve (12) month period.  

**How an Authorized Agent Can Make a Request Under the CCPA**

If you elect to use an authorized agent to exercise your right to submit a request to know, request to delete, and/or request to correct, before processing the request, we require the purported authorized agent to provide proof of your signed permission to submit the request (unless there is a power of attorney in place pursuant to Probate Code §§ 4121-4130). We also require that you directly verify your own identity with us, and directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf. The information submitted will not be used for any purposes other than to verify the request, fulfill the request, and fraud prevention.

Please note that although Gold Alliance and its representatives are precious metals specialists, we are not licensed or registered investment advisers, attorneys, CPA's, or other financial service professionals. We do not give any tax, financial, legal or investment advice. Additionally, be aware that precious metals, like any investment, carry risk of loss and are not a suitable investment for everyone. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results and precious metals may appreciate, depreciate, or stay the same depending on a variety of factors. Anyone who considers purchasing Precious metals, Gold American Eagles, Proof Gold American Eagles, certified gold coins, as well as gold and silver bars should consider and carefully evaluate the associated risks and acquisition costs before making the investment, and you should always consult your financial and tax professional and carefully evaluate all risks associated with the acquisition of precious metals before making the investment. It is Gold Alliance’s view that precious metals should be considered a long-term investment, and that while you can sell your precious metals at any time, you should be prepared and willing to hold any purchased precious metals for several years before selling them. Gold Alliance cannot guarantee, and makes no representation, that any metals purchased (i.e. .999 gold bars, .9999 silver bars, or any gold or silver coins) will appreciate at all or appreciate sufficiently to produce a profit above and beyond the markup/ commissions charged whether they are bought for direct delivery or inside of a precious metals IRA. The decision to purchase or sell precious metals with funds outside or inside of a Gold IRA or a Gold Backed IRA, and which precious metals to purchase or sell, are the customer’s decision alone, and purchases and sales should be made subject to the customer's own research, prudence, and judgment. By accessing any Gold Alliance content, you agree to be bound by the terms of service. For questions regarding this disclaimer or this website please contact us at 888-567-6689.
