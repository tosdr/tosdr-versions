Please note that although Gold Alliance and its representatives are precious metals specialists, we are not licensed or registered investment advisers, attorneys, CPA's, or other financial service professionals. We do not give any tax, financial, legal or investment advice. Additionally, be aware that precious metals, like any investment, carry risk of loss and are not a suitable investment for everyone. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results and precious metals may appreciate, depreciate, or stay the same depending on a variety of factors. Anyone who considers purchasing Precious metals, Gold American Eagles, Proof Gold American Eagles, certified gold coins, as well as gold and silver bars should consider and carefully evaluate the associated risks and acquisition costs before making the investment, and you should always consult your financial and tax professional and carefully evaluate all risks associated with the acquisition of precious metals before making the investment. It is Gold Alliance’s view that precious metals should be considered a long-term investment, and that while you can sell your precious metals at any time, you should be prepared and willing to hold any purchased precious metals for several years before selling them. Gold Alliance cannot guarantee, and makes no representation, that any metals purchased (i.e. .999 gold bars, .9999 silver bars, or any gold or silver coins) will appreciate at all or appreciate sufficiently to produce a profit above and beyond the markup/ commissions charged whether they are bought for direct delivery or inside of a precious metals IRA. The decision to purchase or sell precious metals with funds outside or inside of a Gold IRA or a Gold Backed IRA, and which precious metals to purchase or sell, are the customer’s decision alone, and purchases and sales should be made subject to the customer's own research, prudence, and judgment. By accessing any Gold Alliance content, you agree to be bound by the terms of service. For questions regarding this disclaimer or this website please contact us at 888-567-6689.
