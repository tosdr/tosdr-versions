Privacy Policy
==============

This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data when you use our Service. We also explain the choices you have in relation to this information. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of your Personal Data. Find out what that means.

1\. What data do we collect and how do we use them?
---------------------------------------------------

We process a few different types of information for different purposes as explained below.  

### Personal Data

(a) In order to provide our Service to you we process:  

* Your name and email address;
* HTTPS requests to our Services, data destinations, and timestamps; however, we do not keep a record of the websites you visit, your IP address, the volume or nature of your network traffic, the content of any communications you make, or the duration of your online sessions.

(b) To manage payments for the Services we process your payment and transaction information (such as the name of the bank which issued the credit card uses for payments, partial credit card information, credit card’s owner’s full name, address, email,  chargebacks requests, cancelled orders and other information requested by legitimate our payment processors).  
  
(c) For security monitoring, performance optimisation, debugging and troubleshooting, fraud detection and other operational intelligence purposes, we may collect and process our server logs containing your IP address, browser type, timestamp, and request URI; however, we cannot associate such data with you personally. This means that the such data is used in a way that doesn't allow us to identify who you are specifically. The information is typically aggregated or anonymized for analysis, so it serves a functional purpose without compromising your personal privacy.  
  
(d) For the purposes of communicating with you and providing support, we process your email and communication information (e.g. content of your emails).  
  
If you consent, we may use your Personal Data to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. In such case we process your email. You may withdraw your consent to receive any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send or by contacting us.  

### Personal Data

You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some aspects of our Service.

--------------------------------------------

If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific purpose for which we process it.

4\. Transfer of data
--------------------

Your personal data will not be sold or otherwise transferred to third parties without a legitimate basis, as well as used for purposes other than those for which they were collected. We will not transfer your personal data in any way other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy or applicable law.  
  
We may transfer your Personal Data to companies that help us operate, i.e. data processors. We require these data processors to process your data only in accordance with our instructions and applicable data protection legislation. We enter into agreements with these data processors that require the parties to comply strictly with the requirements of personal data protection.
