General Terms of Service
========================

These Terms of Service  (“Terms”) is a binding legal agreement between you and UAB “MN Technologijos” (“we”, “us” or “our”) that governs your use of the VPN services (“Services”) and the software (“Software”) provided by us.

1\. Acceptance of terms
-----------------------

By downloading, installing or using the Software and/or accessing or using the Services you are fully accepting the terms, conditions and disclaimers contained in this document and all policies and guidelines that are incorporated by reference. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Terms and agree to be bound by its terms. If you do not agree to the Terms, do not use the Services or the Software.  
  
Our Services may also be subject to the supplementary terms (the “Supplementary Terms”) governing that particular service. If there is a conflict between the Terms and Supplementary Terms, then the Supplementary Terms shall prevail in relation to that particular service.  
  
By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to the Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”). You shall not use the Services in contradiction with these Terms or any applicable law or regulation of the country or territory you originate from or reside in or any applicable jurisdiction (the “Applicable Law”).  
  
You shall not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms and the Applicable Law.  
  
We acknowledge that the laws of certain jurisdictions provide legal rights to consumers that may not be overridden by contract or waived by those consumers. If you are such a consumer, nothing in these Terms limits any of those consumer rights.  

2\. Changed terms
-----------------

We shall have the right at any time to change or modify the Terms or any part thereof. We reserve the right to amend the fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advanced notice posted on this website, application or sent via email. Unless it is stated by us otherwise, such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice published on this website. Any use of the Services after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of such changes, modifications or additions.  

3\. Scope
---------

Subject to (a) your compliance with these Terms and any Applicable Laws and (b) payment of all fees in full, we will permit you to access and use the Services during the Subscription Term (as defined below).   
  
The Services will be made accessible to you via the Software. You must download and install the Software to access and use the Services.  

4\. Subscription
----------------

The Services are provided on a subscription basis for the term and in accordance with the respective subscription plan purchased by you (“Subscription Term” and “Subscription Plan”, respectively, and collectively the “Subscription”).   
  
We offer several Subscription Plans for our Services, which are listed on our website. During the Subscription Term, you can upgrade your Subscription, and we will adjust the fees accordingly on a pro-rata basis.  
  
Upon expiration of the Subscription Term, you will be enrolled into an automatic renewing cycle for the same term and for the same Subscription Plan, unless you cancel your Subscription before the end of the Subscription Term. The same will apply for each renewed Subscription Term.  
  
We may change the offered Subscription Plans, including the fees. Any changes will be communicated to you as per section 2 herein. Your use of the Services after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of such changes.  
  
We may offer a free trial of the Services (“Trial”). During the Trial period the same terms and conditions apply as during the Subscription Term, except as expressly provided in this section 4.5. During the Trial period we will permit you to access and use the Services for free. The duration of the Trial will be specified during the signing up process. Unless you cancel your Subscription before the expiration of the Trial period, you will be enrolled into the Subscription Plan you selected at the time of enrolment and the relevant fees will be charged to you on the day immediately following the end of the Trial period.  

5\. Limited licence
-------------------

Subject to (a) your compliance with these Terms and any Applicable Laws and (b) payment of all fees and charges in full, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use a copy of the Software during the Subscription Term.  
  
You shall not (a) defeat, disable, or circumvent any protection mechanism related to the Software; (b) use the Software or any parts of it to develop a product directly competing with the Software; (c) distribute the Software or derivative works based on the Software.  
  
You shall not remove any product identification, copyright notices or proprietary restrictions from the Software.Nothing contained herein shall be construed, expressly or implicitly, as transferring any right, license or title to you other than those explicitly granted under the Terms. Unauthorized copying of the Software or failure to comply with the restrictions herein will result in automatic termination of these Terms and will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to us for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, in which case injunctive relief will be an appropriate remedy for such breach.  

6\. Your ID and security
------------------------

An ID and a private key (jointly, the “ID Data”) will be automatically created for you when you use the Services for the first time. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your ID Data. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any activities that occur under your ID Data.   
  
You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your ID Data, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by us or another party due to someone else using your account. You may not use anyone else's ID Data at any time, without the permission of the account holder.  

7\. Your Data Protection Rights
-------------------------------

Any fees charged by us are exclusive of taxes. Therefore, we may calculate and add any applicable taxes or fees, including, but not limited to VAT and other taxes and fees under the laws applicable to you. Such taxes and fees will be calculated according to the payment information provided by you to us at the time of purchasing the Services. For this purpose, you must provide us with an accurate information, including the information about your country of residence, and agree to indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising in connection with the inaccurate, false or incomplete information.  
  
By using any payment method, including crypto currency payments, debit or credit card, to purchase the Services, you confirm are the rightful owner of such instrument or that you have permission from the account holder or cardholder to use it. Moreover, it is your responsibility to ensure that your debit or credit card account has sufficient funds to pay for the charges. We shall not be responsible for any additional charges which may be imposed on you by your bank or card issuer.  
  
We reserve the right to block or suspend the Services, if we have reasonable cause to suspect fraudulent use of a payment account, credit or debit card.  

8\. Cancelation and refund
--------------------------

You may cancel the Services at any time by using any self-service mechanisms found within the Services or Software. You may cancel the Services with a full refund within 7 days of your initial Services purchase. Refunds beyond the 7-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole our discretion, if you can demonstrate that the Services were not available or usable during the Subscription Period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact us to resolve the issue. In this case, we may provide you with a pro-rata refund of the fees paid during the period when the Services were not available or usable.  
  
Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or crypto currency paid for the Services.  
  
You can only get a refund for the Services once. If you buy the Services after you have been refunded for the Services, you will not be refunded for any further cancellation. No refunds will be provided if you violate the Terms. Once the refund is provided to you, we will not provide the Services.
