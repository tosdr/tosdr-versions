Cookie Policy
=============

Last updated on April 25, 2022

Rainforest Alliance (“**RA**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”) uses cookies and other technologies on our website to improve and personalize your experience. We do this by remembering your device, your preferences and your visits so that we and our business partners may assist with website navigation, analyze use of our website, and show you relevant content on third party websites through advertising. 

What is a Cookie?
-----------------

A cookie is a small data file stored in your computer, tablet, or smartphone (or any other devices with internet access) when you visit our website. A cookie usually contains the name of the website where the cookie comes from, the duration of the cookie (i.e., how long the cookie will remain on your device), and a value that usually consists of a randomly generated unique number. A cookie is not a program that can contain harmful malware or virus. 

Cookies may be accompanied by the collection of your personal information. [Learn more about how we handle your personal information](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/privacy-policy).

What Do We Use Cookies For?
---------------------------

We use cookies to make our website easier to use and to better tailor our website to your interests and needs. Some cookies perform essential functions for our website. Cookies can also be used to improve the speed of your future activities and sessions on our website. For example, cookies can remember things like whether you have visited our website before; if you are logged in; and the specific language you prefer to see on the website. We also use cookies to target our ads specifically to you on other websites. Finally, we also use cookies to compile anonymous statistics with which we can gain insight into the way people use our websites, so that, for example, the structure and content of our websites can be improved. 

How Long Are Cookies Stored?
----------------------------

The length of time a cookie is stored on your devices varies. “Session cookies” remain on your computer temporarily and expire once you close your browser (or once your session ends). “Persistent cookies” remain on your device until deleted by you or until automatically deleted in accordance with the expiration dates written into their code. The duration of the cookie is calculated according to your last visit to the website. 

What Cookies Are Used?
----------------------

The cookies used on our website fall into four categories: 

* **Strictly necessary**—these cookies help make our website navigable by activating basic functions such as page navigation and access to secure website areas. They cannot be switched off in our systems as they are necessary for the website to function. These cookies do not collect any personally identifiable information. 
* **Functional**—these cookies allow our website to remember your preference and choices you make to provide a more personalized online experience. They can also allow visitors to watch videos, play games, and use social tools such as blogs and forums. These cookies may collect personal information such as your email, username and password, language, region, IP address, and web activity. 
* **Performance**—these cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information. These cookies collect information about web activity. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and anonymous. 
* **Marketing**—these cookies are used to track visitors across websites. They are used to display ads that are relevant and interesting to the visitor and social media platforms. These cookies collect personal information such as your email, username and password, language, region, IP address, and web activity.

Our website uses both “first-party” and “third-party” cookies. First-party cookies are set and collected by our website and are only used by our website when you visit it. Third-party cookies are set and collected on our website by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages (e.g. cookies set by embedded YouTube videos or Facebook advertising). We do not control how third parties use these cookies, so you should check their website to see how they’re using them or block the cookies.

How Can I Manage Or Delete Cookies?
-----------------------------------

You can change your choices regarding which cookies you accept by visiting the “Cookie Settings” function on our website and adjusting the sliders and clicking “Save Settings”. Please note, “strictly necessary” cookies are essential cookies that cannot be turned off using the slider. If you choose not to accept our cookies, then we will only store these “strictly necessary” cookies.

Alternatively, you can manage cookies through your device or browser. Most internet browsers automatically accept cookies unless you change your browser settings. If you wish to restrict, block or delete the cookies which are set by any websites, you can generally do this through your browser settings. The “Help” menu in the toolbar of most web browsers will tell you how to do this, including how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether.

If you block cookies completely, many websites may not work properly and some functionality on our website may not work at all. 

The settings you change only apply to the device on which you change them. If you use different devices to view our website (for example, your computer, smartphone, tablet etc.), you must ensure that each browser on each device is adapted to your cookie preferences.
