How We Share the Information We Collect and Receive
---------------------------------------------------

We may share the personal information we collect or receive from you or about you with third parties to provide products and services you have requested, when we have your consent, or as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We may share information with:

* **Affiliates**. The personal information received by one Rainforest Alliance affiliate can be shared among other Rainforest Alliance affiliates.
* **Your organization**. When you create an account or do business with us as an employee, affiliate or member of an organization, we may share your information with your organization. For example, if you are a company employee registered in our certification and traceability apps, your username and transaction details may be shown to others within your company.
* **Business partners and other stakeholders.** We may share information with select business partners with whom we have business relationships, such as organizations who collaborate with us in projects and partnerships, as well as funders, grantees and subgrantees for projects and programmatic activities.
* **Certification program**. In addition to certification-related information made available to the general public as part of [public summaries](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/business/certification/certificate-search-and-public-summaries/), we share information received through our Certification Program (including contact information) with select third parties such as auditors and CBs in order to support the Certification Program, in accordance with our Certification Program standards, policies and rules. For example, we may share information with auditors to confirm certification audit data. We may also share anonymized and aggregated certification-related information with third party researchers.
* **Online training platform**. All information collected or received by us in the Rainforest Alliance Learning Network is used to measure the impact of this platform and the training content offered on it. To that end, we will provide learning-related information, such as the level of completion of courses and grades earned, to trainers, impact evaluators, the participants themselves and, in some cases, their employers. In addition, the Rainforest Alliance may share de-identified, aggregate information on participants’ performance data with select business partners for impact demonstration purposes.
* **Service providers**. Companies or individuals that provide services to the Rainforest Alliance or act on our behalf may have access to personal information about you. For example, we may disclose or provide access to information to consultants, IT vendors, vendors who collect or make payments for services, donations or royalties, and professional advisors such as auditors and attorneys. These service providers are limited in their ability to use information they receive in the course of providing their services to us and may not use information for any purposes other than the services for which we have engaged them.
* **Third Parties that provide content, advertising services, or functionality within our Online Services**. Some of the content, advertising, and functionality within our Online Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. Such third parties include:
    * Advertising providers, which help us provide ads that are tailored to users’ interests and understand how users respond to those ads; and
    * Audience-measurement companies, which help us measure the overall usage of our Online Services and compare that usage to other online services.
    * Some of these companies may participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more, please visit the websites of the [Network Advertising Initiative](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/).
* **Other parties in response to valid legal process or when necessary to protect our organization or our Services**. We may disclose your personal information to other parties, such as judicial, governmental or regulatory bodies, if:
    * It is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal processes (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena);
    * The personal information is relevant to a crime that has been or is being committed;
    * An emergency exists that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person; or
    * It is necessary to protect the rights or property of the Rainforest Alliance.
* **Change of control**. In the event that the ownership of the Rainforest Alliance or an affiliate or their assets changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale, transfer or other disposition of assets, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your personal information may be transferred to another company.
* **Aggregate information**. We may aggregate and/or de-identify personal information such that it is no longer linked to an individual. This Privacy Policy does not limit our ability to disclose aggregated or de-identified information that is not linked to you. We may use and disclose such non-personally identifiable information to donors, partners, stakeholders and any other third parties in our discretion for marketing, advertising, research, impact reporting, or other legitimate business purposes.

### **Cross-Border Data Transfers** 

The Rainforest Alliance is a global organization, with affiliates, suppliers and business partners located throughout the world, which means that your personal information may be transferred, stored, and processed outside of the country or region where it was initially collected.  Please be advised that your personal information may be transferred outside the country of your residence to a country that may not have laws with the same levels of protections as those of your home country.  For data subjects whose data was collected in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), please note that we may transfer your personal information to third countries outside of the EEA and the UK, which the European Commission (EC) or the UK data protection authorities may not have deemed “adequate” for information security purposes, including the United States (“**Third Countries**”).  We have in place appropriate and reasonable measures for the transfer of such personal information, including contractual measures requiring the protection of personal information.  For personal information transfers out of the EEA or the UK to Third Countries, we rely on the EC’s Standard Contractual Clauses.  If you require more information about our data transfer mechanisms, please contact [LegalTeam@ra.org](mailto:LegalTeam@ra.org). 

### **Our Commitment to Security** 

We employ appropriate and reasonable administrative, technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against loss or against any form of unlawful processing and shall impose such security obligations on any data processor we enlist. For example, we, or our data processor(s), shall use servers that have been placed in a controlled, secure environment, protected against unauthorized access.  

### **Children’s Privacy** 

Our Online Services are intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 16 without prior parental consent, except as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you are a parent who consents to the collection of personal information from your child, you agree that your child may use all of our Online Services and that we may collect, use, and disclose your child’s personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

### **Records Retention** 

Rainforest Alliance keeps records only for as long as they are needed for us to conduct our business and to comply with our legal obligations. We adhere to our Records Retention and Management Policy to determine which records shall be retained and for how long. A copy of our Records Retention and Management Policy can be obtained by contacting [LegalTeam@ra.org](mailto:legalteam@ra.org). 

### ****Data Subject Rights**** 

Subject to applicable law, you may have the following rights:

* The right to withdraw consent to our processing of your personal data at any time
* Receive a copy of or access to your personal data
* Request a copy of your personal data to be sent to a third party
* Restrict processing of your personal data
