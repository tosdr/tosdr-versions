2. the Customer and its Authorised Users must immediately cease using the Services;
    
3. the Customer must pay to Storypark all outstanding Fees payable up to the date of expiry or termination; and
    
4. both parties must immediately return or destroy (as requested) all material containing the other party’s Confidential Information or proprietary information, subject to a party’s right or requirement to retain copies of the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent:
    
    1. required for the purposes of compliance with law or internal corporate governance; or
        
    2. the Confidential Information is located in an archived back-up,
        
    

provided the parties will continue to comply with clause 10 with respect to such Confidential Information following termination of this Agreement.

14.2

If, at the date of expiry of this Agreement, the parties have not agreed on a Renewal Term (pursuant to clause 2.2) but instead wish to negotiate a new contract for services (and Storypark has agreed to continue providing Services during the period of negotiation), the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to continue to apply to the provision of such Services, until the earlier of:

1. entry by the parties into a new contract governing the provision of services; or
    
2. termination of this Agreement by either party on no less than 3 months prior written notice to the other party, in which case clause 14.1 shall apply.
    

15\. **Dispute Resolution**
---------------------------

15.1

A party may, at any time while there is a genuine dispute relating in any way to this Agreement (**Dispute**), give written notice (**Dispute Notice**) to the other party specifying the subject matter of the Dispute and requiring that an authorised senior representative of each party meet, within 10 Business Days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, to attempt to resolve the Dispute. The Representatives will make all reasonable attempts to resolve the dispute at the Dispute resolution meeting.

15.2

If the Representatives fail to resolve the Dispute under clause 15.1 within 10 Business Days of the Dispute Notice, or if either party fails or refuses to attend the Dispute Resolution Meeting, the parties will immediately be deemed to have submitted the Dispute to mediation in the country in which the Storypark entity that you are contracting with is registered. In the event of any submission to mediation:

1. the mediator will not be acting as an expert or as an arbitrator;
    
2. the mediator will determine the procedure and timetable for the mediation; and
    
3. the parties will share equally the cost of the mediation.
    

15.3

Neither party may issue legal proceedings (except for urgent injunctive relief) unless it first complies with clauses 15.1 and 15.2.
