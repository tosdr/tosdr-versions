In that case the Primary Account Holder agrees that the Child’s Early Childhood Provider has the authority to decide who has access to the Child Profile, as well as adding, editing and removing Content relating to the Child in that profile. If the Primary Account Holder does not wish to allow the Early Childhood Provider to have those rights, then they should either not invite them, or if the Early Childhood Provider has provisionally created a Child Profile for that Child, you should be asked to remove your Child from the Service (and they must act on such requests promptly).

If a Primary Account Holder provides their consent they are granting you (as the Early Childhood Provider) the right to add to or remove Content from their Child’s Child Profile (including any Child Content). Such Early Childhood Providers will be entitled to access that Child Profile and Child Content for as long as the Primary Account Holder permits;  
  
**2\.** must also ensure that any Content they upload to a Child Profile does not contain information, images or videos of any identifiable child other than the Child unless they have consent to do so from persons entitled to provide that consent on behalf of that other child;

* to Users who have been granted access to a Child Profile by the Primary Account Holder or, where applicable, an Early Childhood Provider;
    
* to Storypark’s personnel and any service provider or licensor that Storypark works with where necessary to operate the Service (any such persons must agree to equivalent obligations regarding confidentiality and privacy);
    
* where the information has been made anonymous or is aggregated into de-personalised information about curriculum use or other learning practices that may benefit the sector
    
* if the relevant Primary Account Holder gives Storypark permission to do so;
    
* in accordance with our Privacy Policy; or
