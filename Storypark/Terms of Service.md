15\. **Dispute Resolution**
---------------------------

15.1

A party may, at any time while there is a genuine dispute relating in any way to this Agreement (**Dispute**), give written notice (**Dispute Notice**) to the other party specifying the subject matter of the Dispute and requiring that an authorised senior representative of each party meet, within 10 Business Days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, to attempt to resolve the Dispute. The Representatives will make all reasonable attempts to resolve the dispute at the Dispute resolution meeting.

15.2

If the Representatives fail to resolve the Dispute under clause 15.1 within 10 Business Days of the Dispute Notice, or if either party fails or refuses to attend the Dispute Resolution Meeting, the parties will immediately be deemed to have submitted the Dispute to mediation in the country in which the Storypark entity that you are contracting with is registered. In the event of any submission to mediation:

1. the mediator will not be acting as an expert or as an arbitrator;
    
2. the mediator will determine the procedure and timetable for the mediation; and
    
3. the parties will share equally the cost of the mediation.
