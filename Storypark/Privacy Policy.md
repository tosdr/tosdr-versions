5\. Collection of Personal Data
-------------------------------

We collect Personal Data when you use our Services, and may also collect Personal Data about you or others when Service Users create Family Child Records or Organisation Child Records within the Service. For example, this may include cases where a child care organisation or educational institution your child attends is a user of the Services.  
  
We may collect the following categories of Personal Data in the following situations:

a) **Personal Data you voluntarily provide to us**: When you give us your Personal Data directly (whether face-to-face, by telephone, email, post, through social media or by communicating with us in any way), when we meet with an organisation wishing to do business with us and an individual from that organisation provides Personal Data about themselves, when you apply for a job with us, or when you sign up or register to become a Service User, or when you enter into a transaction with us you are voluntarily giving us the Personal Data that we collect.

* **Categories of Personal Data**: The Personal Data we may collect includes your name, physical address, email address, login for the Service, feedback and suggestions for the Service, IP address, phone number, billing information in accordance with our Customer Terms, occupation, employer, job title, area of responsibilities, employment history, and educational qualifications, and other such Personal Data you may provide to us.
    

b) **Our email marketing list**: When you become a Service User, or where you elect to sign up to our email marketing list, we may collect your name, email address, and email marketing preferences.

**c) Personal Data we collect automatically**: When you use our Service or browse our Website, we may collect information about your usage and web browsing. We may collect Personal Data as log files, or through cookies or other tracking technologies (see the “Cookies and tracking” below for more information), store it against the associated Account, and link it to the other Personal Data we hold about an Account.

* **Categories of Personal Data:** The Personal Data we may collect includes your IP address, your operating system, your browser ID, time, date, your browsing activity, your interaction with the Service (including any Content, comments, and general location).
    

**d) Personal Data uploaded and transferred to the Service by Service Users:** We collect Personal Data about persons (including Children) indirectly when Service Users use the Service, such as when a Service User:

* creates a Child Record or invites another person to become a Service User (including an invitation to become a Primary Account Holder or Authorised User);
    
* uploads and transfers Content that contains Personal Data (including photographs or videos of another person including Children, or uploads and transfers materials created by another person including Children); or

In situations where a Service User creates a Family Child Record containing Personal Data or uploads Personal Data to a Family Child Record, the Service User is a joint-controller of that Personal Data alongside us, (i.e. we process the Personal Data directly for the individual (or their parent/guardian) and for those purposes described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms, and exercise control over that processing), to the extent that term applies under applicable Data Protection Laws. In situations where a Service User creates an Organisation Child Record containing Personal Data or uploads Personal Data to an existing Organisation Child Record, we act as a processer in respect of that Personal Data, (i.e. we process the Personal Data for our Customer and for those purposes described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms, and the Customer exercises control over that processing), to the extent that term applies under applicable Data Protection Laws. We may have no direct relationship with the person whose Personal Data you upload or transfer, and for that reason, you are responsible for making sure you have the obtained all consents and issued all notices necessary for us to process information about any such person (including where Sensitive Data relating to a Child is collected and stored in the relevant Child Record).

7\. Lawful Basis for processing
-------------------------------

As permitted or required under applicable Data Protection Laws, we may rely on the following legal bases to process Personal Data.  
  
**Consent:** In jurisdictions where consent is the only lawful basis for processing, your provision of Personal Data to us means that you agree and consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data under this Privacy Policy. Please note that certain aspects of the Service can only be offered if you provide Personal Data to us and we may not be able to offer you certain aspects of the Service if you choose not to provide us with required Personal Data.

We may obtain your consent in different forms depending on the context of processing, such as:

* if you expressly sign or agree to a document through electronic means or verbally; or
    
* implicitly by providing the Personal Data voluntarily.
    

Please note that there are circumstances where the processing of Personal Data may be permitted without consent, or where we may or must disclose information without consent, in accordance with  applicable law.  
  
You have the right to revoke your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data that is under our control at any time. However, revocation of your consent does not have retroactive effect, and may prevent us from providing certain aspects of the Service to you; in such circumstances, we will discuss with you the reason we need your Personal Data and why the revocation of your consent affects our ability to provide the Service to you. Where your Personal Data is under the custody and/or control of our Customer or Customer Organization and we act as Data Processor on behalf of the Customer or Customer Organization, we may not be able to give effect to your request and will direct you to the Customer or Customer Organization.

**Performance of a contract**: Where contractual performance is a lawful basis for processing under Data Protection Laws, you acknowledge and agree that the processing identified below is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party (being the Agreement):

* to carry out user and account administration tasks;
    
* to manage and deliver the Service; and
    
* to manage any disputes (including disputes over invoices or delivery of the Service).
    

**Legitimate interests:**  Where legitimate interests is a lawful basis for processing under Data Protection Laws, in respect of all other processing of Personal Data detailed in this Privacy Policy (including direct marketing activities), such processing is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by Storypark, and we have assessed that such interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the persons to whom the Personal Data relates.  
  
You have the right to object to the way we process your Personal Data where the processing is based on legitimate interests. For more information see “Your Rights” section below.

**Data Processor:**  In respect of Personal Data uploaded and transferred to the Service by Service Users, to the extent the term applies under applicable Data Protection Laws, we are a joint data-controller alongside the relevant Service User who creates or updates a Family Child Record (i.e. we process the Personal Data directly for the individual (or their parent/guardian) and for those purposes described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms, and exercise control over that processing).  We are a Data Processor to the relevant Service User who creates or updates an Organisation Child Record, to the extent that terms applies under applicable Data Protection Laws (i.e. we process the Personal Data for our Customer and for those purposes described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms, and the Customer exercises control over that processing). In such circumstances, the relevant Service User has custody and/or control of the Personal Data and is responsible for determining the legal basis upon which that Personal Data is processed. Please see the End User Terms which outline the Service User’s obligations in this regard.

8\. Direct Marketing
--------------------

All those to whom we send direct marketing communications have the option to opt-out of receiving further direct marketing communications from us. If you do not wish to continue to receive direct marketing communications from us and/or selected third parties you should opt-out by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in any email communications that we might send you.  
  
Please note that some features of the Service may involve us providing, through the functionality within the Service, recommendations or suggestions for goods, services or benefits that we offer.

9\. Retention and deletion of Personal Data
-------------------------------------------

a) in some cases, retain a copy of your Personal Data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and to comply with our trust and safety obligations. Personal Data retained for these purposes will be archived and stored in a secure manner after your Account has been closed, and will not be accessed unless required for any of these reasons; and

b) retain Personal Data in an aggregated, de-identified or otherwise anonymous form, as permitted or required by applicable laws, such that there is no serious possibility of identifying you from the information.

10\. Disclosure of Personal Data
--------------------------------

We will not sell Personal Data to anyone.We share Personal Data with third parties for limited purposes, such as to help us run our business and provide the Website and Service. Those third parties can be categorised as follows:

a) **Service Users**: At the direction of a Customer, Customer Organisation or Primary Account Holder (as applicable) Storypark may disclose Content (which may contain Personal Data) through the Service to other Service Users. For example:

* The family version of the Service enables Service Users to tag posts and Content in a way as to identify particular interests of a Child or features of a Child’s development or progress. Storypark may be directed to disclose this Personal Data to an Authorised User (such as an Educator), to facilitate their understanding of the Child’s progress, development, interests etc.
    
* the Service will enable an Authorised User to access (and upload) sensitive information relating to a Child, solely for the purpose of their understanding of the Child’s progress, development, interests, etc.
    
* Educators may share stories from an Organisation Child Record with Authorised Users and Authorised Viewers.
    
* Authorised Viewers may view and/or access Child Content within the Application only to the extent authorised by a Primary Account Holder.
    
* Stories from an Organisation Child Record (which may include sensitive information of a Child) may also be shared by Authorised Users with other family members of a Child’s Storypark community. However, Authorised Users cannot disclose notes, routines or plans from an Organisation Child Record with any other family members of a Child’s Storypark community or any other parents or families.
    
* Educators may share group stories (which may include sensitive information of a Child) relating to two or more Children with family members from the Storypark community for the relevant Children.
    
* Educators may share group plans (which may include sensitive information of a Child) with the Primary Account Holders for all Children included in the group plan.
    
* Storypark may be directed to allow a Customer Organisation (or, if applicable a Customer that operates the Customer Organisation) to access an Educator portfolio and its associated Personal Data (where that Customer or Customer Organisation maintains the Account to which an Educator portfolio relates).
    

We may have no direct relationship with persons whose Personal Data you upload or transfer. For that reason and in relevant circumstances, you are responsible for making sure you have the appropriate consent and make the appropriate notifications for us to disclose any Content (which may contain Personal Data) in the manner you direct through the Service. To the extent necessary consent is not obtained, you must remove the applicable Personal Data from the Family Child Record without undue delay. Please see the End User Terms which outline your obligations in this regard.  
  
If you no longer want to be contacted by one of our Service Users, please contact the relevant Customer or Customer Organisation directly.

b) **Service providers**:  We share your Personal Data with our third party service providers, who help us provide and support our Service. For example:

1. Client relationship management services from Hubspot
    
2. Payment processing services from PayPal and Stripe
    
3. Subscription management and billing from Chargebee
    
4. Cloud server hosting services from Amazon Web Services
    
5. Content delivery services from Sendgrid, Transloadit, Brightcove

We limit the information we provide to third parties to the information they need to help us provide or facilitate the provision of goods and services and associated purposes. We ensure that third parties are required to meet the privacy standards required by law in handling your Personal Data, and use your Personal Data only for the purposes that we give it to them.

c) **Sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganisation, or acquisition**: If Storypark or substantially all of its assets were acquired by a third party, Personal Data which we hold may be one of the transferred assets (subject to the same constraints on use and disclosure as under this policy).

d) **Legal obligation**: If we are under a duty or have a legal right to disclose or share Personal Data in order to comply with any legal obligation or request or investigation issued by any Government entity, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our personnel or third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection, trust and safety and credit risk reduction.

**CCPA:** If you are based in California in the USA, we agree that we will not: (a) sell your Personal Data to any third party; (b) retain, use or disclose your Personal Data for any purpose other than as set out in this Privacy Policy and any other agreement you sign up to with us; (c) retain, use, or disclose your Personal Data for a commercial purpose other than as set out in this Privacy Policy and any other agreement you sign up to with us; or (d) retain, use, or disclose the Personal Data outside of the direct business relationship between them, other than as set out in this Privacy Policy and any other agreement you sign up to with us.

11\. Trans-border Personal Data flows
-------------------------------------

Storypark’s head office is located in New Zealand, so some limited Personal Data is transferred and/or stored there. For the purposes of the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, New Zealand has been recognized as providing adequate protection  
  
The vast majority of Personal Data we handle is stored and hosted in Australia. **All Personal Data relating to Children on Storypark is hosted in Australia.  
  
‍**Some limited Personal Data may be provided to companies located in the USA who offer software as a service products that process content for inclusion on the Service (for example, conversion of images and videos to make them suitable for viewing online/ through a web browser). Those third parties located overseas are not permitted to (and are contractually obligated to not) access or use the Personal Data provided except for those limited purposes. We only choose reputable service providers and have agreements with such third parties that prevent them from using or disclosing to others the Personal Data we share with them, other than as is necessary to assist us.  
  
In respect of the transfer of Personal Data to New Zealand, Canada, Australia, the USA and other countries, we will use reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from any third parties that they will safeguard Personal Data consistent with this Privacy Policy and all applicable Data Protection Laws.  
  
While the information resides outside of the territory where you reside, it may be accessible to the local courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in a foreign jurisdiction.

12\. Security of Personal Data
------------------------------

We have implemented reasonable technical, physical, and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data. We take reasonable steps to protect Personal Data, including through internal and external security, restricting access to Personal Data to those who have a need to know, maintaining technological products to prevent unauthorised computer access and regularly reviewing our technology to help maintain security. We choose technology partners considering their security and privacy policies and practices.  
  
Personal Data stored in our system is protected by electronic and procedural safeguards. We take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data from accidental loss and theft by storing it in secure data centres with off-site backups. Communication between Service Users and our servers is encrypted via industry-standard transport layer security (TLS).  
  
The Service is protected by a secure and encrypted password that each Service User must choose themselves. Service Users should never share their passwords. Storypark is not responsible for any loss of data or breach of privacy if a Service User shares their password with someone else. We do not store your password on our servers, instead we store a one-way hash of your password.  
  
Because internet transmissions cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, you acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that you use the Service at your own risk.  
  
In case of a security incident or any other breach of security safeguards, such as the loss of, unauthorised access to or unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data under Storypark’s control, we will respond in accordance with our obligations under applicable Data Protection Laws.
