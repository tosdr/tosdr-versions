**c) Personal Data we collect automatically:** When you use our Service or browse our Website, we may collect information about your usage and web browsing. We may collect the Personal Data as log files, or through cookies or other tracking technologies (see the “Cookies and tracking” below for more information), store it against the associated Account, and link it to the other Personal Data we hold about an Account.

* **Categories of Personal Data:** The Personal Data we may collect includes your IP address, your operating system, your browser ID, time, date, your browsing activity, your interaction with the Service (including any Content, comments, and location).

In these situations any such Service User is a joint data-controller along with us in respect of such Personal Data. We have no direct relationship with any person other than you, and for that reason, you are responsible for making sure you have the appropriate permission for us to collect and process information about any such person (including where Sensitive Data relating to a Child is collected and stored in the relevant Child Record).

**a) Service Users:** At the direction of a Customer, Customer Organisation or Primary Account Holder (as applicable)Storypark shall disclose Content (which may contain Personal Data) through the Service to other Service Users. For example:

* The family version of the Service enables Service Users to tag posts and Content in a way as to identify particular interests of a Child or features of a Child’s development or progress. Storypark may be directed to disclose this Personal Data to an Authorised User (such as an Educator), to facilitate their understanding of the Child’s progress, development, interests etc.
    
* the Service will enable an Authorised User to access (and upload) Sensitive Information relating to a Child, solely for the purpose of their understanding of the Child’s progress, development, interests, etc.
    
* Educators may share stories from an Organisation Child Record with Authorised Users (including any person invited by the Primary Account Holder to have access to that Child’s stories).
    
* Stories from an Organisation Child Record (which may include Sensitive Information of a Child) may also be shared by Authorised Users with other family members of a Child’s Storypark community, However, Authorised User’s cannot disclose notes, routines or plans from an Organisation Child Record with any other family members of a Child’s Storypark community or any other parents or families.
    
* Educators may share group stories (which may include Sensitive information of a Child) relating to two or more Children with family members from the Storypark community for the relevant Children. 
    
* Educators may share group plans (which may include Sensitive information of a Child) with the Primary Account Holders for all Children included in the group plan. 
    
* Storypark may be directed to allow a Customer Organisation (or, if applicable a Customer that operates the Customer Organisation) to access an Educator portfolio and its associated Personal Data (where that Customer or Customer Organisation maintains the Account to which an Educator portfolio relates).
    

We have no direct relationship with any person other than you, and for that reason, you are responsible for making sure you have the appropriate permission for us to disclose any Content (which may contain Personal Data) in the manner you direct through the Service. Please see the End User Terms which outline your obligations in this regard.  
  
If you no longer want to be contacted by one of our Service Users, please contact the relevant Customer or Customer Organisation directly.  
  
**b) Service providers:** We share your Personal Data with our third party service providers, who help us provide and support our Service. For example:

* Organisations who carry out credit, fraud and other security checks;
    
* Payment processors;
    
* Hosting services;
    
* Content delivery services;
    
* IT support providers; and
    
* Marketing businesses engaged by us to disseminate materials to which recipients have consented.
    

We limit the information we provide to third parties to the information they need to help us provide or facilitate the provision of goods and services and associated purposes. We deal with third parties that are required to meet the privacy standards required by law in handling your Personal Data, and use your Personal Data only for the purposes that we give it to them.  
‍  
**c) Sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganisation, or acquisition:** If Storypark or substantially all of its assets were acquired by a third party, Personal Data which we hold may be one of the transferred assets (subject to the same constraints on use and disclosure as under this policy).  
  
**d) Legal obligation:** If we are under a duty or have a legal right to disclose or share Personal Data in order to comply with any legal obligation or request or investigation issued by any Government agency, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our personnel or third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection, trust and safety and credit risk reduction.  
  
**CCPA:** If you are based in California in the USA, we agree that we will not: (a) sell your Personal Data to any third party; (b) retain, use or disclose your Personal Data for any purpose other than as set out in this Privacy Policy and any other agreement you sign up to with us; (c) retain, use, or disclose your Personal Data for a commercial purpose other than as set out in this Privacy Policy and any other agreement you sign up to with us; or (d) retain, use, or disclose the Personal Data outside of the direct business relationship between them, other than as set out in this Privacy Policy and any other agreement you sign up to with us.

### 11\. Trans-border Personal Data flows

Storypark’s head office is located in New Zealand, so some limited Personal Data is transferred and/or stored there. For the purposes of the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, New Zealand has been recognized as providing adequate protection  
  
The vast majority of Personal Data we handle is stored and hosted in Australia. **All Personal Data relating to Children on Storypark is hosted in Australia.  
  
‍**Some limited Personal Data may be provided to companies located in the USA who offer software as a service products that process content for inclusion on the Service (for example, conversion of images and videos to make them suitable for viewing online/ through a web browser). Those third parties located overseas are not permitted to (and are contractually obligated to not) access or use the Personal Data provided except for those limited purposes. We only choose reputable service providers and have agreements with such third parties that prevent them from using or disclosing to others the Personal Data we share with them, other than as is necessary to assist us.  
  
In respect of the transfer of Personal Data to New Zealand, Canada, Australia, the USA and other countries, we will use reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from any third parties that they will safeguard personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy and all applicable Data Protection Laws.  
  
While the information resides outside of the territory where you reside, it may be accessible to the local courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in a foreign jurisdiction.

### 12\. Security of Personal Data

We take all reasonable steps to protect Personal Data, including through internal and external security, restricting access to Personal Data to those who have a need to know, maintaining technological products to prevent unauthorised computer access and regularly reviewing our technology to maintain security. We choose technology partners based on their security and privacy policies and practices.  
  
Personal Data stored in our system is protected by electronic and procedural safeguards. We take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data (and other content) from accidental loss and theft by storing it in secure data centres with off-site backups. Communication between Service Users and our servers is encrypted via industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL).  
‍  
The Service is protected by a secure and encrypted password that each Service User must choose themselves. Service Users should never share their passwords. Storypark is not responsible for any loss of data or breach of privacy if a Service User shares their password with someone else. We do not store your password on our servers.  
‍  
Because internet transmissions cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, you acknowledge and agree that you use the Service at your own risk.  
‍  
In case of a security incident or any other breach of security safeguards, such as the loss of, unauthorised access to or unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data under Storypark’s control, we will respond in accordance with our obligations under applicable Data Protection Laws.

### 13\. Your Rights

You have the right to access your readily retrievable Personal Data that we hold about you, and to ask for it to be corrected if you think it is wrong.

* in certain circumstances, have your Personal Data erased;
    
* restrict the processing of your Personal Data;

If you are a resident of California, you have the right under the CCPA:

* to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of Personal Data (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared Personal Data in the immediately preceding calendar year;
    
* subject to certain exceptions, to request the deletion of your Personal Data that we have collected from you; and
    
* subject to certain exceptions, not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your CCPA privacy rights.
    

We will respond to any request made in respect of the above in accordance with the applicable Data Protection Laws.  
  
Please note that in certain circumstances we may refuse to respond to a rights request where we have the right to do so under applicable Data Protection Laws, for example, where a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.  
  
Requests for such access and correction requirements can be made to the contact details in section 15 of this Privacy Policy.  
  
Please note that where we are not, or are no longer, in a position to identify you within the information we hold (including because of any de-identification techniques we may have employed), then your rights as described above shall not apply.  
  
We will respond to any request made in respect of the above without delay, but in any case within one (1) month of a request, or two (2) months where the requests are complex or numerous (in which case, we will inform you of such delay).

### 14\. Cancelling your Account

If your Storypark Account terminates (for whatever reason), the Personal Data associated with it may no longer be accessible to you. Any Content you have posted from your Account may still be available to other Service Users that the Content has been associated with. There may continue to be residual copies of such Content due to ongoing data back-up and archiving.
