4.4 Third parties**

We may receive Personal Data about you from various third parties.

**5\. Disclosure of your Personal Data**

We may share your Personal Data with third parties, as listed, for the purposes described in section 3. In certain cases, we will obtain express consent before sharing your Personal Data with third parties, if required by applicable laws.

**5.1 Internal Third Parties** 

All companies in the Behaviour Interactive group, who are based in Canada, United States and Europe may have access to your Personal Data for purposes of providing the Services and, if they do, they will use your Personal Data in accordance with this Policy.

**5.2 External Third Parties**

We may share your Personal Data with some third parties, but only for purposes we have set out in section 3 of this Policy.  A list of third parties, suppliers or partners which may have access to your Personal Data is available at: [**https://www.bhvr.com/partnerprivacy/**](https://www.bhvr.com/partnerprivacy/)**.**

We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions and contractual obligations we enter with them.

**6\. Location and Transfer of Your Personal Data**

Personal Data may be hosted and processed, for the purposes of the Policy, on servers operated by trusted partners in the United States, such as Amazon Web Services, as well as on our servers or our partners’ servers located in Canada or in Europe. If you are based in the European Union, this may involve transferring your Personal Data outside the UK or the European Economic Area (“EEA”). If you are based in Canada or US, this may involve transferring your Personal Data outside Canada or US. Some of our external third parties are based outside of these jurisdictions so their processing of your Personal Data will also involve a transfer accordingly. Whenever Personal Data is transferred from the EEA, UK, Canada or US, to a location outside of these jurisdictions (as applicable), we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it. As applicable, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission or the UK Information Commissioner’s Office which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe and/or the UK.  By submitting your Personal Data or engaging with the Services, you consent to this transfer, storage, use, or processing.

**7\. Retention Period of Personal Data**

We keep your Personal Data only for the period required for the purposes for which the Personal Data is collected, as well as for the purposes of satisfying any legal, or reporting requirements.

In some circumstances, we will anonymize your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. Otherwise, your Personal Data will be deleted.

**8\. Safeguards of your Personal Data**

BHVR takes different measures for the security of your Personal Data.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.  Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to protect your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way.

We will collect and store Personal Data on your device using application data caches and other technology.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will promptly notify you, and regulators where applicable, of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

9.2        You will not have to pay to exercise your legal rights above. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

If you are a US resident, we encourage you to learn more about privacy rights of your State of residence.
