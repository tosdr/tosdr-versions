### **II. Privacy & Data Collection**

Your privacy is important to us. Please read BHVR’s privacy policy (“**Privacy Policy**”) carefully for information relating to BHVR’s collection and use of personal information. You can find the Privacy Policy at [https://www.bhvr.com/behaviour-privacy/](https://www.bhvr.com/behaviour-privacy/).

You understand, acknowledge and agree that public communications on BHVR Services, including www.bhvr.com are not private or confidential, and may be viewed and used by others accessing the BHVR Services.

### **III. Account**

_**A.     Opening & Maintaining Account**_

While some BHVR Services may be generally accessed by the public, certain aspects of the Website (e.g. posting in the forums) and the use of certain BHVR Services requires you to create an account (the “**Account**”). If you have questions about registration for an Account, please contact us at [https://support.bhvr.com](https://support.bhvr.com/).

Only “natural persons,” as opposed to any kinds of legal entities (e.g., corporations, limited liability companies, and/or partnerships), shall have the privilege of establishing an Account. By entering into this Agreement and creating an Account, you represent that you are an adult and have the legal capacity to enter into a contract in the jurisdiction where you reside. You agree to comply with this Agreement on behalf of yourself and, at your discretion, any minor children for whom you are the parent or legal guardian and whom you have authorized to play the Game using your Account and/or authorized to use the Website. You further agree that you are entirely liable for all activities conducted through your Account, and are responsible for ensuring that you and/or your child is aware of, understands, and complies with the terms of this Agreement and any and all other Overall Terms.

To create an Account, you must have an email address, and provide truthful and accurate information. Please note that in utilizing certain areas of the Website (e.g. purchasing certain merchandise), you will be requested to provide additional information such as your name, full address and in some cases, payment information. You must be eligible to use the BHVR Service for which you are registering. Some BHVR Services require the creation of a “username” or a “persona.” Usernames and personas are tied to your Account. You may not use a username or persona that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, or otherwise violates the Terms of Use. BHVR reserves the right to block or remove any username or persona, if the use thereof violates the Terms of Use, any Overall Terms, laws or regulations, including, without limitation, personality rights, or trademarks.

You are solely responsible for all activity on your Account including purchases, whether or not authorized by you. Your Account may be terminated if someone else uses it to engage in activity that violates the Terms of Use or is otherwise improper or illegal. You should not reveal your Account password to others. BHVR will not ask you to reveal your password, or initiate contact with you asking for answers to your password security questions.

We follow generally accepted rules in the video game industry, as well as applicable regulations to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information. We strive to use appropriate organizational and technical means to safeguard the security of your personal information, however, no security measures are 100% effective. In the event you become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including without limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your personal information , you must immediately notify BHVR by emailing [https://support.bhvr.com](https://support.bhvr.com/). In addition, submissions made via e-mail are not protected by encryption and are vulnerable to interception during transmission.

_**B.      Specific Terms for a Single Account**_

BHVR may, at its discretion, allow you to open one single account (“**Single Account**”) which may be connected across different platforms including without limitation Steam, Nintendo Switch and Stadia (the “**Platform(s)**”) which shall enable cross-progression within a Game across said Platforms. Once one Platform is connected to a Single Account, you may only be able to add or remove a unique account from such Platform to the Single Account. Should you wish to modify the Platform account linked to the Single Account, you may do so only at the frequency detailed on the Website applicable to the Game.

If you make a purchase of a limited license to use a Virtual Good on a Platform, you will be able to access it from all Platforms connected to your Single Account, except for certain Virtual Goods which are subject to licensing restrictions, and except for Game Currency. The Game Currency is non-transferable from one Platform to another.

Further, in the event you choose to disconnect one of your Platforms from the Single Account (“**Platform Disconnection**”), you acknowledge and agree that (i) you may lose the progression within the Game that happened while such Platform was linked to the Single Account, and that (ii) the Virtual Goods acquired and/or purchased on such Platform while it was linked to the Single Account may be lost after such Platform Disconnection. For purposes of clarity, Virtual Goods only remain valid in the Platform account associated with such purchase.

If your Account is terminated pursuant to the Terms of Use or any other Overall Terms, or if you are banned from the Game and/or the Website for any reason and for any period of time, the ban or termination shall be valid on all Platforms on which the Account or Single Account is connected and/or the equipment linked to such Account or Single Account.

_**C.      Virtual Goods**_

You agree that BHVR reserves the right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate, game elements, including but not limited to Virtual Goods.

For the purposes herein, “**Virtual Goods**” refers to virtual items (including without limitation, characters, accessories, items such as “character customization”, power-ups, “skins”), points, credits, tokens and in-game currency (“**Game Currency**”) for use in the Game.

All Virtual Goods remain the property of BHVR. You acknowledge that BHVR may, in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, modify features, functions or abilities of any element of its Games or any Virtual Goods (which may, among other things, make the Virtual Goods substantially more valuable, effective or functional, or less valuable, effective or functional, more common or less common, or eliminated entirely). You acknowledge and agree that all Virtual Goods represent a limited license right governed by the Overall Terms, and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from BHVR at any time.

BHVR may offer you the ability to acquire licenses to use Virtual Goods, such as by: (a) creating an Account or Single Account and “earning” a limited license to use Virtual Goods or (b) purchasing a limited license to use Virtual Goods for a fee or (c) participating in a contest or in in-game events and earning a limited license to use Virtual Goods.

All purchase or grant of Virtual Goods, whether made with “real money” or virtual currencies, are final and cannot be transferred, refunded, returned, replaced or exchanged for any sum of money, monetary value or virtual currency from BHVR at any time. The Virtual Goods are not redeemable for “real money” or monetary value from BHVR or any other person. BHVR does not have an obligation to exchange the Game Currency for anything of value, including but not limited to, real currency.  BHVR, in its sole discretion, has the absolute right to modify, replace, suspend, cancel or eliminate Virtual Goods, without notice.

The Game Currency is non-transferable from one Platform to another.

Note that depending on the country in which you are located, the validity period of purchased Virtual Goods may be limited to a certain period under applicable laws of certain jurisdictions. Further, BHVR and/or its licensors have the absolute right to regulate, discontinue, update, modify or eliminate any Virtual Goods at any time in its sole discretion, including their availability on Platforms and/or in the Account or Single Account. BHVR and its licensors shall have no liability to you or anyone else for these actions.

_**D.     Subscriptions**_

BHVR may offer subscription plans (the “Subscription(s)”) for certain Games which will enable you the benefits detailed on the Game and/or Game’s Website, including but not limited to, the ability to “earn” various Products.

Except for a limited period where the Subscription may be offered for free, a Subscription fee will be charged on the specific billing date indicated on your Account page and/or in the Game.  You must provide a valid payment method to register for a Subscription, and BHVR may ask you to update your payment method at any time if it becomes invalid.

By agreeing to these Terms of Use and purchasing a recurring Subscription, you will have agreed to permit BHVR and/or its partners to automatically renew your Subscription to a BHVR Service by charging a valid credit card number which you have provided to BHVR and/or its partners.

Should your subscription renew automatically, recurring renewal payments will be taken from the payment method you selected at sign-up, unless and until you change your payment method and/or it becomes invalid, or until you cancel your Subscription according to the details provided on your Account page and/or in the Game. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration of the payment method, insufficient funds, or otherwise, BHVR may suspend your access to the Game until having successfully charged a valid payment method. Unless required by applicable law, the Subscription is non-refundable and non-transferable.

**Subject to applicable law, and unless specifically stated in the Subscription at the moment of purchase or registration, if you subscribe to a renewable Subscription, you agree that at the end of the initial Subscription period and each renewal period thereafter, your Subscription fee will AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE APPLICABLE PERIOD (e.g. MONTHLY, WEEKLY, ETC.) at the then-current Subscription price (plus applicable taxes) on each renewal date without any additional action by you UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.**

BHVR will provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least fifteen (15) business days in advance by posting such changes on the Website and/or in the Game. If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your Subscription at any time in accordance with the cancellation procedures applicable to each Platform and detailed on your Account page and/or in the Game, but BHVR will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your Subscription, and it will not prorate fees for any subscription, except in accordance with the rules of the applicable Platform. If your use of BHVR Services is subject to use or sales tax, then BHVR may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the Subscription fee or other fees. **You must cancel your Subscription in advance prior to the renewal date, and at least by the amount of time detailed on your Account page and/or in the Game, in order to avoid renewal charges.**

For some BHVR Services, BHVR may offer a free trial Subscription. If you accept a free trial Subscription, BHVR will begin to bill your Account for that BHVR Service when the free trial Subscription expires, unless you cancel your Subscription before that time, as detailed in the Game and/or in the Website. You are always responsible for any Internet service provider, telephone, wireless and other connection fees that you may incur when using BHVR Services, even when BHVR offers a free trial Subscription. Trial subscriptions are not transferable.

You may not combine, transfer or exchange your Subscription with or to other users or accounts for any reason, failure of which may result in suspension or termination of your Subscription and/or Account.

BHVR reserves its rights to cancel, suspend or terminate your access to the Subscription if it suspects activity that is contrary to the Terms of Use and any code of conduct applicable to the Game and/or any applicable law or regulation. If your Subscription is cancelled or otherwise terminated by BHVR, you may immediately lose access to the Games.

* Your payment is a deposit to be used for (a) the production and delivery cost for the package (“Package Cost”), and (b) the development and production cost of the Game, including the Website cost, and BHVR’s corporate expenses associated with the foregoing (the “Game Cost”).
* The deposit shall be earned by BHVR and become non-refundable to the extent that it is used for the Package Cost and the Game Cost, with your deposit being applied as follows: (a) first to the Package Cost, and then (b) to the Game Cost in a percentage equal to the total applied Game Cost in relation to the total deposits of all contributors remaining after the Package Cost.
* BHVR agrees to use its good faith business efforts to deliver to you the packages and the Game on or before the estimated delivery date. However, you acknowledge and agree that delivery as of the estimated delivery date is not under any circumstances a representation provided by BHVR since unforeseen events may extend the development and/or production time. Accordingly, you agree that any unearned portion of the deposit shall not be refundable until and unless BHVR has failed to deliver the pledged items and/or the Game to you within 12 months after the estimated delivery date.
* For the avoidance of doubt, in consideration of BHVR’s good faith efforts to develop, produce, and deliver the Game with the funds raised, you agree that any deposit amounts earned by BHVR and applied against the Package Cost and the Game Cost as described above shall be non-refundable regardless of whether or not BHVR is able to complete and deliver the Game and/or the pledged items. In the unlikely event that BHVR is not able to deliver the Game and/or the pledged items, BHVR agrees to post an audited cost accounting on its Website to fully explain the use of the deposits for the Game Cost and the pledged item cost. In consideration of the promises by BHVR hereunder, you agree to irrevocably waive any claim for refund of any deposit amount that has been used for the Game Cost and Package Cost in accordance with the above.
* Once BHVR has made all items available to you and the Game has been commercially released to the public, all your payments for any BHVR Services until such time shall become, and any payments thereafter shall be non-refundable in whole or in part.

_**B.      Payment Options and Information**_

BHVR does not receive any confidential payment data from its payment providers, and BHVR is not responsible for their performance. You must promptly update all information with the payment provider to keep your billing account current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, the credit card number, or the credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify BHVR if your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft). Changes to such information can be made by contacting customer service at [https://support.bhvr.com](https://support.bhvr.com/). Customers who use a payment method other than a credit card may incur an additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically renew Subscriptions. Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with the third party payment providers are under your responsibility. BHVR reserves the right to change such payment providers at any time without notice.

As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends.

This includes the right to promote the Fan Content, e.g. by sharing or reposting it on our official channels or in marketing assets or include them in the Games.  BHVR is entitled, but not obliged to use your name or nickname as means of attribution.

The Fan Content is not a joint, collective or collaborative work under any applicable laws. You agree to include BHVR’s trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights notices, as provided on the Website and/or Game, when displaying Fan Content, and agree to comply with usage guidelines that may be provided by BHVR from time to time. You shall not remove or alter any identifying information or copyright management information conveyed in connection with copies of Fan Content or Content, including in digital form; nor challenge BHVR’s or its licensors’ ownership of the Content, nor use or adopt any trademarks that might be confusingly similar to such Content.

BHVR reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the Fan Content which are not expressly granted herein. You shall not rent, lease, reproduce, modify, translate or create derivative works of the Fan Content except as expressly permitted herein, nor create any derivative works (including without limitation fiction or visual art) from, or in any way exploit, any of the heroes, weapons, other Content contained in the Game or on the Website, without the express written permission of BHVR. BHVR does not consent to the protection under the copyright laws of any unauthorized derivative work.

This policy is aimed at avoiding potential misunderstandings or disputes when BHVR’s products or services might seem similar to Unsolicited Ideas that are submitted.

If you do submit your Unsolicited Ideas to BHVR or to any of its employees and/or contractors despite this policy and regardless of what your letter says, then you hereby acknowledge and agree that, from the time of transmission or dispatch, you grant BHVR, and its designees a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable, transferable, assignable, non-exclusive and royalty-free right and license to use, reproduce, distribute, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have made, sell, offer for sale and import your Unsolicited Ideas, including, without limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, industrial rights and all other intellectual and proprietary rights related thereto, in any media now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, including, without limitation, giving the Unsolicited Ideas to others, without any compensation to you.  You also give up any claim that any use by BHVR and/or its licensees of your Unsolicited Ideas violates any of your rights, including but not limited to moral rights, privacy rights, rights to publicity, proprietary or other rights, and/or rights to credit for the material or ideas set for therein.

### **VI. Special Terms: Playtests and/or Beta Testing**

In its sole discretion, BHVR may contact you to review and evaluate the Games, aspects or modules of the Games, or online features as part of, or prior to a wider Alpha test, Beta test, or commercial release thereof (hereafter “**Pre-Release Games**”) for the purposes identified with you prior to testing the Pre-Release Games. You will be asked to provide to BHVR certain feedback and suggestions regarding your experiences while reviewing and evaluating the Pre-Release Games and/or any other Content or Games. This process is referred to herein as a “**Play Test**”. If it is a closed Play Test, BHVR may ask you to enter into a confidentiality agreement (“**Confidentiality Agreement**”) for each specific Play Test BEFORE you are allowed to be a tester (“**Tester**”) and BEFORE any software is provided or made accessible to you. In such case, your participation as a Tester is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, in addition to the following terms and conditions which apply to all Pre-Release Tests and/or to Play Test terms which you must accept prior to participating in such a test. Furthermore, as a participant, you have to comply with all the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and all rules applicable to Play Tests.

In connection with the Play Test, BHVR may provide you, on a temporary basis, Pre-Release Games, as well as any other Games, Content, and/or confidential and proprietary information (collectively, “**Pre-Release Materials**”). You understand and agree that the Pre-Release Materials are confidential or proprietary information of BHVR. You agree as a condition of participating in a Play Test to (i) not copy or reproduce the Pre-Release Materials, (ii) safeguard the Pre-Release Materials and prevent unauthorized access to, reproduction of, disclosure of and/or unauthorized use of, the Pre-Release Materials, and (iii) if applicable, fully comply with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to Pre-Release Materials to any other person. You agree that breach of the above obligations will cause irreparable harm to BHVR, and BHVR is entitled to (in addition to any other remedies available to it) ex parte injunctive relief without bond to prevent the breach or threatened breach of your obligations. Your obligation to keep the Pre-Release Materials confidential will continue until BHVR publicly distributes, or has otherwise disclosed to the public through no fault of yours, the Pre-Release Materials and the Content that you are testing.

Upon request, you agree to immediately delete all copies of the Pre-Release Material which BHVR provided to you.

Nothing in these Terms of Use or any other Overall Terms shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the Pre-Release Materials or other Content. The Pre-Release Games are provided for testing on an “as is” and “as available” basis and BHVR makes no warranty to you of any kind, express or implied.

By participating in a Play Test, you agree that: (I) playing Pre-Release Games is at your own risk and you know that the Pre-Release Games may include known or unknown bugs, (ii) any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time, (iii) BHVR has no obligation to make these Pre-Release Games available for play with or without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all, (iv) BHVR’s Terms of Use, Play Test specific terms and Privacy Policy apply to your use of the Pre-Release Games during the testing phase, and (v) if it is a closed Play Test, you will keep all information about the Pre-Release Materials confidential as stated above and not disclose such information to any other person.

Play Test accounts are non-transferable under any circumstances.

### **VII. Special Terms: Contests**
