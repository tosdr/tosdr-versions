Privacy Policy
==============

The following page outlines how WhatPulse uses and protects any information that you give WhatPulse when using this website or the software client.

WhatPulse is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement. WhatPulse may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. By using any services of WhatPulse you agree to this privacy policy.

##### Information Collected

WhatPulse only collects information (be it via a website form or the software client) that is relevant to the purpose of our website. When you register for a WhatPulse account, we will ask you for your name (as provided) and valid e-mail address.

The software client collects statistics from your computer(s) as you direct it too. The types of statistics can vary and you have the ability to turn off each individual type of statistic. When you 'pulse' to our website, the software client will only send the data you have allowed it to send.

The information collected with the WhatPulse client is only used for analytics as shown on the website. Information linked to your account will never be sold or handed over to a third party. Only aggregated, anonymized data may be used for global analytics by third parties, on-site advertisements or marketing purposes.

In summary,

We collect relevant information so you can participate in our website and application. You have complete control what statistics are gathered. We don't sell your personal information and stats.

##### Analytical Cookies & Usage Data

At WhatPulse, we utilize Plausible Analytics, routed through our stats subdomain, on our website to gain insights into visitor behavior and assess the efficacy of our marketing efforts. We have selected Plausible Analytics due to its privacy-centric approach, which prioritizes anonymized aggregate data over personally identifiable information. No cookies are used and no personal data‚Äînot even an IP address or browser user agent‚Äîis stored. For more information on how Plausible Analytics handles data, please refer to their [Data Policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

On the WhatPulse client application, Plausible Analytics is used as the backend to process usage data. Similar to the website, we track aggregated behavior, such as what pages and sections you looked at, for how long, and so on. This data is completely anonymized by randomly generating a Client ID per installation, which is not linked to your account in any way. This information is important to us for improving the user experience and determining WhatPulse client effectiveness and helps us prioritize features. If you would like to stop the WhatPulse client from collecting and sending your usage data, please disable the option called **Send bug and usage reports**. [Click here for more information](https://whatpulse.org/help/docs/software/settings/client-bug-and-usage-reports) about the content, process, and usage of the data described here.

In summary,

We collect anonymized and aggregated data on the website and WhatPulse client, to see which parts of our products are being used. This information is important to us for improving the user experience and helps us prioritize features. You can disable this.

##### Third-Party Services - Payment Providers

WhatPulse uses Paddle as its payment provider to handle transactions for premium memberships. Paddle is a third-party service that securely processes payments and stores data related to those transactions, including order details, billing information, and other relevant data necessary to process and manage payments. In addition to processing payments, Paddle also provides notification to WhatPulse about premium memberships, so we can activate premium features for our users.

We use third-party payment providers for Premium, which collect and process payment information.
