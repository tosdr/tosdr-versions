FORVO provides its services in accordance with its Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy. FORVO reserves the right to modify and update this Privacy Policy at any time. All changes will be posted on our website, and any interested party can consult the latest version of this Privacy Policy at any time at [https://forvo.com/privacy/](https://forvo.com/privacy/). The fact of continuing to use the service or the website after such changes have been made will be considered as an acceptance by you of the new Privacy Policy.

This policy contains the following information:

* Information and identification of our company and its legal consideration as responsible.
* The personal data we process;
* How and why, we process your personal data;
* When and why, we might disclose your personal data to other companies or organizations;
* International data transfers;
* The rights that protect you and your options regarding your personal data;

**Controler**: FORVO MEDIA S.L., (FORVO). NIF: B20987541. Address: Txirrita Maleo 1, planta 1, 20100 - Renteria, Gipuzkoa, Spain. Gipuzkoa Commercial Registry: Volume: 2, 408 - Page: 153 Vto - Inscription: 2nd - Section: 8th - Page: SS-31.114, is the controller that determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data according whit this Privacy Policy.

**Personal Data**: Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. In this sense, an identifiable natural person is considered to be any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, by an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social elements of that person.

Usually, we process the personal information that the user provides for commercial contracting or subscription of a service, the information generated through the provision of the same, as well as the data generated or estimated by us. Based on the principle of minimization, the data that we can process will be adequate, relevant and limited to those necessary for the purposes for which they are processed, always respecting the user's will.

The data and information that we may process as a result of the use or subscription of the services are as follows:

* When a user account is created, FORVO collects personal information such as your username, email address, date of birth, gender, spoken or studied language.
* FORVO also collects and automatically generates information from other areas of use, such as service metadata, login information, device information, IP addresses, third-party data and information obtained from cookies. We may also collect, use and share aggregated data, such as statistical or demographic data, for any purpose. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data, but, under the law, is not considered personal data as it does not reveal your identity either directly or indirectly. In no case will we collect any special category of personal data concerning you (which includes information about your race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership and your health or genetic or biometric data).

By using or subscribing to the Services, you can set up your personal profile, establish relationships, send and receive messages through the Services, and perform searches and queries.

There is no legal or contractual obligation to provide this data, but in the event that it is not provided, we will be unable to provide the service.

**Purposes processing of your data:**
-------------------------------------

The personal data provided by users of the services will be processed by FORVO for the following purposes:

* To provide, update, maintain and protect the Services, websites, applications and activities;
* To manage and track the contractual and pre-contractual relationship that FORVO maintains with users;
* To comply with applicable legislation, legal procedure or regulation;
* To respond to your questions, comments and requests;
* To send you commercial and/or advertising communications, including, among others, emails, push notifications, SMS and messages within the application about the services;
* For statistical purposes, internal reporting, in a dissociated manner,
* For billing, economic management of accounts/services and administrative matters related to the Services;
* To investigate and help prevent security problems, third-party claims and/or abuse;
* For other purposes, to the extent that these are described at the time of collection.

The user should be aware that if they enter payment data from or related to any credit or debit card when purchasing or contracting any of the Services (including any subscription), FORVO does not receive or store this information, as it is received, stored and used by our payment service providers in order to complete the purchase (stripe.com, maybe an example).

The user can opt out of receiving promotional communications from FORVO when registering or subscribing to the Services. They can also opt out of receiving any communication, email, push notification or SMS in the same message.

Registration for the Services can be done by synchronizing with third-party services (Log-in with Facebook, Apple or Google account). If you follow a link to these websites, please note that you are sharing your profile information with us. The personal data shared depends on the settings of your Facebook, Apple or Google Platform. Visit the Platform related and review its privacy policy to understand how your personal data is shared and used in this context. The data we collect from your profile are email address, phone number and photograph (if they are configured in the profile), name and surname, gender, date of birth and city of residence.

**Lawfulness of processing your personal data. -**
--------------------------------------------------

Managing your registration as a user of the Services: The processing of your data is necessary for the execution of the terms that regulate the use and access to the Services. You are giving us your consent by accepting this privacy policy through the established consent mechanisms (links and verification check). Similarly, we consider that we have a legitimate interest to carry out the necessary checks to detect and prevent possible frauds when registering.

Sending of commercial communications: The lawfulness of processing is the express consent that you grant us (for example: when you authorize the sending of advertising or our newsletter).

Management of incidents related to the use of the Services: The processing is necessary for the execution of the contractual relationship maintained with you. When the query is related to the exercise of the rights that we inform you about below, or with claims related to our services, what legitimizes us to treat the data is the fulfillment of legal obligations on our part.

**Data storage periods.**
-------------------------

In compliance with the principle of limitation of the storage period, the data will be processed exclusively by the time necessary and for the purposes for which they have been collected at each moment. They will therefore be maintained in such a way as to allow the identification of the interested parties for no longer than necessary for the purposes of the processing of personal data. In accordance with the above, we have established the following retention periods that will be applicable, unless a different period has been specified in this Privacy Policy or in the conditions of provision of each of the products and services that include the FORVO brand.

* To carry out the processing related to the execution of the contract, the data will be kept for as long as is strictly necessary to fulfill the purposes required by each Service. For example, data obtained from the user will be kept while they are active; and information about traffic, navigation and location will be treated for a period that can range from 3 to 12 months to comply with the obligations of maintaining network security or preventing fraud.
* In accordance with civil, commercial and tax legislation, data related to the contracting and invoicing of contracted services will be stored for a period of 8 years from the user's deactivation.

After the above indicated deadlines, the data may be destroyed, blocked or anonymized, as appropriate, and in accordance with the legislation.

**Your rights concerning the processing of your data.**
-------------------------------------------------------

In accordance with the terms of the applicable legislation, the user is informed that he/she has the following rights:

* Access: allows the data subject to obtain information about whether or not we are processing personal data concerning him/her and, if so, the right to obtain information about your personal data undergoing processing.
* Rectification: allows you to correct errors and modify data that proves to be inaccurate or incomplete.
* Erasure (‘right to be forgotten’): The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her.
* Restriction of processing: under the legally established conditions, allows data processing to be stopped, in such a way as to prevent its processing in the future, which will only keep it for the exercise or defense of claims.
* Right to object: in certain circumstances and for reasons related to their particular situation, data subjects may oppose the processing of their data. In this case, the data will no longer be processed, except for compelling legitimate reasons, or the exercise or defense of possible claims.
* Data portability: allows the data subject to receive their personal data concerning them, which they have provided to us, and to be able to transmit them directly to another data controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. In order to exercise this right, it will be necessary for the customer to provide a valid e-mail address. Please note that this right only applies to automated information in respect of which the user initially consented to its processing or in the event that the information has been used to enter into a contract with you.

FORVO guarantees the adoption of necessary measures to ensure the exercise of these rights free of charge, being necessary for such exercise to attach a copy of your official identification document in general. However, depending on the complexity of the request, the complete attention/response of certain rights could take a longer period of time, which in any case will not exceed two additional months.

To exercise any of the previously mentioned rights, FORVO users who are interested may contact, easily and free of charge, through the e-mail address [info@forvo.com](mailto: info@forvo.com). As established by law, the exercise of these rights will be dealt with by us within a maximum period of one month.

Finally, the data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with the national supervisory authority that may be applicable. For this purpose, please contact [https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index\_en.htm](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm).

* Hosting services, video-call services, maintenance and support in our databases, as well as in our software and applications that may contain data about you.
