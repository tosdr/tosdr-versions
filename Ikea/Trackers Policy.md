We use them with the intention to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user.

You may change your cookie preferences at our **Privacy Preference Center** [here.](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/react-client/#cookieconsent-show-settings)

Some of the cookies are strictly necessary for the functionality of the site while others are used to enhance the performance and your user experience or to show you advertisements and products that we think will be of interest to you.

**Strictly necessary cookies are used to:**

The cookies are used to improve services for you through, for example:

* Enabling the functionality of some specific services like payment which will not work without those cookies
* Enabling a service to recognize your device so you do not have to give the same information several times during one task
* Recognizing that you may already have given a username and password when logged-in to IKEA Family so you do not need to do it for every web page requested
* Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and to ensure that there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast
* Analyzing data to help us understand how you use online services so we can improve them
