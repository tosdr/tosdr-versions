Privacy Policy
==============

We are “Red Black Tree d.o.o. Čačak“, reg.no. 20857706, a software development company registered at and operating under the laws and legislation of the Republic of Serbia.

This privacy policy will explain how our organization uses the personal data we collect from you when you use our website (“Site”), or when you communicate with us using Internet, or by other means of communication.

Red Black Tree accepts and follows local and international standards and rules regarding personal data collection via it’s corporate website (Site), therefore this Privacy Policy is established to provide you with information on which personal data we are collecting and how, for which purposes, and other details in this regard, and applies to your personal data whichever country you are coming from.

We as a company are legally bound to comply with the jurisdiction of the Republic of Serbia, which has accepted and incorporated EU’s GDPR into it’s legislation, and therefore the actual EU regulation (GDPR). Primarily, your personal data collected via Red Black Tree corporate website are protected under the Law on Personal Data Protection of the Republic of Serbia, which is in harmony with EU’s GDPR ([The Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, number 97/08](https://www.poverenik.rs/images/stories/dokumentacija-nova/zakon-o-zastiti-podataka-o-licnosti_en.pdf)).

Pursuantly, Red Black Tree and this Privacy Policy follows the personal data definition under General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (GDPR): Personal data are any information which are related to an identified or identifiable natural person (Art. 4.1 of GDPR), i.e. any information that can identify an individual, either directly or when combined with other data.

However, we strive to maintain protection of personal data which is also compliant on most territories of North America (that is, USA and Canada) and United Kingdom. We believe that personal data protection established by instruments of GDPR should also suffice, at least in key-elements, when most other worldly legislations are concerned. There are quite a few internationally accepted and valid definitions of “personal data”, although most of them share the same principal elements. For instance, the "Personal Identification Data", as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.

The data subjects are identifiable if they can be directly or indirectly identified, especially by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one of several special characteristics, which expresses the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, commercial, cultural or social identity of these natural persons. In practice, these also include all data which are or can be assigned to a person in any kind of way. For example, the telephone, credit card or personnel number of a person, account data, number plate, appearance, customer number or address are all personal data, also commonly known as personal identifying data, or elsewhere as personal identifying information.

Particularly sensitive information such as health information, income, religion and cultural profiles and the like is also personal data (RBT is not collecting them). Furthermore, and crucial in the present context, data on user behavior is also personal. Cookies can track and register individual users’ browsing activities, like what articles they scroll past and which ones they choose to click on.

In this regard, we are assuring you that our core-business is not based upon, dependent upon or focused on collection of any personal data. We strive to run our business, which is mostly software development, without collection and usage of your personal data.

Therefore, we may get in touch with, or in possession of, your personal data primarily while you are visiting our Site, or while you are communicating with us using email, either as a representative of our current or prospective clients, business partners or other parties interested in our software development business.
