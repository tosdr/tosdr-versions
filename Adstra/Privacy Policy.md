**SCOPE**

This Privacy Policy is primarily intended to provide a description of the ways in which we collect and use information to deliver advertising through direct mail and digitally across the Internet.  Neither the Sites, nor our online activities or services for our clients, are directed toward or intended for children under the age of 18. We do not collect PII from any person of whom we have actual knowledge is under the age of 18. By using our website, the website of any of our publishers in our networks or submitting information to us, you consent to our use and sharing of the information collected or submitted as described in this Privacy Policy.

Please be aware that in addition to our Sites, the websites of our clients and publishers, applications on which we place advertisements and any third party websites linked to one of our Sites, may also collect information from you for various purposes, including, but not limited to, providing advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. Such information collected by such websites and mobile applications and their affiliated or third party partners may include Non-PII through the use of cookies and other technologies. It may also include any PII you choose to provide in registering and transacting with such websites and mobile applications. Although we choose our business partners and clients carefully, Adstra is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites and mobile applications operated by such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of such websites and mobile applications you visit to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.

**WHAT ADSTRA DOES**

Adstra operates a data management business for its clients for terrestrial (e.g., direct mail) and digital advertising technology (the “Technology”) enabling marketers to target advertising based upon our proprietary composite of multiple intent signals of users and to recognize devices that you may use to connect to the Internet such as computers, mobile devices, tablets, smart TVs, game consoles and any other device that enables data collection and exchange (all referred to as “Screens”) for the purpose of sequential targeting, interest-based advertising, cross-screen attribution, and optimization of digital advertising. We help advertisers, advertising networks, online merchants and websites (our “Clients”) do a better job at engaging with their customers and prospects (their “Users”). This Privacy Policy covers the data collected by Adstra’s Technology as well as the information collected on www.adstradata.com (the “Website”).  Adstra is a member of a number of industry associations that govern the policies around online consumer privacy and digital advertising, including the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). We comply with Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) and Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB).

**PRIVACY BY DESIGN**

Our philosophy on privacy follows the framework of Privacy by Design. We integrate privacy in strategy, product development, and more. We can protect consumer privacy AND provide relevant advertising, which benefits everyone involved, especially advertisers, consumers, and small business websites and mobile applications. Ensuring the protection of privacy throughout the entire lifecycle of the data is of the utmost importance, and we are careful to protect privacy as data is collected, used, and destroyed responsibly.

We constantly strive to maintain unparalleled visibility with consumers. We provide transparency and choice through our website, encourage the same practice throughout the Internet, and utilize [AdChoices](http://www.youradchoices.com/) on each banner advertisement and through AppChoices for providing choice and tailoring ads to consumers’ interests.  We respect consumer privacy and give consumers the ability to opt out of interest-based advertising (“IBA”).

**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

We collect information from your use of our Technology. When you visit any website, mobile site, app or other digital media property where our Technology is enabled (“Client Sites”), we may collect information about your interaction with, and the content on, that Client Site. The information collected via the Technology is put into a “snapshot” and is sent to our servers each time a User visits a Client Site. Our servers use the information to create a unique ID for every Screen that our technology is able to recognize within a reasonable probability. Our Technology uses machine learning to perceive common characteristics between multiple Screens (e.g., common IP address) to infer the likelihood that two Screens belong to the same household. By inferring these types of relationships, we can help our Clients understand how Screens might be related so Clients can deliver advertising and content personalized to their Users based on User interests gathered across multiple Screens. Adstra may use non-PII that it has collected or that it obtains from third parties to create data segments and intent profiles, based upon User interactions with our Clients as well as other User behavior, such as the websites visited and mobile applications used by a User.

Adstra licenses the data collected as described herein to third parties in connection with our business, including to our Clients, our partners and other third parties (collectively our “Business Partners”). This shared information may include non-PII information about your particular Screen (e.g., hardware make and model), its operating system, advertising identifiers (such as Apple IDFA or AAID), IP address, carrier identifiers and other connectivity information, browser version, precise geolocation information, and cookies. This information may be categorized to create audience segments with common interests, intent or other characteristics, but does not include PII. We may also share aggregated, non-PII with our Business Partners, such as aggregated reports derived in part from the information we have collected. The information we share may also be combined with third party data to provide an even broader service to our Clients and Business Partners.

We may disclose information collected from the Website and through the Technology we have if we have a good-faith belief that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process or an enforceable government request; to enforce applicable terms of use for our services; to detect, prevent or otherwise address illegal activity, fraud, or security issues; or to protect the property or safety of our users, Adstra, or the public as required or permitted by law. We may also make both PII and non-PII available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are under common ownership or control within the Adstra family.

We may transfer information, including PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If Adstra is involved in any such transaction, you will be notified via prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.

We also provide information to third parties who provide services to Adstra in connection with operating and maintaining the Website and the Technology. These service providers are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for Adstra . In addition, we may share aggregated information with Business Partners and the general public, such as usage statistics or demographic trends regarding how you and others may interact with the Website and/or Technology.

**INFORMATION SECURITY**

The security of your information is important to us. Adstra has implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information, both during transmission and once it is received, including without limitation, use of firewalls, application controls and encryption. No method of electronic storage or transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. So while Adstra strives to use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee complete security. If you have any questions about these security practices, please email us at **privacy.officer@adstradata.com**.

**ADSTRA DOES NOT INTEND TO MARKET TO CHILDREN**

Adstra’s Website and Technology is designed for people 18 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.

**SELF-REGULATION & VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE**

Our industry has a rigorous voluntary self-regulatory regime, and we are active members of industry groups such as the [Interactive Advertising Bureau](http://www.iab.net/) (IAB), [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) (DAA) and [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/) (DAAC) who promulgate codes of conduct to which their members must adhere. These codes impose requirements on participating companies such as transparency and choice around the use of data for IBA and require regular audits of member privacy practices.

Adstra is an active member of these and other groups, and where Adstra engages in activities regulated by these programs, we support the [DAA Self-Regulatory Principles](http://www.aboutads.info/principles) and the [DAAC Self-Regulatory Principles](http://youradchoices.ca/the-principles/).

**YOUR CHOICES**

Adstra wants you to be in control of your experience while interacting with the Website and our Technology. We help our Clients provide you with digital advertising that’s meaningful and supports the Client Sites you use for free, so everyone wins. For more information about online behavioral advertising, please visit the [DAA website](https://youradchoices.com/).

**Adstra Intent Data Collection Web Browser opt-out:** If you’d like to opt-out from web-based targeted advertising from Adstra, please [click here](https://bluecava.com/).  If you’d like to opt-out from online behavioral advertising from any DAA member company, please [click here](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN). When you opt-out, our partners, will drop an opt-out cookie that tells our Technology not to deliver targeted advertising to that particular browser or device. If you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different browser or device, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. **_Please note that you will still see ads if you opt out._** The ads delivered through the Technology will just be less relevant to you. We provide you with meaningful choices regarding opt-outs for data collection, including the opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track (DNT) signals, and we do not control how our Clients respond to DNT.

**Adstra Intent Data Collection Mobile Device opt-out:** We also honor the mobile device settings for Android and Apple iOS devices. To exercise this opt-out, please visit the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). For devices where we are able to see that such a selection has been made, we will not use information collected from that device to deliver targeted advertising.

**Adstra Cross-Device opt-out:** If you’d like to opt-out of cross-device tracking from Adstra we will not share the identity of your device with our Clients for the purpose of enabling online behavioral advertising. Note that we do have some Clients who use our Technology on their own Client Sites, including for things like fraud prevention, which are not subject to opt-out choice.

We may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of the Site and other websites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes.  Among these third parties, we may use Google to improve the performance of the Site and for analytics and marketing purposes.  For more information about how Google Analytics collects and uses data when you use our Site, visit [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

To make a verifiable consumer request please click [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/3d2d5e0c-bd98-46b8-906c-ede68a6f6a80/acba2670-5ad9-46d7-b958-c6612006f7ed).

Verification Process and Required Information. Please note that in order to exercise your rights for information and/or deletion, we may take reasonable steps to verify the identity of a consumer making the request. To prevent the unauthorized access or deletion of personal information, we may request a notarized affidavit verifying a consumer’s identity. We request that our affidavit be notarized and returned to us (as described in instructions that will be provided upon submission request). Adstra will compensate for the reasonable cost of this notarization.

In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the right to know and/or right to deletion, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or if an exception applies.

Authorized Agent. You may designate an authorized agent to make a CCPA request on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests, or a power of attorney. We may also follow up to verify your identity by requesting a notarized affidavit before processing the authorized agent’s request.
