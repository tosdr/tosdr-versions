#### Terms of Service

* * *

PLEASE NOTE: SECTION 17 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH IPAPI. PLEASE READ IT.  
  

1. **Introduction**
    * Welcome to IPAPI ! IPAPI’s services are offered by Kloudend, Inc. ("Kloudend" or the "Company"). Your use of Kloudend’s services, including the services Kloudend makes available through ipapi.co (the "Site"), and any other software or services offered by Kloudend in connection with any of those (the "Services") is governed by these terms of service (the "Terms"), so please carefully read them before using the Services. For the purposes of these Terms, "we," "our," "us," and "IPAPI" refer to Kloudend, the providers and operators of the Services.
    * In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these Terms. If you are registering for or using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will also refer to that organization, wherever possible.
    * You must be over 13 years of age to use the Services, and children under the age of 13 cannot use or register for the Services. If you are over 13 years of age but are not yet of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these Terms and agree to them for you before you use the Services. If you are a parent or guardian and you provide your consent to your child's registration with the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect of your child’s use of the Services.
    * You agree your purchase and/or use of the Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by IPAPI or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.
    * BY USING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS INCLUDED IN OR WITH THE SERVICES, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES.
    * IF YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH IPAPI FOR USE OF SERVICES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SUCH OTHER AGREEMENT SHALL PREVAIL OVER ANY CONFLICTING TERMS OR CONDITIONS IN THESE TERMS.
    * CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SERVICES OR SITE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES, TERMS, OR RULES, WHICH WILL BE POSTED ON THE SERVICE OR SITE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH FEATURES. TO THE EXTENT SUCH TERMS, GUIDELINES, AND RULES CONFLICT WITH THESE TERMS, SUCH TERMS SHALL GOVERN SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH FEATURES. IN ALL OTHER SITUATIONS, THESE TERMS SHALL GOVERN.
2. **Your Account**
    * In the course of registering for or using the Services, you may be required to provide IPAPI with certain information, including your name, contact information, username and password ("Credentials"). IPAPI handles such information with the utmost attention, care and security. Nonetheless, you, not IPAPI, shall be responsible for maintaining and protecting your Credentials in connection with the Services. If your contact information or other information relating to your account changes, you must notify IPAPI promptly and keep such information current. You are solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify IPAPI of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your email or password has been hacked or stolen. If you discover that someone is using your Credentials without your consent, or you discover any other breach of security, you agree to notify IPAPI immediately.
3. **Content**
    * A variety of information and data (including location, timezone, currency, language and other information for IP addresses), blog posts, messages (including email messages), comments, posts, text, graphics, software, photographs, videos, data, reviews, recommendations, and other materials may be made available through the Services by IPAPI or its suppliers ("Content"). While IPAPI strives to keep the Content that it provides through the Services accurate, complete, and up-to-date, IPAPI cannot guarantee, and is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Content. You acknowledge that by using the Services, you may be exposed to materials that are offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will IPAPI be liable in any way for any such Content.
    * You acknowledge that you may also be able to create, transmit, publish or display information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) through use of the Services. All such information is referred to below as "User Content." You agree that you are solely responsible for your User Content, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which IPAPI may suffer) in connection with such User Content. If you are registering for these Services on behalf of an organization, you also agree that you are also responsible for the actions of associated Users and for any User Content that such associated Users might upload, record, publish, post, link to, or otherwise transmit or distribute through use of the Services. IPAPI may refuse to store, provide, or otherwise maintain your User Content for any or no reason. IPAPI may remove your User Content from the Services at any time if you violate these Terms or if the Services are canceled or suspended. If User Content is stored using the Services with an expiration date, IPAPI may also delete the User Content as of that date. User Content that is deleted may be irretrievable. You agree that IPAPI has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any User Content or other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Services. IPAPI reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to monitor and remove User Content from the Services, in its discretion. You agree to immediately take down any User Content that violates these Terms, including pursuant to a takedown request from IPAPI. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from IPAPI to take down certain User Content, IPAPI reserves the right to directly take down such User Content. By submitting, posting or otherwise uploading User Content on or through the Services you give IPAPI a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such User Content for the purpose of enabling IPAPI to provide you with the Services, and for the limited purposes stated in our Privacy Policy.
    * Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you hereby grant IPAPI a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute any queries that you submit through the Services, except with respect to any portion of a query containing personally identifiable information. With respect to any portion of a query containing personally identifiable information, you hereby grant IPAPI a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute the information only to the extent necessary to provide the Services to you.
4. **Proprietary Rights**
    * You acknowledge and agree that IPAPI (or IPAPI’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services and the Content and that the Services and the Content are protected by copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights and laws (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).
    * Except as provided in Section 3, IPAPI acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any User Content that you create, upload, submit, post, transmit, share or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that User Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with IPAPI, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that IPAPI has no obligation to do so on your behalf.
5. **License from IPAPI and Restrictions on Use**
    * IPAPI gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. Under no circumstances are you permitted to resell or license the Content. Your use of the Content is limited to your internal use and the internal use of your Clients. You represent and warrant that prior to sharing Content with your employees, agents, other representatives, or clients, you will enter into written agreements providing that such persons will not use the Content in a manner that conflicts with these Terms. You remain liable for the use of the Content and Services by any person to whom you give access to the foregoing.
    * You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to): (i) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Services or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by IPAPI, in writing (e.g., through an open source software license); or (ii) use the Services to develop a database, a similar service, or other information resource for sale to, distribution to, display to, or use by others; or (iii) store in a retrieval system accessible to the public, transfer, publish, distribute, display to others, broadcast, sell, or sublicense the Services, or any portion thereof; or (iv) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the Services or any applications running on the Services.
    * You may not engage in any activity that interferes with, disrupts, overburdens, or overwhelms the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services). Service may be restricted / limited or throttled beyond fair & reasonable use, as reasonably determined by IPAPI. IPAPI may determine use of the Services to be unreasonable based upon factors including, but not limited to : denial of service, stress testing, technical error, malicious traffic, sudden change in usage pattern, disproportionate or unreasonable surge in request rate.
    * You may not try to access the Services using a method other than the interface and the instructions that are provided by IPAPI.
    * Accuracy of geographic location obtained from an IP address has its limitation. IPAPI cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy of the Services due to factors beyond its control. The Services cannot reliably identify a geographic level or division more precise than the zip code or postal code associated with an IP address. The consistency of the data obtained from the Services varies by geographic region. Accordingly, it is imperative that IPAPI's customers not rely on the Services to identify a specific household, individual, or street address. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF THE SERVICES AND YOU WILL NOT USE OR ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO USE THE SERVICES FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING OR LOCATING A SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLD, INDIVIDUAL, OR STREET ADDRESS.
    * We and / or our partners (third party service providers) may monitor the incoming traffic and use external services to screen and restrict malicious use. It is your responsibility to ensure that devices, IP address, headers and meta information you use to access the Services do not have a malicious reputation or are linked with abusive usage or pose a threat to our system.
    * You may not access the Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding usage limits or quotas.
    * IPAPI is not a consumer reporting agency as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §1681 et seq. ("FCRA"). The Services do not constitute "consumer reports" as defined in the FCRA. You agree that you will not use the Services or any information received through the Services in whole or in part (i) as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for credit, (ii) as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for insurance, (iii) for employment purposes, (iv) in connection with a determination of an individual's eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental authority, or (v) in connection with any permissible purpose as defined by the FCRA. Any use of the Services by you in violation of this paragraph shall also constitute an unacceptable use.
    * You may not access the Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against IPAPI or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Services. You may not use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application or other manual or automatic program or device to retrieve, index, "scrape," "data mine" or in any way gather Content from the Services. You may not use the Services to assemble email lists for the purposes of sending out mass emails or "spam." You may not access the Services for the purpose of collecting Content for sale or resale without the express written consent of IPAPI.
    * You agree that you will not upload, record, publish, post, link to, transmit or distribute User Content, or otherwise utilize the Services in a manner that: (i) advocates, promotes, incites, instructs, informs, assists or otherwise encourages violence or any illegal activities; (ii) infringes or violates the copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights of any third party or IPAPI, or any rights of publicity or privacy of any party; (iii) attempts to mislead others about your identity or the origin of a message or other communication, or impersonates or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with any other person or entity, or is otherwise materially false, misleading, or inaccurate; (iv) promotes, solicits or comprises inappropriate, harassing, abusive, profane, hateful, defamatory, libelous, threatening, obscene, indecent, vulgar, pornographic or otherwise objectionable or unlawful content or activity; (v) is harmful to minors; (vi) utilizes or contains any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, or any other similar software, data, or programs that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, data, personal information, or property of another; or (vii) violates any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation (including without limitation the laws and regulations governing export control, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, or false advertising).
    * You may not use the Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Services are not intended for children under 13.

You should immediately notify IPAPI of any unauthorized use of your API Key.
    * You are solely responsible and liable for the Developer App. You are solely responsible for supporting the Developer App. The Developer App must comply with the following (the "App Policy"): the Developer App may not (i) violate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) violate any laws or regulations (including any privacy laws) or any obligations or restrictions imposed by any third party; (iii) be unlawful, harassing, abusive, tortious, threatening, harmful, invasive of another's privacy, vulgar, defamatory, false, intentionally misleading, trade libelous, pornographic, obscene, or patently offensive, or promote racism, bigotry, hatred, or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual, or be otherwise objectionable; (iv) be harmful to minors in any way; (v) contain any computer viruses, worms, or any software intended to damage or alter a computer system or data; (vi) send unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of duplicative or unsolicited messages, whether commercial or otherwise.

The foregoing restrictions on disclosure shall not apply to Confidential Information that is (a) already known by you; (b) becomes, through no act or fault of yours, publicly known; (c) received by you from a third party without a restriction on disclosure or use; or (d) independently developed by you without reference to IPAPI's Confidential Information.

    * These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and Pricing Terms, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Services and all related activities. These Terms shall not be modified except in writing signed by both parties or by a new posting of these Terms issued by us. If any part of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part shall be deemed severed and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

    * These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services, including the formation, interpretation, breach or termination thereof, including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable, will be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS International Arbitration Rules. The tribunal will consist of a sole arbitrator. The seat of the arbitration will be San Francisco, California. If for any reason it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that San Francisco, California cannot be the seat of the arbitration, the arbitration will take place in London, United Kingdom. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the reasonable costs for legal representation incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. If the arbitrator(s) determine a party to be the prevailing party under the circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of its claims and counterclaims, the arbitrator(s) may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the reasonable costs for legal representation incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND IPAPI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION (INCLUDING A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION). Unless both you and IPAPI agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
