1\. Scope of Privacy Policy; Changes to Policy
----------------------------------------------

This Privacy Policy applies to all aspects of our Site as well as to information we may collect offline.

This Site may link to or incorporate websites or content hosted and served by others over which we have no control, such as third party websites, online properties, platforms, social media, or systems, which are each governed by the privacy policy and business practices of the third party.

2\. Information We Collect
--------------------------

We collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit the Site, and sometimes from third parties. Some of this information may be considered "personal information" under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name, telephone number, and e-mail address), as well as additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, where required by applicable law. And, if we combine information that we consider to be non-personal with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. In the limited circumstances in which we may process sensitive personal information as defined by applicable law, we process such information as permitted by and in compliance with applicable law. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or transforming it into information that does not identify you. We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

1. ‍**Information You Provide**  
    Cameo may collect personal information from you when you:

1. Create an Account on, Login to, or Interact with the Site. Cameo may collect your name and email address and other information that you provide, such as a telephone number, when you register or login, update, or add information or content to your account. We may require you to create a username and password if you create an account, or we may enable other methods such as logging in through one of your existing social media accounts such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (collectively, "Social Media Platforms") or your Apple ID. Cameo also collects certain information relating to any Social Media Platform account or Apple ID that you use to login to or link to your Cameo account (such as your username, bio, and number of followers), although linking any such account to your Cameo account or logging into Cameo via such account is entirely up to you. We may store payment information (such as credit or debit card details) for future purchases on your account. If you create an account using a Cameo-provided referral link or code through one of our referral programs, or by clicking on an ad that takes you to our Site, we may also receive certain information about you based on your use of or interaction with the link, code, or ad.
2. Make a Purchase through the Site. Cameo collects the information that you provide when you request a Cameo Video or other offering, including, for example and as applicable, your name and email address, any mobile telephone contact number (of you or the recipient) you choose to provide, the name of the person or entity giving and receiving the purchase, and the details that you provide as part of your request. When you purchase merchandise, we also collect shipping and delivery information. Cameo processes payment information you provide when you pay for a purchase. We collect information of the recipients that you provide to us to the extent necessary to provide the Cameo offering, either as part of the content or for the transaction itself (for example, we share the recipient’s name and the details of the request with the applicable Cameo "Talent User") or to deliver merchandise.
3. Participate in Sweepstakes, Contests, or Other Promotional Activities. Cameo collects the information that you provide when you enter a sweepstakes, contest, or promotional activities (each, a "Promotion") through our Site. Each Promotion has its own terms and conditions or official rules, which you should review as they may contain other requirements (such as, allowing use of your name or likeness in advertising unless prohibited by applicable law).
4. Contact Us. Cameo collects the information that you provide in connection with you contacting us, for example when you email our customer service team or fill out a form for us to contact you.
5. Provide Content to the Site. We collect information when you submit content to us, such as a video, review, photo, email, text, social media post, or other communication (each, a "Submission") and, if you are a Talent User, when you submit "Talent Content". Each Submission, whether submitted to our Site directly or through a social media platform, and all Talent Content, is subject to the applicable [Terms of Service](https://www.cameo.com/termsofservice). As a result, others may access it, use it, and share it in accordance with the Terms of Service.
6. Sync Contacts or Connect with Friends. If you choose to upload, sync, or import the contact information of your contacts from your device (such as your address book), or otherwise share such contact information with us, we will collect and store that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You represent that you have obtained the consent of your contacts to share this information with us. We may use this information to identify which of your contacts are users of the Site, to provide services to you, to help you find and connect with people you know, help others find and connect with you, and to customize the content we present to you and to other Site users.
7. Use Social Media with the Site. We collect information when you interact with our Site through any social media platform. For example, we may enable you to use certain of your existing social media platform accounts to create an account on our Site or "like" or "share" content from our Site. Doing so may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you. Some of your information, such as your username, may be publicly displayed. We may also receive information about you if other users of a social media platform give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or "friends". In addition, we and the social media platform may have access to information about you and your use of our Site and the social media platform. The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information that any third party collects is subject to its privacy practices (including whether it shares information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices about what may be visible to others).
8. Use the Site as a Talent User. When you use our Site to become or as a Talent User, we collect, in addition to information provided when you create your account, your name, email address, telephone number, and the social media usernames you provide, Cameo Videos and other offerings prepared by you, and other information relating to our relationship with you, such as payment or identity information. Cameo’s payments to you are made through the third party payment provider selected by Cameo. You should review the payment provider’s privacy policy before providing your personal information, as it is responsible for personal information (as a data controller if you’re in the UK or EEA) in its own right, and its privacy practices may vary from ours.
9. Become a Cameo Partner. When you become a "Cameo Partner" including through our Site, in addition to information you provide if you create an account on the Site, we collect your name, email address, telephone number, and other information relating to our relationship with you, including payment or identity information. Cameo’s payments to you are made through the third party payment provider selected by Cameo. You should review the payment provider’s privacy policy before providing your personal information, as it is responsible for personal information (as a data controller if you’re in the UK or EEA) in its own right, and its privacy practices may vary from ours.
10. Apply for a Job with Cameo. We collect the information you provide when you apply for a job with us (for example, through the "Jobs" link on our Site) or directly; this may include your name, contact information, employment history, educational background, any self-identifying information (such as veteran status, gender, and ethnicity) and other information you provide. More details can be found in our [Applicant and Candidate Privacy Policy](https://careers.cameo.com/applicant-and-candidate-privacy-policy), and in the case of any conflict between that policy and this one, the Applicant and Candidate Privacy Policy shall apply. Please note that your use of a third party tool or third-party applicant tracking system utilized by Cameo (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) to apply is subject to the third party’s privacy policy.

2. **Information from Third Parties**  
    We may also obtain information, such as contact details (for example, name and email address), country, IP address, purchase histories, marketing preferences, cookie information, hardware and software information and other technical information about you from third parties, such as other users of the Site who upload information or sync their contacts, analytics companies, social media platforms, and other third party business partners, such as a Cameo Partner. For example, if you discuss becoming a Talent User through a Cameo Partner, we may collect your name, email address, telephone number, and the social media usernames you provide relating to that relationship from the Cameo Partner.  
      
    We and our third party business partners may collect information about your visits to and activity on our Site and other websites and services. We may combine that information with other personal information we have collected from or about you. We may share certain of this information with third party business partners for similar purposes as described below.

-------------------------------------

1. ‍**Cookies and Tracking**  
    When you visit our Site or otherwise interact with us or our content, we and third-party advertising and analytics companies and other third party business partners may use a variety of tracking and other technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information ("Usage Information").  
      
    We and third parties may use these technologies for a number of reasons, including to save your preferences for future visits, to our Site, keep you logged in between visits, to serve targeted advertising to you, and to provide you with improved services. If you sign up for our text messaging program, cookies may also be used to personalize your experience (e.g. send you personalized text messages such as shopping cart reminders). The information collected by us and the third parties we work with may include (but is not limited to):

* date and time of your visit to our Site;

* whether an email message we sent was opened and whether a link in the email message was clicked.

2. ‍**Methods We Use to Collect**  
    The methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:

* Cookies and Local Storage. A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Site or otherwise access our content. Certain web browsers and certain browser add-ons, such as Adobe Flash, may provide additional local data storage mechanisms that are used in a manner similar to cookies, and some of the content included on our Site may make use of this local storage. To get information about Flash and Adobe’s privacy choices from Adobe, [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html).

Some cookies are essential to the functioning of the Site, and, without them, some features and services you have requested cannot be provided. If you disable cookies, adjust privacy settings on your device, restrict local storage, or otherwise limit these technologies, you may not be able to use some of our Site features.
* Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "pixels", "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web pages and email messages. Web beacons may not be visible to you. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many email messages we sent were opened, and to count whether a link in an email message we sent was clicked.
* Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on.

* Other Technologies. We may also use other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.

3. **"Do Not Track" Signals**  
    Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many websites and online services, Cameo does not currently alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor’s browser except as required by law.

* We will disclose your personal information when necessary to exercise, enforce, establish, or defend our legal rights. For example, we may review your account information in order to investigate allegations of hacking or a breach of the applicable [Terms of Service](https://www.cameo.com/termsofservice).

2. Exercising Your Access, Deletion, Do-Not-Sell, Do-Not-Share, and Similar Rights.

1. Rights. Your rights may include the right to ask us: to let you know and access the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you over the last 12 months, to correct or delete Personal Information we have collected about you, and to opt-out of the sharing or sale of Personal Information, all subject to some limits. You are not required to create an account to make a request; more information on each of these rights is set out below. 
2. Authorized Agent. If you are an agent submitting a request on a consumer’s behalf, please have them complete, date, and sign the Verification of Identity and Designation of Authorized Agent form at [this link](https://cdn.cameo.com/static/legal/Cameo+-+Verification+of+Identity+and+Designation+of+Authorized+Agent.pdf) and send a copy, by email to [dataprotection@cameo.com](mailto:dataprotection@cameo.com). Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney. In either case, please also indicate in your email the nature of your request. The consumer’s identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm to us that they gave you permission to submit the request. Keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that an agent is authorized to act on a consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request.

3. Response Timing. We typically process: an access or deletion request within 45 days from the day we receive it (and will notify you within that period if we need more time); and an opt-out of sale or sharing request within 15 business days from the day we receive it.
4. Request to Know/Access or Request to Correct or Delete.

1. Making A Request. If you would like to request information about the Personal Information we have collected about you over the last 12 months or to request that we correct or delete your information, you (or an authorized agent) may submit your request, along with the first and last name of the subject of the request, the email address used to interact with Cameo, and confirmation of your jurisdiction of residency by either: (1) sending an email to [dataprotection@cameo.com](mailto:dataprotection@cameo.com); or (2) calling us toll-free at [1-800-243-1739](tel:1-800-243-1739).
2. Verifying A Request. We will use the information you provide to verify your request and may request additional information if needed. If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request. If we decline to process your request, you may appeal by contacting us at the email address or phone number above within a reasonable time after your request is declined; your appeal must include sufficient information for us to identify your original request and any information or reasons you wish us to consider upon appeal.
3. Other Important Information.

1. Request to Know/Access. You (or an authorized agent) must provide us with enough information to verify your identity. In order to provide specific pieces of information, we require a declaration, signed under penalty of perjury, stating that you are the subject of the request (or an authorized agent). If we are unable to verify that you are the subject of the request (or an authorized agent), we will not provide the information requested.
2. Request to Delete. In addition, if you have a Site account, you may [Contact Us](https://legal.cameo.com/privacypolicy#contact-us) to submit your request or do so through the account services portal in our mobile application.
