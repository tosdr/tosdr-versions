### 1\. CAMEO Marketplace

By creating an account on our Site, you agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information. You agree not to create a Site account using a false identity or providing false information or if you have previously been removed or banned from our Site. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Site account information, including your username and password. You are responsible for all activities that occur on or in connection with your Site account and you agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or use of your Site account. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for any damages, losses, costs, expenses, or liabilities related to any unauthorized access to or use of your Site account.

[↑ Return to Top](#top)

### 2\. CAMEO Videos

1. Through our Site, you may obtain personalized videos (“CAMEO Videos”) from celebrities, including athletes, actors, performers, artists, influencers, and others (each, a “Talent User”). You may submit a request to a Talent User for a CAMEO Video that is personalized for you or a third-party that you identify as a recipient (“Recipient”).
2.  You acknowledge and agree that the Talent User has sole discretion to determine how to fulfill your request and the content of the CAMEO Video created, and may not follow your request exactly. We reserve the right to reject any request in our sole discretion. The Talent User has up to seven days or longer (at our sole discretion) to fulfill or decline your request. Talent Users may offer the option to request a CAMEO Video for fulfillment within a shorter timeframe, such as 24 hours. If such a request is not fulfilled within the described timeframe, Cameo may in its sole discretion either (i) issue a refund or credit for the entire booking or (ii) convert the booking to a standard CAMEO Video request and issue a refund or credit for the difference in cost between the original booking and the cost of a standard CAMEO Video request for the Talent User. Refunds or credits associated with such bookings will be handled as described in Section 7 (Fees and Payment).
3. CAMEO Videos are licensed, not sold. You are buying the right (or license) to use it, not the actual CAMEO Video itself.
4. Subject to these Terms and to your payment in full, the Talent User hereby grants to you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, sublicensable, revocable license to use, reproduce, distribute, and publicly display the CAMEO Video (other than a Business CAMEO Video) in any and all media (for example, on social media platforms), whether now known or hereafter invented or devised, (i) **for your own personal, non-commercial, and non-promotional purposes** and (ii) at personal or commercial events of up to 1000 people, **provided that the CAMEO Video does not contain any promotion or endorsement of a Business (as defined below) or of any products or services**.
5. You may not sell, resell, commercialize, or encumber your rights in any Cameo Offering, including creating a non-fungible token (“NFT”) from any Cameo Offering except as agreed by Cameo in advance in writing. You may sublicense your rights in a CAMEO Video only to the extent necessary for you to use the CAMEO Video as permitted under these Terms (for example, sharing it (if it is not a Business CAMEO Video) with friends on a social media platform or sending it to a Recipient for personal, non-commercial, and non-promotional purposes as set forth above).
6. You may use a CAMEO Video only in accordance with these Terms, which includes our [Acceptable Use Policy](#acceptable-use) / [Community Guidelines](https://www.cameo.com/communityguidelines). We may terminate all or part of the foregoing licenses at any time for any reason. We reserve the right to remove a CAMEO Video from our Site at any time for any reason without any notice to you.

### 3\. Business CAMEO Videos

1. Some Talent Users may offer CAMEO Videos for the promotion and/or endorsement of a product, service, brand, or business of a single lawfully registered and operating commercial business, not-for-profit, or governmental entity (each, a "Business"), or for Business communications, such as employee recognition or a company-wide meeting, conducted and operated by the Business with greater than 1000 attendees and/or viewers (each, a "Business CAMEO Video"). Except as noted, each Business CAMEO Video is a CAMEO Video under these Terms. When you submit a request for a Business CAMEO Video, you must specifically identify the Business, the types of goods or services that it offers, as well as the specific product, service, or brand that you request the Talent User to mention or refer to, and any other requested information. Absent Cameo's prior written approval, any resulting Business CAMEO Video must be in English.
2. Subject to these Terms, including the limitations set forth in Section 3.b.iii, and to your payment in full, the Talent User hereby grants to you the following limited rights to use the Business CAMEO Video **solely for the reasonable promotional purposes of the Business**:

* starting on the date the Business CAMEO Video is downloaded by you from the Site or otherwise provided to you, and until the earlier of (A) the date the Business CAMEO Video is first used, reproduced, distributed, or publicly displayed by you or the Business in one of the manners set forth in Section 3.b.ii below and (B) 60 days after the date that Cameo notified you that the Business CAMEO Video was completed (such period, the “C4B Preparation Period”), an exclusive (except as to the license granted to Cameo), royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, sublicensable, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, and create derivative works of the Business CAMEO Video solely in order to enable the exercise of the rights set forth in Section 3.b.ii; and
* starting on the conclusion of the C4B Preparation Period and until 15 days thereafter or such other length of time agreed upon separately between you and Cameo (including in the Site's business booking flow), an exclusive (except as to the license granted to Cameo), royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, sublicensable, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works, and publicly display the Business CAMEO Video only on or in an unlimited number of (A) social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube or Twitter, on accounts wholly owned, operated, and controlled by the Business (each, a “Business Social Media Account”), along with the right to advertise and promote the display of the Business CAMEO Video on the Business Social Media Account through advertising on such social media platform, (B) websites, landing pages, mobile applications owned, operated, and controlled by the Business, communications sent through Business-operated and -controlled channels of communication (such as email blasts or text messages to customers or company emails or meetings), and other similar channels owned, operated, and controlled by the Business and approved in advance by Cameo in writing, and (C) online platforms, display networks, and in-app advertising, including through digital demand side platform or advertising network accounts, but specifically excluding, in all cases, television, over the top (OTT), connected television (CTV), Out Of Home (OOH) and similar streaming media. You may sublicense your rights in a Business CAMEO Video only to the extent necessary for you or the Business on whose behalf you are acting to use the Business CAMEO Video as permitted under these Terms (for example, posting it on a website or Business Social Media Account as set forth in this section 3.b, or as an agency sublicensing to your Business client). Your right to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, edit, and create derivative works of the Business CAMEO Video is conditioned on (A) the resulting work and its use complying with these Terms and continuing to display, fully intact, unobscured, and unaltered, the watermark from the original Business CAMEO Video (including retaining the same size, form, location, and length of time displayed); (B) the resulting work and its use not altering, misrepresenting, or omitting in any way the substantive message of the original Business CAMEO Video or any portion thereof, including any endorsement contained therein; and (C) you having all rights necessary to include any other elements incorporated into the resulting work, including any intellectual property rights, privacy rights, and rights of publicity. To the extent that a work requires the licenses and rights to multiple Business CAMEO Videos, your license and rights to the resulting work will correspond to the most limited of those required licenses and rights. Cameo has the sole discretion in determining compliance with the requirements of this Section.

3. At the end of the license period, you are not required to archive or delete organic, authorized posts made on a Business Social Media Account, provided that you do not, nor will you authorize or encourage any third-party to, pin, repost, link-to, boost with paid spend, or otherwise promote any such organic post containing the Business CAMEO Video in any manner or re-order such organic post in a non-chronological manner. All other retention, use, reproduction, distribution and display of the Business CAMEO Video must end entirely and immediately upon completion of the license period. No other use is authorized under these Terms. To request other uses (for example, additional time, use on additional channels, the ability to use a Business name or logo as a sole watermark), contact us at business@cameo.com.

4. Business CAMEO Video Representations and Warranties: You represent and warrant that:

* the Business is lawfully registered and operating;
* any information provided to the Talent User is factually correct and not misleading and is not disparaging or defamatory;
* you and the Business will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including those that may require adding an appropriate hashtag (including, for example, #ad, #sponsored) or other disclosure in connection with the use of the Business CAMEO Video to identify it as a commercial endorsement, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission publication “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising” and any similar requirements that may be applicable; and
* if and to the extent you are a party to any collective bargaining agreement (a "CBA") with any union or guild, including but not limited to the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ("SAG-AFTRA"), (A) you shall comply with, and as between you and Cameo shall be solely responsible for complying with, such CBA, and (B) Cameo shall not be added as a party to any proceeding with any such union or guild, including SAG-AFTRA, and/or the Talent User without its express written consent but may intercede in its discretion; and
* you have all rights necessary (including from the Business) to request a Business CAMEO Video on behalf of the Business, to agree to these Terms on behalf of the Business, and to request and use the Business CAMEO Video as authorized in these Terms, including all rights necessary to use any information, Business name, trademark, trade name, trade dress, or logos provided in connection with your Submission.

5. Indemnification: In connection with any Business CAMEO Video or other Cameo for Business services you purchase from a Talent User, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the applicable Talent User from and against any and all claims, costs, proceedings, demands, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) of any kind or nature arising from any third-party claim in connection with or relating to: (i) your Submissions; (ii) your breach of these Terms; (iii) your use of the Business CAMEO Video in connection with any other elements, materials, copyrights, rights of publicity, or copyrighted materials other than the Business CAMEO Video provided by the Talent User; or (iv) the sale, license, supply or provision of your goods or services or any other operations of the Business (including, without limitation, personal injury, death, or product liability suits and claims).
6. The Talent User is an intended third-party beneficiary of Sections 3.d. and e. of these Terms, with full power and authority to enforce, in Talent’s own name, any rights granted to it or Cameo pursuant to such Sections.

### 7\. Fees and Payment

1. Fees: The fee for a CAMEO Video or other offering is specified on the Talent User’s booking page on our Site when you make your request. You agree to pay all amounts due in accordance with the payment terms in effect when you submit your request or purchase merchandise, including any applicable service, transaction, or processing fees.
2. Currency: Transactions are settled in U.S. dollars (“USD”). You will be responsible for payment of any fees or expenses imposed by your payment card provider or the payment processor to settle the transaction in USD. From time to time, Cameo may settle transactions in a currency other than USD to reduce or eliminate the fees and expenses associated with currency conversion.
3. Payment: You may request a CAMEO Video by using a valid payment card through the applicable third-party payment provider (for our apps for iOS, and Android, Apple and Android’s in-app payment mechanisms; for our website, the payment provider we select). You must provide the third-party payment provider with valid payment information (Visa, MasterCard, or other issuer accepted by the payment provider). You acknowledge and agree that Cameo does not operate, own, or control the payment provider. Your use of your payment card is governed by your agreement with and the privacy policy of the payment provider, not these Terms. You agree to immediately notify the payment provider of any change in your billing address (or other information) for your payment card. You may not return or exchange a CAMEO Video and no refunds will be issued.

* App for iOS: You will be charged at the time of booking or purchase for all amounts associated with your transaction. If your CAMEO Video request is canceled or not fulfilled, your Cameo account will be issued a credit (in USD only) for the value of your purchase. If you prefer a refund instead, you can request one via Apple by going to your orders in the App for iOS and clicking “request refund” on the Cameo video order; you must have a credit balance at least equal to the refund amount, and credits in such amount will be deducted from your account immediately. By making a purchase on the App for iOS, you represent that you are a resident of a country or territory in which payment in the local currency is supported by the App (as listed here). If you are a resident of a country or territory in which payment in the local currency is not supported by the App for iOS (or located in a country or territory in which payment in the local currency is not supported by the App for iOS), your purchase will not be permitted; however, if such purchase is permitted, Cameo reserves the right to cancel your request and no refund will be issued. The countries and territories and respective local currencies supported by the App for iOS are determined by Apple and not by Cameo and are subject to change at any time.
* App for Android: You will be charged at the time of booking or purchase for all amounts associated with your transaction. If your CAMEO Video request is canceled or not fulfilled, your payment instrument will be refunded.  
    
* Website: By providing your payment information, you agree that Cameo may place a pre-authorization hold and, after your request has been fulfilled, authorize the payment provider to immediately charge you for all amounts due and payable with no additional notice to or consent from you.
* Credits are maintained in your Cameo account. When you make a purchase on the App for iOS or Android, if your account has a credit balance that equals or exceeds the purchase price, the balance will be redeemed for that purchase. When you make a purchase on our website, if your account has a credit balance, you may choose to redeem the balance for the purchase price up to the full balance amount (you will be charged for any remaining portion of the price). Credit balances are not refundable, cannot be transferred, cannot be used outside of Cameo, and expire or extinguish immediately when redeemed.
* In addition, if the CAMEO Video or other offering permits, you may choose to designate an additional amount as a “tip”. You acknowledge that Cameo does not mandate any such tip or gratuity; however, if you do choose to do so, the amount must be at least US $5.00. You agree to pay any amount you authorize as a tip; a tip is not refundable.

4. Cameo reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to cancel your request for any CAMEO Video or other offering if: (i) your payment method is declined; or (ii) you have previously been banned or removed from our Site for any reason. Cameo also reserves the right at any time to change its fees and payment procedures, including its payment options and terms, either immediately upon posting on our Site or by other notice to you.
5. Portion of Payment to Talent: Any payment for a CAMEO Video or any other offering, feature, or service on our Site, such as a tip, Direct Message, or sticker, will be divided between Cameo and Talent as provided for in [Section 4.b](#talent-fees-payment) of the [Talent Terms of Service](#talent-terms).
6. Payment Questions: If you have a question about a purchase made on the App or a charge to your payment card, please contact us at [hello@cameo.com](mailto:hello@cameo.com). We have the sole discretion to determine how billing disputes between us will be resolved.
7. Taxes: If your purchase obligates Cameo to collect a sales tax, use tax, or any other equivalent tax (“Sales Tax”) from you, Cameo will collect Sales Tax in addition to the fee for your purchase. If you have not remitted applicable Sales Tax to Cameo, you will be responsible for the payment of the Sales Tax (and any related penalties or interest) to the appropriate tax authority and you will indemnify Cameo for any liability or expense Cameo may incur in connection with the payment of Sales Taxes on your purchases. At Cameo’s request, you will provide reasonable assistance and documentation relating to the payment of Sale Taxes on your purchases from Cameo (for example, official receipts issued by the appropriate tax authority confirming that you have paid all applicable taxes).

### **CAMEO CUSTOMER REFERRAL PROGRAM**‍

Last Updated: April 13, 2020

These Additional Terms (which are Additional Terms as described in [Section 5](#additional-site-terms) of the Site Terms of Service (“Site Terms”) govern your use of the Customer Referral Program (defined below). “You” and “User” refers to you as a user of the Site and of the Customer Referral Program.

* We provide each User who has created a Site account with a unique referral URL (“URL”) that may be shared with the User’s friends, family members, or other personal contacts and used by them when they create a User Site account for the first time, pursuant to the terms set out below (“Customer Referral Program”).
* Participation in the Customer Referral Program is limited to: (a) each User; and (b) User’s friends, family members, or personal contacts who have never either: (i) purchased a Cameo Video, DM, or Sticker (even without creating a Site account); or(ii) created a Site account. Employees, officers, directors, contractors, agents, and representatives of Cameo may not participate.
* For each eligible friend, family member, or personal contact who creates a User Site account for the first time using your URL (each, a “Referred User”), Cameo will issue a one-time credit or promotional code to the Referred User and, after the Referred User’s first purchase of a Cameo Video priced at the minimum amount specified or more, to you (each, a “Customer Referral Credit”) as described below:

* After the Referred User creates a Site account, Cameo will issue a Customer Referral Credit to the Referred User’s Site account (in approximately one or two business days); and
* After the Referred User makes their first request on the Site for a Cameo Video priced at the minimum amount specified or more (a Cameo Video only; not a Cameo Direct, Sticker, or merchandise) and that request is paid for and fulfilled (excluding any Cameo Video for which a promo code was used and, at Cameo’s discretion, that was subject to a promotion), Cameo will issue a Customer Referral Credit for that Referred User to the referring User’s (your) account (in approximately one or two business days from the date on which the request for the Cameo video was fulfilled).

4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Additional Terms, you acknowledge and agree that:

* a new User will not be one of your Referred Users under the Customer Referral Program and no Customer Referral Credit will be due to that new User or you if:

* your URL is not used when a new User creates a new Site account;
* your friend, family member, or personal contact has previously either purchased a Cameo Video, DM, or Sticker (with or without creating a Site account) or created a Site account, (with or without another URL), whether or not, in either case, under the same or different name or email address, or otherwise; or
* anyone else has received or is receiving a Customer Referral Credit in connection with that friend, family member, or personal contact.  
    

2. each new User may have only one referring User, and we are not obligated to pay more than one Customer Referral Credit to each Referred User for creation of a Site account or to pay a Customer Referral Credit to more than one referring User with respect to any Referred User.

5. Any Customer Referral Credit received from Cameo will be maintained in your Site account and may be redeemed only for your purchase of a Cameo Video, DM, or Sticker (not Cameo merchandise) from our Site. If your Site account has a credit balance when you make a purchase while logged into your Site account, the balance will be redeemed for that purchase (until fully redeemed) and your payment card will be charged for any remaining portion of the purchase price; any remaining balance will remain in your Site account to be redeemed for your next purchase. If you have a credit balance in your Site account, you may not use a promo code and, at Cameo’s discretion, might not be able to participate in an offering that is subject to a promotion. A credit balance is not refundable, may not be redeemed for cash, cannot be transferred, cannot be used outside of the Site, and expires or extinguishes immediately when redeemed.
6. The Customer Referral Program may be used only for personal purposes and you may share your URL only with your personal connections. You may not advertise your URL or share it with anyone other than your friends, family, or other personal contacts. The Customer Referral Program cannot be used for any commercial purpose, including affiliate lead generation. The Customer Referral Program is void where prohibited by law.
7. You represent and warrant that when you share your URL with your personal connections, you will: (a) distribute it in a personal manner; (b) not distribute it in a bulk manner; and (c) not create or send any unsolicited commercial email or a “spam” message under any applicable law or regulation. Any sharing that does not meet these requirements is expressly prohibited and constitutes grounds for immediate termination of your Site account, including deletion of any Customer Referral Credits, and your participation in the Customer Referral Program. Any Site account created using a URL that was distributed through an unauthorized channel will not be valid and any Customer Referral Fees issued in connection with that Site account may be revoked.
8. We reserve the right to deactivate your Site account and any Referred User’s Site account, cancel all related Customer Referral Credits, and seek repayment, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that either you or the Referred User has: (a) tampered with the Customer Referral Program; (b) used (or attempted to use) the Customer Referral Program in a fraudulent, abusive, unethical, unsportsmanlike, or otherwise questionable or suspicious manner; (c) breached any of these Additional Terms; or (d) violated any law or regulation or infringed or violated the rights of any third party.
9. Credits do not expire, but the terms of the Customer Referral Program are subject to change at any time, for any reason, in our sole discretion. Cameo reserves, at any time, for any reason, in its sole discretion to:

* suspend or terminate the Customer Referral Program;
* disqualify anyone from participating in the Customer Referral Program; and
* revoke, refuse to issue, or refuse to redeem any Customer Referral Credits that we suspect were generated through improper channels or in violation of these Additional Terms.

Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to review and investigate activities undertaken in connection with the Customer Referral Program and suspend your Site account, revoke all Customer Referral Fees, or take other action in our sole discretion.

10. By participating in the Customer Referral Program, you agree to release and hold harmless Cameo Parties from and against any and all economic liabilities, claims, damages, loss, harm, costs, or expenses, including property damage, that arise from or relate in any way to the Customer Referral Program. THIS SECTION 10 APPLIES ONLY TO ECONOMIC DAMAGES AND DOES NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS OF FRAUD OR PERSONAL INJURY.

### **CAMEO GIFT CARDS**

Last Updated: February 24, 2021

‍

* **Cameo Gift Cards  
    ‍**These Additional Terms apply to only closed loop prepaid cards (each, a “Gift Card”) issued in electronic form by Cameo Gifts, LLC, a Virginia limited liability company (“Issuer”), that are purchased by customers for use under [Section 5](#gift-cards) (Redemption). These Additional Terms do not apply to any other gift cards that may be issued or provided by Issuer, Baron App, Inc., or their respective affiliates, including at no charge, as a coupon, or as a promotion. As used in these Additional Terms, “Cameo” refers to Baron App, Inc. and its affiliates, including Issuer.
* **Purchase of Gift Cards  
    ‍**A Gift Card is valid only if purchased from Issuer online at [www.cameo.com/giftcards](https://www.cameo.com/giftcards) (“Gift Card Site”) or from a party authorized by Issuer. Cameo is not responsible for, and will not honor, any invalid Gift Card or balance that is incorrect, misrepresented, or invalid based on its Gift Card records.
* **Gift Card Amount Limitations  
    ‍**A customer may purchase a Gift Card with an opening balance between USD $10 and USD $500 as permitted on the Gift Card Site. A customer may not purchase multiple Gift Cards from Issuer in any single day in an aggregate amount over USD $10,000.
* **Delivery and Activation**

* Delivery. All Gift Cards are electronic (as opposed to physical gift cards) and are delivered only by email; no shipping or processing fees apply. A Gift Card has no balance or value until payment has been received and the recipient activates the Gift Card (as described below). Cameo is not responsible for any Gift Card that is undeliverable, not received or not activated, for any reason, including inaccurate delivery information (such as an inaccurate email address), spam filters on the recipient’s email, or otherwise.
* Activation. A Gift Card is activated only after the recipient (who must have or create an account with Cameo) completes the steps online at [www.cameo.com/giftcards/redeem](https://www.cameo.com/giftcards/redeem).

5. **Redemption  
    **A Gift Card may only be activated and redeemed for Cameo credits online at [www.cameo.com/giftcards/redeem](#).

* Applicable Cameo Offerings. Once redeemed for credits, Gift Card funds may be used on the Site to purchase Cameo Videos (including Business Cameo Videos), Cameo DMs, Cameo Stickers, and any other Cameo Offerings identified by Cameo in writing. Credits may not be used for any other Cameo Offering, including Political Cameo Products, Subscriptions, or tips to a Talent User. Cameo credits and the balance or value on a Gift Card cannot be used to purchase another Gift Card.
* Balance. Credit balances will be maintained and applied towards the price of transactions as described in [Section 7 (Fees and Payment)](https://legal.cameo.com/termsofservice#fees-payment) of the Site Terms. When a Gift Card is redeemed for credits, the Gift Card will be deactivated and of no value (unless cash redemption is required by law).
* Not Reloadable. A Gift Card cannot be reloaded, meaning funds may not be added to a Gift Card after it has been purchased.
* Refusal to Accept. Cameo may refuse to accept payment by a Gift Card if Cameo determines that the Gift Card: has an invalid number; has a balance or value of zero; has not been activated; would result in a credit balance in excess of USD $2000 on a Cameo account; or cannot be found within the Cameo’s system. Cameo may also refuse to accept payment by a Gift Card if it suspects fraud, mistake, alteration, error in denomination, or a violation of any applicable law or regulation, its Terms, or these Additional Terms.

6. **No Implied Warranties  
    **A Gift Card is not a credit, debit, or a charge card. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Cameo disclaims all warranties, conditions, and representations of any kind with respect to any Gift Card or the balance of any Gift Card, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including those related to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in the event a valid Gift Card is non- functional, the sole remedy, and the sole liability of Issuer will be the replacement of that Gift Card.
7. **Other Terms  
    **

* No Expiration. While a Gift Card and its balance do not expire, the Gift Card will be deactivated when the balance is reduced to zero. Cameo does not guarantee that Gift Cards or their value will be available at all times or at any given time. Cameo does not guarantee that we will continue to offer Gift Cards for any particular length of time. Cameo may suspend or terminate Gift Cards from time to time for any or no reason, in our sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability.
* Nonrefundable; Not for Resale. A Gift Card may not be resold; resale or attempted resale is grounds for immediate cancellation of the Gift Card without compensation or further notice. A Gift Card is not refundable or redeemable for cash, except where required by law. A recipient of a Gift Card may not transfer or assign the Gift Card.
    
* Geographic Restrictions. Gift cards may only be purchased and redeemed by individuals in the United States, using a payment method that was issued in the United States.
    
* Lost or Stolen Gift Card. The purchaser and recipient are responsible for securing the activation, redemption, and/or access numbers for a Gift Card (collectively, “Access Information”) and any Gift Card. Access Information may be used by anyone who obtains it. A lost or stolen Gift Card or Access Information will not be replaced. Cameo is not responsible for any lost or stolen Gift Card or Access Information or any unauthorized use of a Gift Card or Access Information.
* Endorsements. Your purchase of a Gift Card and the recipient’s use of the Gift Card are subject to the [Terms](https://www.cameo.com/termsofservice) including the [Acceptable Use Policy](#acceptable-use) / [Community Guidelines](https://www.cameo.com/communityguidelines) and you may not, among other things use a Gift Card in any manner that states or implies that any person, website, business, product, or service is endorsed or sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated with, a Cameo.
* Issuer may refuse, cancel, or hold for review any Gift Card, or any request to purchase, activate, or redeem a Gift Card, where it suspects fraud, mistake, alteration, error in denomination, or a violation of any applicable law or regulation, the [Terms](https://www.cameo.com/termsofservice), or these Additional Terms.

8. **Issuer Changes to Additional Terms  
    ‍**Issuer reserves the right to, and each holder or purchaser of a Gift Card agrees that Issuer may, at any time, change these Additional Terms, as permitted by applicable law, at its sole discretion. Such changes may make Gift Cards more or less desirable, effective, or functional. Current versions of these Additional Terms are accessible at [https://www.cameo.com/terms#giftcards](https://www.cameo.com/terms#giftcards)
9. **Choice of Law  
    ‍**The choice of law provision of the Site Terms will not apply to these Additional Terms. Except as governed by federal law, these Additional Terms, and any dispute between you and Issuer or Cameo relating to a Gift Card, regardless of whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.
10. **Waiver of Certain Rights  
    ‍**[Section 17 (Waiver of Certain Rights)](#waiver-certain-rights) of the Site Terms applies to the purchase and use of Gift Cards.
11. **Contact Us  
    **

* To check a Gift Card balance or value:

* email Issuer at giftcards@cameo.com; or
* call issuer toll-free at 1-800-243-1739.

### **CAMEO PASS AND CAMEO NFTS**

Last Updated: February 11, 2022

‍

These Additional Terms apply to your ownership and use of a Cameo Pass or any other non-fungible token issued by Cameo  
(a “Cameo NFT”) and all of the Cameo products, services, features, events, opportunities, offerings, and benefits available to you when you own a Cameo NFT (“Cameo Privileges”).

‍

* **Ownership of Cameo NFTs**.

* Each Cameo NFT is a unique, non-fungible token recorded on the designated blockchain for that NFT. The Cameo Pass is hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. The designated blockchain acts as a public, decentralized ledger system that records transfer, purchase, sale, and ownership of digital assets, including Cameo NFTs. To transfer, purchase, sell, or own Cameo NFTs you must set up, maintain, and agree to the terms and conditions of one of the supported third party electronic wallets, such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet and may also need to maintain an account with third party providers and agree to their terms and conditions. Whenever proof of purchase or ownership of a Cameo NFT is rightfully recorded on the designated blockchain, the then-currently recorded owner is deemed to own a Cameo NFT and receives a license and other benefits under these Additional Terms, subject to the owner’s compliance with the obligations and limits described below.
* Current ownership of a Cameo NFT, as rightfully recorded on the designated blockchain, entitles the owner to certain Cameo Privileges as described on Cameo’s Site. From time to time, Cameo may add or change Cameo Privileges in its sole discretion and without notice. In addition, access to some Cameo Privileges may include other requirements or limitations for participation. For instance, attendance at some events or access to some opportunities may be limited to a maximum number of participants and to Cameo NFT owners who meet age, residency, or other requirements and limitations.
* You may transfer or sell a Cameo NFT provided that:

* you are the current owner of the Cameo NFT;
* the transfer, purchase, sale, or ownership of the Cameo NFT does not violate any applicable laws;
* you make the new owner, purchaser, or transferee of the Cameo NFT aware of these Additional Terms; and  
    
* you acknowledge and agree that all transfers, purchases, or sales are subject to the automatic fee that is encoded in the smart contract associated with the Cameo NFT; for secondary sales of Cameo Pass or other Cameo NFTs, Cameo receives a fee of up to 10% of the gross amount paid by the purchaser, exclusive of any fees, “gas,” or other amount

2. **Assumption of Risk.** When you acquire a Cameo NFT, you acknowledge and agree that:

* Each Cameo NFT is recorded on the designated blockchain for that Cameo NFT. Cameo does not own, operate, or maintain the blockchain, payment system(s), electronic wallets, NFT marketplaces, or any other third party systems involved in transferring, purchasing, selling, maintaining, or owning Cameo NFTs. We cannot guarantee and have no responsibility for the operation of any of those systems or any other third party platform.
* Digital assets, NFTs (including Cameo NFTs), cryptocurrencies, and blockchains are new and experimental technologies, and the security and regulation of these technologies is continually evolving and accompanied by inherent risks. Because these technologies are highly experimental, risky, volatile, and may have no inherent value, your purchase of a Cameo NFT, whether through the Cameo platform or through a third party marketplace, may carry substantial financial risk, including the risk of loss in trading NFTs, other digital assets, or cryptocurrency. When you purchase or otherwise acquire a Cameo NFT, you represent that you have sufficient knowledge, sophistication, and experience with respect to NFTs, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology to make your own evaluation of the risks of the transaction. Under no circumstances should Cameo’s provision of any product or service, or promotion or statements about any Cameo NFT be construed as providing investment advice.  
    
* Cameo NFTs are not, are not based upon, and do not constitute an entitlement to any physical goods or real property, fractionalized ownership of any asset, an investment, security or other financial instrument (including anything governed by securities laws), currency(ies), or virtual currency(ies).
* You are solely responsible for: (i) determining whether your transfer, purchase, sale, ownership, or use of a Cameo NFTs requires the payment of any taxes and (ii) the payment of any applicable taxes.
* When you acquire or own a Cameo NFT, you are doing so voluntarily and at your own risk. Cameo issues Cameo NFTs, makes Cameo NFTs available for purchase, licenses certain rights to the owner of a Cameo NFT, and provides Cameo Privileges on an “as is” basis, and expressly disclaims any warranties or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose, as set forth in Section 17 of the Site Terms.

3. **Ownership of Artwork and Brand**. Each Cameo NFT embodies specific digital content (“Artwork”) and may contain trademarks, logos, publicity rights, other intellectual property, and brand elements ( collectively, “Brand”) owned or created by Cameo or its licensors, who may include Talent Users, artists, partners, or other third parties. Cameo and its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Artwork, Brand, and all intellectual property rights embodied by a Cameo NFT. No ownership (or license not specifically provided herein) of the Artwork and Brand is transferred with a Cameo NFT; instead the then-current owner of a Cameo NFT is granted only the limited rights as expressly permitted by the license below. Cameo and its licensors reserve all rights that are not expressly granted by the license below.  
    

4. **License**.

* Subject to your compliance with these Additional Terms, as well as our [Acceptable Use Policy](#acceptable-use) / [Community Guidelines](https://www.cameo.com/communityguidelines), Cameo grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, revocable license to use and display the Cameo NFT, including the Artwork and Brand solely as embodied by the specific Cameo NFT, and solely for the following purposes:

* for your own personal, non-commercial, and non-promotional purposes, including display in a virtual gallery, on mobile devices or personal computers, as an online avatar, or in your home;
* for transfer, purchase, or sale through the Cameo platform, or a third-party marketplace, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies ownership to ensure that only the then-current owner may offer the Cameo NFT for transfer, purchase, or sale;
* for display or use of your Cameo NFTs on the Cameo platform or a third party website or application, provided that the third party (A) cryptographically verifies ownership to ensure that only the then-current owner may display the Cameo NFT; and (B) removes the Cameo NFT, Artwork, and Brand from display whenever ownership of the Cameo NFT changes or the then-current owner stops using the website/application; or  
    
* to access Cameo Privileges.

2. You may sub-license the above rights only as strictly necessary for you to use a Cameo NFT as expressly permitted by this license.
3. This license:

* is automatically transferred with the lawful ownership of the Cameo NFT and is otherwise non-transferrable; and  
    
* does not include any rights to: (A) edit, change, modify, or create derivative works of the Artwork, or (B) use the Cameo NFT, Artwork, or Brand in connection with the creation of other NFTs or for any purpose other than those expressly permitted by these Additional Terms.

4. You may not use or attempt to register any asset, including any domain name, social media account or related address, that contains or incorporates the Cameo NFT, Artwork, Brand, or any other trademark, logo, name, intellectual property, or brand element that may be confusingly similar to any of Cameo’s or its licensors’ intellectual property.  
    

5. **Restrictions.**

1. You must be at least 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority under applicable law) to purchase or own a Cameo NFT. You may not sell or transfer a Cameo NFT to anyone who is not at least 18 (or the legal age of majority under applicable law).  
    
2. Access to Cameo Privileges and the license and any other rights granted to the owner of a Cameo NFT under these Additional Terms will immediately and automatically terminate and revert to Cameo without any notice to you, and you will have no further rights in the Cameo NFT, Artwork, or Brand embodied by that Cameo NFT, if:  
    

* you transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a Cameo NFT for any reason or any new owner is lawfully recorded on the designated blockchain for the Cameo NFT;  
    
* your transfer, purchase, sale, ownership, or use of a Cameo NFT is determined to be illegal or in violation of applicable law; or  
    
* your transfer, purchase, sale, ownership, or use of a Cameo NFT may reasonably breach these Site Terms, including Cameo’s Acceptable Use Policy / Community Guidelines, or you use, or cause or permit the use of, the Cameo NFT, Artwork or Brand in any manner that disparages Cameo, its products or services, the Cameo NFT, Cameo’s licensors, including Talent, and/or you associate, or cause or permit the association of, any of the foregoing with any mark, content, other intellectual property, product or service in a manner that Cameo, in its sole discretion, deems objectionable.  
    

3. If Cameo in its sole discretion questions the ownership or use of a Cameo NFT, Cameo may suspend your access to the rights and license provided by these Additional Terms, including the right to use and display Cameo NFTs, the Artwork, and/or Brand, and/or deny you access to Cameo Privileges, until such time as the ownership of the Cameo NFT has been reasonably established, as determined by Cameo in its sole discretion.  
    
4. You acknowledge and agree that you will not, and you will not assist or encourage any third party to do or attempt to do any of the following (unless, in each case, you have Cameo’s express prior written approval):  
    

* edit, change, or modify the Cameo NFT, Artwork, or Brand, including the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or colors;  
    
* commercialize or use the Artwork or Brand in any way other than (A) use as your avatar or profile picture on third-party websites and social media platforms; (B) to accurately describe the Cameo NFT in connection with your offer to transfer or sell it; or (C) for a Talent User, to promote, commercialize, and sell products or services on the Cameo platform, including CAMEO Videos;  
    
* claim, assert, or seek to register any intellectual property rights in the Cameo NFT, the Artwork, or Brand whether or not associated with your Cameo NFT; or  
    
* use the Cameo NFT, Artwork, or Brand in connection with an activity that violates Cameo’s Acceptable User Policy / Community Guidelines.  
    

5. These restrictions will survive the expiration or termination of the licenses granted hereunder.

### **CAMEO STORE AND MERCHANDISE**

Last updated: March 8, 2022

These Additional Terms apply when you buy physical goods and other non-digital merchandise, (“Cameo Merchandise”) at any online or brick-and-mortar Cameo store, including pop-up Cameo stores and events, subject to these terms (collectively, the “Cameo Store”). Orders from the Cameo Store may be fulfilled in whole or in part by any Cameo affiliate, division, or subsidiary, including Represent.com (a division of Cameo), by third parties such as Talent participating in the sale of Cameo Merchandise, or by our service providers.

* **Prices and Payment.**

* You may purchase Cameo Merchandise by paying in full using an applicable third-party payment provider we select as set forth in the Site Terms. You will be charged at the time of purchase.
* The purchase price and other charges applied to your order, including applicable shipping, handling, service, transaction, or processing fees and taxes, will be displayed during checkout and on payment pages of the Cameo Store, as well as your order confirmation email. You will be solely responsible for any customs fees, duties, or taxes incurred on your order after purchase.
* Cameo reserves the right to change prices for Cameo Merchandise at any time and for any reason, including to correct inaccuracies. If we change the price before your order is shipped or we discover that there has been an error in the pricing of your order, we will contact you and give you the opportunity to: (i) confirm the order at the correct price; or (ii) cancel the order and we will refund the amount you paid. If we are unable to reach you, we will cancel your order and refund the amount you paid.

2. **Placing Your Order.** To place an order, you must accurately provide the information requested on the checkout and payment pages, which may include your name, email address, telephone number, and billing and delivery addresses. During or after the Cameo checkout process, we or the applicable third-party payment provider may require additional information from you in order to process your order or your payment. Your order is an offer to buy the selected Cameo Merchandise pursuant to these Additional Terms and is subject to acceptance by us.
3. **Availability.** Cameo Merchandise is often unique, available in limited quantities, or made to order. We cannot guarantee that Cameo Merchandise offered for sale on the Site will be available when you order it or afterwards. We may limit the amount of Cameo Merchandise that you can purchase at any time, with or without notice, even after you have placed an order. Cameo also reserves the rights to: (a) withdraw or discontinue Cameo Merchandise at any time and for any reason; and (b) modify the Cameo Merchandise offered for sale through the Cameo Store, including the prices or specifications of such Cameo Merchandise, and any description, advertising, or promotional materials relating thereto at any time, with or without notice. If item(s) you ordered are not available by the time your order is processed, we will notify you by email.
4. **Confirmation.** When you have completed the checkout process successfully, we may send you an acknowledgement to confirm that we have received your order. That acknowledgment does not guarantee that the Cameo Merchandise you have ordered is available for purchase or signify Cameo’s acceptance of your offer to buy the item(s). When we send you an order confirmation containing an order ID by email, that email signifies Cameo’s acceptance of your offer to buy Cameo Merchandise.
5. **Errors and Inaccuracies.** We try to present you with images and descriptions of Cameo Merchandise that are accurate, up-to-date, and reliable. Sometimes there may be typographical errors, mistakes, or other inaccuracies. The images and descriptions of Cameo Merchandise are examples only and the actual products may vary in color, size, proportion, and otherwise. The actual images, colors, and proportions you see depend on what device you use to browse the Cameo Store, and that device may not display Cameo Merchandise accurately.
6. **Order Cancellation**. Cameo may, in its sole discretion, refuse or cancel any order at any time and for any reason, either in whole or in part, including when orders are submitted by resellers, dealers, and distributors. In the event that we cannot supply the Cameo Merchandise after you placed an order, we may send you substitute item(s) to consider (which can be returned for a full refund under Section 8 below if you are not completely satisfied). If we cancel your order in full, we will either not charge you or refund the amount you paid (including all shipping fees, taxes, and other charges applied to the order). If we only cancel part of your order after your payment has been processed, we will refund the amount billed for the canceled item(s).
7. **Shipping and Delivery.**

* We work hard to process and ship your order as quickly as possible. It may take ten business days or longer to ship your order when item(s) need to be made to order. Shipping options and any associated charges will be as provided on the checkout page and depend on a number of factors, including the shipping address, shipping method, and number and type of items included in the shipment. Some shipments may require a signature on delivery. If you specify a delivery address other than the billing address associated with your payment method, delivery to that address is at your own risk.  
    
* We ship to most countries, but there are legal and technical limitations that prevent us from shipping to any country listed [here](https://represent.com/unsupported-countries).
* Cameo takes great care to get your order to you undamaged. Title in the Cameo Merchandise, as well as all risk of damage or loss, passes to you when the Cameo Merchandise is delivered to the delivery address. Please check the Cameo Merchandise in the presence of the carrier to verify the condition of your order. Cameo will not be liable to you for any problems, issues, losses, damages, failures, defects, or delays in delivery if you provided incorrect information, used non-English language characters during checkout, or you did not accept the delivery (for example, your mailbox was full).

8. **Returns, Exchanges, and Replacements.  
    **

* We work hard to make sure that every purchase from the Cameo Store creates a magical moment. If you aren’t completely happy with your purchase, please contact at [merch@cameo.com](mailto:merch@cameo.com) within 30 days of the date of delivery.
* **The Return Process.** We want you to be completely satisfied with your order from the Cameo Store. If you are not completely satisfied with your unworn, unwashed, and unused order or prefer a different item, your order was lost or damaged during delivery, please let us know within the 30-day return period. We may in our sole discretion offer you a choice among the following options: (i) a replacement for the item(s) you ordered; (ii) a reasonable substitute item(s) for you to consider; (iii) credits you can use to make future purchases from the Cameo Store; or (iv) a full refund of your purchase price for returned item(s). In order to process your request, we may ask for photographic or other evidence of the item(s) you received. While we may not require it in every case, we reserve the right to require you to return the original item(s) at your expense (and, as applicable, in its or their original, unworn, unwashed, unused, and undamaged form) before processing your request.

**2\. Cameo Videos**

From time to time, a user of our Site (“User”) may request one or more video recordings (each, a “CAMEO Video”) from you through our Site.

1. While we hope you will fulfill a request within 48 hours of receiving it, you may have up to seven days or longer (at Cameo’s sole discretion) to complete and upload the CAMEO Video. If you do not either: (i) accept the request and upload the CAMEO Video; or (ii) decline the request; the request will expire and can no longer be fulfilled (except that you may fulfill the expired request at no cost to the User and with no payment due from us). You may decline a request or otherwise refuse, in your discretion, to create or upload a CAMEO Video if a User’s request is objectionable or otherwise offensive to you. If you accept a request, you agree to record and upload to our Site one CAMEO Video.
2. Cameo retains the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel any request from a User. No payment will be made to you for any declined, cancelled, or unfulfilled CAMEO Video request.
3. Each CAMEO Video will be approximately :30 in duration and will follow the general directions and requests of the User (for example, birthday message, congratulatory message, or “Good luck!” message). You will have sole discretion over the script and content of any CAMEO Video, except that you agree: (i) you will use your name (please introduce yourself), the User’s name, and the name of any third party that the User identifies as a recipient (“Recipient”) in each CAMEO Video, unless otherwise requested by the User; and (ii) you will not state in the CAMEO Video that the CAMEO Video is incomplete or cannot be completed. Your response to the User’s request is your responsibility and at your discretion, subject to these Terms; however, Users are usually happiest when at least the majority of their request is followed by a Talent User. If you complete a CAMEO Video but do not follow the general directions and requests of the User, we will discuss with you an appropriate adjustment of the payment made to you.

**4\. Fees & Payment**

1. Booking Fee: You set, or in certain cases may allow Cameo to set, the price for each CAMEO Video by you and any other offering you choose to make available through the Cameo marketplace platform (e.g., Business CAMEO Videos) (each, a “Booking Fee”), provided that: (i) prices on the App for iOS must be an available Apple SKU; and (ii) where there is no identical Apple SKU, each price will be the Apple SKU that is closest to the price set. In addition, the Booking Fee for each CAMEO Video must be at least US$5.00 (unless it is either US$0.00 or as otherwise agreed in writing by Cameo). The Booking Fee excludes any service, transaction, or processing fees paid to Cameo. You may not manipulate or alter your Booking Fee to create the false appearance that your offerings are discounted or on sale, or in any other manner that would be deceptive or misleading to consumers, as determined by Cameo in its sole discretion.
2. Fees: Other than with respect to an expired request that you choose to fulfill (as set forth in [Section 2(a)](https://legal.cameo.com/termsofservice#talent-videos)) and subject to these Terms, absent a separate agreement with you we will pay you 70% of the Booking Fee actually received by Cameo for each CAMEO Video or other Cameo product offering that you created and delivered to fulfill to a User’s request that you accepted through our Site, except that in the case of a Booking Fee paid through the App, we will pay you 70% of the amount actually received by Cameo after subtracting any payment to or deduction by the application platform (e.g., Apple deducts a 30% commission from the Booking Fee) from the Booking Fee (“Net App Booking Fee”). In addition, if the offering permits a User to designate an additional amount that is explicitly referred to as a "tip", we will pay you 100% of any amount paid by a User via our Site as such a "tip" (after subtracting any Cameo service fees and any payment to or deduction by the application platform). Any Sales Tax Cameo collects will be remitted to the applicable tax authority and will not be included in the Booking Fee or tip.

3. Fees and Payment Representations and Warranties: You represent and warrant that: (i) except as set forth in [Section 4.g.](https://www.cameo.com/termsofservice#talent-terms-4g), CAMEO Videos are not, and are not intended to be, covered by any union or guild collective bargaining agreement, management, agency, or similar agreement, and there will be no residual or any other type of payment or contribution due from Cameo to you, to any third-party related to you or on your behalf, to any union, guild, pension plan, health plan, management, agent, or other similar person or entity pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement, in connection with any CAMEO Video, payment from us to you, or our Site; (ii) Cameo is not responsible for, and will not make any deduction to payments made to you for any fees, commissions, costs, expenses, or payments of any kind to or with respect to any third party, including any manager, agent, attorney, representative, or service provider, in connection with any revenue earned by or payments made to you in connection with our Site; and (iii) Cameo is not responsible for any contributions, payments, taxes, or deductions for Social Security, retirement benefits, unemployment insurance, annuities, or pension or welfare fund payments required by law or any labor union, or any withholding or taxes (other than Sales Tax Cameo collects in relation to a purchase).
    
4. Payment: You agree to register with the third-party payment provider selected by Cameo, which Cameo may change in its sole discretion. You may not use a payment provider other than the one selected by Cameo. You will provide the payment provider any information required in order to receive payments via the payment provider, e.g., information about the bank account that you own at a regulated financial institution. Any payments due to you from Cameo will be made via the payment provider. If available, you may transfer funds from your Cameo account to your bank account by submitting a payment request. Your request will be processed by the payment provider. If not available, Cameo will submit the payment request, for processing by the payment provider. In addition, Cameo may, in its sole discretion: (i) transfer funds from your Cameo account to your bank account, including in the case of account inactivity; and (ii) restrict or prohibit withdrawals in excess of any threshold chosen by Cameo. **If you do not provide the payment provider with all required information, you may not be able to receive the payments due to you. Cameo will not be responsible for any damages, delays, losses, costs, expenses, or liabilities arising out of or in connection with your inability to receive payments as a result of your failure to provide such information.** You acknowledge and agree that Cameo does not operate, own, or control the payment provider; and your use of any payment provider is subject to the terms and privacy policies of that payment provider. You agree that we are not responsible for any delay, failure, damage, or liability caused by a payment provider, any other third party, a force majeure, or your failure to timely or properly set up an account with the payment provider or otherwise provide requested information for payment. Other than with respect to any payment to or deduction by the application platform (as set forth in [Section 4.b](https://legal.cameo.com/termsofservice#talent-fees-payment)). Cameo will be responsible for fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the payment provider selected by Cameo. Unless otherwise agreed by Cameo in writing, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any other fees, costs, and expenses, including with respect to your bank account and foreign exchange fees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms, if Cameo, in its sole discretion, believes that any fraud, money laundering, or other violation of law or regulation is taking place on or in connection with our Site, you acknowledge and agree that we may withhold, delay, or seek repayment of any payments we believe, in our sole discretion, are related to the violation.
    
5. Currency: Payments via the payment provider are in U.S. dollars unless the payment provider permits you to choose another currency and you do so.
    
6. Fundraising: If you identify any entity on your booking page or elsewhere on our Site as a charitable organization or a recipient of any funds that you are raising (each, a “Charity”), you: (i) represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to that identification or the Charity, including making disclosures, registering, or entering into any agreement, such as a commercial co-venturer agreement; (ii) acknowledge and agree that we have the right in our sole discretion to reject your identification or the Charity; (iii) represent and warrant that the Charity is and will remain in good standing at all times the identification is used, that within 48 hours of your receipt of our request, you will provide us with written evidence of the Charity’s good standing and charitable status in all applicable jurisdictions, and that you will promptly remove the identification if the Charity ceases to be in good standing; (iv) represent and warrant that you will be responsible for making any payment to the Charity (unless we expressly agree in writing in advance to do so on your behalf and in satisfaction of our payment obligations to you under these Terms); and (v) represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to authorize use of the Charity’s name and logo in connection with (and on) our Site, in the identification, and in any social and other media. You further acknowledge and agree that we may add a statement to your booking page disclaiming a connection between Cameo and the Charity, as we determine in our sole discretion.

Influencer Agreements: Notwithstanding [Section 4.c.](https://www.cameo.com/termsofservice#talent-terms-4c) or any other provision of these Terms to the contrary, for any Business CAMEO Video you choose to fulfill, you may, in your discretion and subject to any obligations between you and the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (“SAG-AFTRA”), choose to produce such Business CAMEO Video pursuant to the terms of the Talent-Produced Cameo for Business Sponsored Content Agreement or another Influencer-Produced Sponsored Content Agreement made available by SAG-AFTRA (each, an “Influencer Agreement”).

We offer Talent Users and others who register on our Site as a talent referral source (“Cameo Partner”) the opportunity to provide their friends, families, or other personal contacts the unique referral code we provide you (“Code”) that a prospective talent user may use to apply to register as a talent user on our Site (“Referral Program”). **To participate in the Referral Program, you must agree to the following Talent Referral Program Terms (“Referral Terms”), as well as the rest of these Terms:**

1. Cameo reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Referral Program or your participation in the Referral Program at any time for any reason. Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to disqualify anyone from participating in the Referral Program at any time at our sole discretion. A violation of the Referral Terms may also result in the forfeiture of all Referral Fees (defined below) you earned through the Referral Program. We reserve the right to review and investigate activities undertaken in connection with the Referral Program and suspend your Site account, modify the Referral Fee, or take other action in our sole discretion.
2. Eligibility to participate in this Referral Program is limited to individuals who have registered an account on our Site as a Talent User or Cameo Partner. The Referral Program cannot be used for affiliate lead generation or other commercial purposes. Employees, officers, directors, contractors, agents, and representatives of Cameo may not participate in the Referral Program.
3. For every new user whose application to register as a Talent User on our Site using your Code is accepted in writing by Cameo (“Referred Talent”), Cameo will pay you, for one year, beginning as of the date that the Referred Talent first created an account as a Talent User on our Site using your Code, 5% of the Booking Fee actually received by Cameo, except that in the case of a Booking Fee paid through the App, it is 5% of the Net App Booking Fee, for each CAMEO Video the Referred Talent creates and delivers to fulfill a User’s request accepted through our Site during that one-year period (excluding any CAMEO Video for which no revenue was earned, and, at Cameo’s discretion, any CAMEO Video to which a promotion applies or for which a promo code was used) (“Referral Fee”). The Referral Fee is based on the Booking Fee or Net App Booking Fee but is paid from Cameo’s share of the revenue (as described in [Section 4.b](#talent-fees-payment)) and will be paid as described in [Section 4.d](#talent-fees-payment). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that if a new user does not use your Code when applying to register, has previously registered on our Site (with another code, under another name, or otherwise), has previously begun the on-boarding process for our Site, or if anyone else has received or is receiving a Referral Fee from us in connection with that user, no Referral Fee will be due to you. You further acknowledge and agree that each Referred Talent may have only one referring person or entity, and that we are not obligated to pay a Referral Fee to more than one referring person or entity with respect to any Referred Talent.
4. This Referral Program may be used only for personal purposes and you may share your Code only with your personal connections. You may not advertise your Code or share it with anyone other than your friends, family, or other personal contacts (for example, you may not share it on a social media channel). We reserve the right to revoke or refuse to issue any Referral Fees for Referred Talent that we suspect were generated through improper channels or otherwise in violation of these Referral Terms.
5. You represent and warrant that any messages you use to share your Code with your personal connections will: (i) be created and distributed in a personal manner; (ii) not be distributed in a bulk manner; and (iii) not be an unsolicited commercial email or a “spam” message under any applicable law or regulation. Any messages that do not meet these requirements are expressly prohibited and constitute grounds for immediate termination of your Site account and participation in this Referral Program. Registrations on our Site by a Talent User using a Code that was distributed through an unauthorized channel will not be valid and any Referral Fees issued in connection with such transactions may be revoked.
6. We reserve the right to deactivate your Site account and any Referred Talent’s Site account, cancel all related Referral Fees, and seek repayment, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that either you or the Referred Talent: (i) has tampered with this Referral Program; (ii) has used (or attempted to use) this Referral Program in a fraudulent, abusive, unethical, unsportsmanlike, or otherwise questionable or suspicious manner; (iii) has breached any of these Referral Terms; or (iv) has violated any law or regulation or infringed or violated the rights of any third party. We also reserve the right to cancel this Referral Program or change these Referral Terms at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion.
7. As of the effective date of these Terms and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Talent User may become an Affiliated Talent to an Organization, subject to Cameo’s prior approval, by: (i) confirming in writing, in the form provided by Cameo, that the Organization is its representative; and (ii) the Organization registering the Talent User as its Affiliated Talent. The Organization will be deemed a Cameo Partner and the Affiliated Talent will be deemed a Referred Talent under these Referral Terms. The Organization (as a Cameo Partner) will be entitled to the Referral Fee set forth in [Section 5.c](#talent-referrals) as of the date the Talent User becomes an Affiliated Talent.
8. By participating in the Referral Program, you agree to release and hold harmless Cameo Parties from and against any and all economic liabilities, claims, damages, loss, harm, costs, or expenses, including property damage, that arise from or relate in any way to the Referral Program. THIS [SECTION 5.h](#talent-referrals) APPLIES ONLY TO ECONOMIC DAMAGES AND DOES NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS OF FRAUD OR PERSONAL INJURY.

1. **Talent Store**

1. You may choose to collaborate with Cameo to design, create, produce, or offer for sale custom apparel, physical goods and other non-digital merchandise dedicated to you and customized with your Talent Content, excluding all other Cameo products, services, software, or digital assets (“Talent Merchandise”).
2. **Approval and Exclusivity**. If you approve an order form or rate sheet in writing, including by email, or otherwise through the Cameo platform (the “Order Form”), you appoint Cameo as the exclusive printer of the Talent Merchandise identified in the Order Form, customized with the Talent Content you specify (each, a “Talent Product”) and exclusive seller and distributor of the Talent Products you choose to offer, as seller, through the Site, including through your booking page (the “Talent Store”).
3. Unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form or mutually agreed in writing, you agree that Cameo will make the Talent Store available for an initial term of one year (the “Term”) and automatic annual renewals. An Order Form shall automatically renew and be extended year to year for successive one-year Terms, until the Order Form is terminated under Section 9 below.

2. **Cameo Responsibilities  
    **

1. **Talent Products.** Cameo will arrange for the manufacture, printing, sale, and distribution of the Talent Products, customized with the Talent Content you specify as identified in the Order Form. For the avoidance of doubt, Talent Content includes any modifications Cameo makes to Talent Content that have been mutually agreed in writing.
2. **Design Services.** Unless the Order Form specifies in writing that the Talent Content you provide is the entire design, Cameo will provide design services that include developing content or other materials (“Design Materials”) to be included on Talent Product.

3. **Your Responsibilities  
    **

1. **Talent User Design.** If the Order Form indicates or you otherwise agree in writing to provide the entire design for Talent Products, you will be solely responsible for the design, subject to these Additional Terms (including Section 3.c), and the entire design will be Talent Content.

1. (A) You may not provide any Talent Content or Talent IP containing Third-Party Materials unless you have secured Legal Clearances.
2. (B) At Cameo’s request, you will promptly provide written copies of Legal Clearances to Cameo. Cameo may, in its reasonable discretion (1) require you to modify or provide alternative Talent Content or Talent IP; or (2) provide additional Legal Clearances.

1. You remain solely responsible for Legal Clearances regardless of whether Cameo has accepted or rejected them. Cameo will not be responsible for any delays in connection with the Legal Clearance process or any Legal Clearance.

You acknowledge and agree that the above exclusivity and restrictions are necessary for successful operation of the Talent Store.
