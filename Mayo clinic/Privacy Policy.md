In addition to this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”), users of the Mayo Clinic Site should consult the Mayo Clinic Site [Terms of Use](https://www.mayoclinic.org/content/mayoclinic/about-this-site/terms-conditions-use-policy) as well as any product-specific terms and conditions that apply. You may review [policies](https://mcforms.mayo.edu/mc5200-mc5299/mc5256-01.pdf) specifically related to patient information (protected health information or PHI) submitted through Mayo Clinic's [Patient Portal](https://onlineservices.mayoclinic.org/content/staticpatient/showpage/patientonline).

This Privacy Policy applies to all Sites where it is posted. Other Mayo Clinic online properties may have their own privacy policies that apply to those sites. You should review those privacy policies in connection with your use of those sites.

* Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research, development, and marketing purposes; and
* Details of transactions you carry out through our Sites and of the fulfillment of your orders. You may be required to provide financial information before placing an order through our Sites.

You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, **“Posted”**) on public areas of the Sites or transmitted to other users of the Sites or third parties (collectively, **“User Contributions”**). Your User Contributions are Posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Although we limit access to certain pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Sites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

**Information we collect automatically:** We collect information about you automatically as you navigate through or use our Sites. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, session replay and recording technology (recording your movements, clicks, etc. on our Sites), and information collected through cookies, web beacons, pixels tags, and other tracking technologies. As you navigate through and interact with our Sites, we may use automatic data collection technologies (such as session replay and tracking technologies referred to above) to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, specifically:

You may disable this functionality on your mobile device by removing permission for the Mayo Clinic app to use location services at any time.

The information we collect automatically may include Personal Data or we may maintain or associate information we collect with Personal Data we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. It helps us to improve our Sites and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to:

* estimate our audience size and usage patterns;
* improve our product and services offering;
* store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Sites according to your individual interests; and
* recognize and/or authenticate you when you return to our Sites.

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

* **Cookies (or browser cookies)**. We and our service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Sites through your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a small file or piece of data sent from a website and stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device. On your computer, you may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser, and you may have similar capabilities on your mobile device in the preferences for your operating system or browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access or use certain parts of our Sites. Unless you have adjusted your browser or operating system setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website or use our App.
* **Pixels and Web Beacons**. Pages on our Sites, or our e-mails, may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related Sites statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain Sites content and verifying system and server integrity). For example, we use Tealium, Inc. (“Tealium”), to understand how users interact with our Sites. We use this information to assist us in improving our user experience.
* **Google Analytics**. We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (**“Google”**) to collect certain information relating to your use of our Sites. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help our Sites analyze how users use the Sites. You can find out more about how Google uses data when you visit our Sites by visiting “How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services” (located at [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)). We may also use Google Analytics Advertising Features or other advertising networks to provide you with interest-based advertising based on your online activity. For more information regarding Google Analytics please visit Google's website, and pages that describe Google Analytics, such as [https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/).
* **Do Not Track Signals.** Some web browsers permit you to broadcast a signal to websites and online services indicating a preference that they “do not track” your online activities. At this time, we do not honor such signals. However, we do not track your online activities on or across third party websites or other online services for any purpose, including advertising, unless you specifically opt-in to a program or campaign that authorizes such tracking.

Email communications, newsletter, and related services

Our Sites provide you with the opportunity to receive communications from us or third parties. For example, you can sign up for a free Mayo Clinic email newsletter. You can unsubscribe from this newsletter at any time. You may use the unsubscribe mechanism or link in our marketing emails if you wish to stop receiving marketing emails from us.

Email communications that you send to us via the email links on our Site may be shared with a customer service representative, employee, medical expert, or agent that is most able to address your inquiry. We make every effort to respond in a timely fashion once communications are received. Once we have responded to your communication, it is discarded or archived, depending on the nature of the inquiry. Note, that email communications that you send us via the email links on our Site are not automatically encrypted, and it is possible that unencrypted email communications with us may be accessed or viewed by another internet user while in transit to us.

The information may be shared with third parties with whom we have a business relationship. We generally do not ask for information in surveys that would personally identify you; if we do request contact information for follow-up, you may decline to provide it. If survey respondents provide personal information (such as an email address) in a survey, it is shared only with those people who need to see it to respond to the question or request, or with third parties who perform data management services for our site. Those third parties have agreed to keep all data from surveys confidential.

Security
--------

Whether you are visiting the Mayo Clinic Site or one of our clinic locations, we use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information under our control, and we appropriately limit access to it. We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us. The Mayo Clinic Site uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL protects information you submit via our website, such as ordering information including your name, address, and credit card number. That being said, Mayo Clinic cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personally identifiable information that you may provide. You should understand, however, that electronic transmissions via the internet are not necessarily secure from interception, and so we cannot absolutely guarantee the security or confidentiality of such transmissions.
