E-Commerce
----------

**Payment.** A valid credit card number, expiration date, and card security code is required for all purchases on the Mayo Clinic Store and Mayo Clinic Marketplace. If we are unable to charge the full cost of your purchase to the credit card you provide, we may cancel your order or request an alternate form of payment. Mayo Clinic's designated credit card processor will collect your credit card information and related personal information for its use in processing your payment for the products or services ordered by you. Any complaints or grievances regarding the processing of your payment should be addressed to Mayo Clinic at [mayoclinicsupport@mayoclinic.com](mailto:mayoclinicsupport@mayoclinic.com). You understand that the prices for products and services may be changed from time to time.

If you enroll to make recurring payments automatically, all charges and fees will be billed to the credit card you designate during the setup process. If you want to designate a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card, you must change your information online. This may temporarily delay your ability to make online payments while we verify your new payment information.

You represent and warrant that if you are making online payments that (i) any credit card, debit card, or bank account information you supply is true, correct, and complete, (ii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit/debit card company or bank, (iii) you will pay the charges incurred by you in the amounts posted, including any applicable taxes, (iv) you are the person in whose name the card was issued, and (v) you are authorized to make a purchase or other transaction with the relevant credit card and credit card information.

**Prescriptions.** Some products available through the Mayo Clinic Store site may require a valid prescription by a licensed healthcare provider (“**Provider**”). Mayo Clinic does not endorse any specific device, durable medical equipment, medication, pharmacy, or pharmacologic product (collectively “Prescription Product”). If a Provider prescribes a Prescription Product, he/she will limit supply based upon state regulations and will only prescribe a Prescription Product as determined in his/her own discretion and professional judgment. There is no guarantee a prescription will be written. You agree that any prescriptions that you acquire from a Provider will be solely for your personal use. You agree to fully and carefully read all provided product information and labels and to contact a physician or pharmacist if you have any questions regarding the prescription. Mayo Clinic fully honors patient freedom of choice and, if you receive a prescription for a Prescription Product from Mayo Clinic or a Mayo Provider, you always have the option to instruct Mayo Clinic to transmit that prescription to the pharmacy of your choice. Any questions about prescriptions for Mayo Clinic Store purchases should be directed to [accounts@store.mayoclinic.com](mailto:accounts@store.mayoclinic.com).

**Responsibility for charges and fees; Insurance.** You are solely responsible for all charges and applicable fees (including delivery charges, taxes and any fees assessed by your bank) associated with your order from the Mayo Clinic Store. Some products or charges may be eligible for payment or reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, out-of-state workers' compensation payer, or other insurance plan. Regardless of insurance coverage and reimbursement amounts, you will be responsible for the purchase price and all charges associated with your order and product purchase. Any questions about insurance coverage for Mayo Clinic Store purchases should be directed to [accounts@store.mayoclinic.com](mailto:accounts@store.mayoclinic.com).

Indemnification
---------------

You agree that you will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Mayo Clinic from and against any damages, losses, liabilities, judgments, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) against or incurred by Mayo Clinic arising out of a claim by a third party relating to your breach of these Terms of Use or applicable law, User-Generated Content and any other materials you post or allow to be posted to the Site, your use or access of the Site, access of this Site by anyone using your user ID and password, or any other actions taken by you on the Site.
