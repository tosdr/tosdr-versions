Atlassian Cookies & Tracking Notice
===================================

_Effective starting: July 1, 2023_

### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:

Atlassian and our third party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use various technologies to collect information, such as cookies and web beacons.

_What types of technologies do we use?_

We use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to improve and customize our products and websites ("the Services") and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Services without re-entering your username or password; to understand usage of our Services and the interests of our customers; to determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon; and to present you with advertising relevant to your interests.

_How do we use them?_

* **Where strictly necessary.**  These cookies and other technologies are essential in order to enable the Services to provide the feature you have requested, such as remembering you have logged in.
* **For functionality.**  These cookies and similar technologies remember choices you make such as language or search parameters. We use these cookies to provide you with an experience more appropriate with your selections and to make your use of the Services more tailored.
* **For performance and analytics.**  These cookies and similar technologies collect information on how users interact with the Services and enable us to improve how the Services operate. For example, we use Google Analytics cookies to help us understand how visitors arrive at and browse our [products](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy/product-family) and website to identify areas for improvement such as navigation, user experience, and marketing campaigns. 
* **For research**. We receive aggregated non-personally-identifiable information from third party research partners that they have collected using cookies and pixels. These cookies and pixels collect information about how effective our advertising campaigns may be to users who have opted in to being contacted by Atlassian for research purposes.
* **Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies.**  These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests. They remember the websites you have visited and that information is shared with other parties such as advertising technology service providers and advertisers.
* **Social media cookies.** These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our websites or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social media site. The social network will record that you have done this. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities.

_How can you opt-out?_

To opt-out of our use of cookies, you can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Services. Atlassian and our third party partners also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels").

Many browsers include their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage objects. To manage "flash cookies" please click [here](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). Depending where you live, you may also have the right to opt out of targeted advertising and/or certain third-party cookies, as described in the [Privacy Policy](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy-may-25th) under "Your Choices."

You will not be able to opt-out of any cookies or other technologies that are “strictly necessary” for the Services.

_Updates to this Notice_ 

This Cookies & Tracking Notice may be updated from time to time.  If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the "effective starting" date at the top of this notice.
