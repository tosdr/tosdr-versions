You understand that when you submit a request to participate in mentoring, and when you participate in mentoring, you are signifying that you agree to the terms and conditions of our mentoring outlined as follows:  You request business management mentoring from SCORE. You agree to cooperate should you be selected to participate in surveys designed to evaluate your business and provide services to you.  You understand that any information disclosed by SCORE to the Small Business Administration (SBA), or SBA representatives will be held in confidence to the extent that it will only be disclosed to SBA representatives to review and process your application; the information submitted in your SBA application will not be disclosed to commercial entities.
