### MENTORING DISCLAIMER

You understand that SCORE may not utilize resources to provide support to clients who have a business or want to start a business, outside of the United States and its territories.

You understand that when you submit a request to participate in mentoring, and when you participate in mentoring, you are signifying that you agree to the terms and conditions of our mentoring outlined as follows:  You request business management mentoring from SCORE. You agree to cooperate should you be selected to participate in surveys designed to evaluate your business and provide services to you.  You understand that any information disclosed by SCORE to the Small Business Administration (SBA), or SBA representatives will be held in confidence to the extent that it will only be disclosed to SBA representatives to review and process your application; the information submitted in your SBA application will not be disclosed to commercial entities. You agree to the disclosure of your information to SBA representatives to process your mentoring application if required by SCORE. By submitting an SBA application, you authorize SCORE, and if necessary, SBA, to furnish relevant information to the assigned management mentor(s).  You further understand that all mentors have agreed _not_ to: (1) recommend goods or services from sources in which they have an interest and (2) accept fees or commissions developing from this mentoring relationship. In consideration of the furnishing of management or technical assistance, you waive all claims against SCORE, SBA personnel, Small Business Development Centers and their host organizations, and other SBA resource mentors arising from this assistance.
