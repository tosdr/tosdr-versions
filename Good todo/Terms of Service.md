Good Todo Terms of Use
======================

Welcome to Good Todo!

By using Good Todo's web site or mobile apps ("Service"), you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Terms of Use" or "Agreement").

1. General.
    
    Goodtodo.com is an Internet-based todo list service. The Service is owned and operated by Creative Good Projects, LLC ("Creative Good"), a New York Corporation, d/b/a Good Todo ("Good Todo"). Good Todo operates a web site, goodtodo.com (the "web site") as well as mobile apps, all of which are designed to assist you in maintaining your todo list. Your use of the Service is governed by this Agreement.
    
    Creative Good reserves the right to update, change or modify content on the Site and these Terms of Use from time to time without prior notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service shall be subject to the Terms of Use. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Creative Good is not liable to you or any third party for any price modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Use at any time at [https://goodtodo.com/main/terms/](https://goodtodo.com/main/terms/). Your use of the Good Todo Service indicates that you accept and are bound by this Agreement.
    
2. Trademark and copyright protection.
    
    The rights of Good Todo are protected by law, incorporated by reference as if set forth in full herein. We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your todo list and materials uploaded remain yours. The look and feel of the Service is copyright (c) Creative Good Projects, LLC. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate copy or reuse any portion of the HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission of Creative Good Projects, LLC.
    
3. Activation and Use.
    1. Purchase of Good Todo.
        
        In order to access the Service, you must be 18 years of age or older. (If you are under 18, you may use Good Todo only with involvement of a parent or guardian.) You must first obtain a Username/Password combination registering on the web site. You must then log on to the Service using the Username/Password combination. Failure to do so will breach this Agreement.
        
        1. Free Trial.
            
            You can arrange for a free thirty (30) day trial of the Service by typing in a unique username/password combination on the goodtodo.com web site.
            
        2. Purchase/Cancellation.
            1. A valid credit card or Paypal account is required for paying (non-trial) accounts. The Service is billed in advance, on a six (6) month basis and is nonrefundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service or refunds for months unused with an open account. The Service costs $8.00 per month in blocks of six (6) months (i.e., the standard payment is $48.00). All charges are in U.S. dollars. If you do not cancel your account before the expiration of a six (6) month term, we will bill you for the next six-month term.
                
            2. Prices for all Services, including, without limitation, the monthly subscription plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes on this site. Such price increase shall not affect, however, those subscribers who have pre-paid for such period, and shall only take effect at the time of renewal.
                
            3. All subscription payments are exclusive of state and local sales and other taxes, levies and duties, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, and duties, excluding only federal and state income taxes imposed within the United States.
                
            4. If you wish to cancel your account, use the Cancel My Account link available on the Preferences page on the web site.
                
            5. Account deletion: If you use the Cancel My Account feature, or if your renewal date passes without a renewal payment, your account and all associated data will be fully deleted after a "grace period," which allows users to renew their account data for a period after the renewal date. However, if you wish for your account data to be deleted more quickly, contact Creative Good via our Contact form at [https://creativegood.com/contact/](https://creativegood.com/contact/) and request the deletion of your cancelled account. We will delete the account and all associated data from the goodtodo.com site, then confirm with you once it is done. Your data will also be deleted from our backup servers as they complete the full rotation of their rolling backups in several days. To delete your data from your local mobile device, simply delete the Good Todo mobile app from the device.
                
    2. Impermissible Uses.
