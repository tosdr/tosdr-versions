NOTICE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: This agreement includes a binding arbitration clause and a class action waiver, set forth below in section 21, which affects your rights about resolving any dispute with StackCommerce. Please read it carefully.

1. **About the Network.** The Network is a platform through which certain vendors (“Vendors”) make available digital or physical Product(s) for purchase.

StackCommerce shall not be liable for any claim arising out of or relating to the Products and services provided by Vendors, including but not limited to, any claims for false advertising, product defects, personal injury, death, or property damages (i.e. if the goods or service does not achieve a standard quality, or if the goods or services may affect the health of the User, etc.).
    
    StackCommerce attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, StackCommerce does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any StackCommerce Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.
    
    With respect to items sold by StackCommerce, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Offers for Products purchased at discount prices are often subject to time limits or other restrictions which may require you to complete the transaction within a certain timeframe or in a certain manner in order to receive the benefit of the offer. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by StackCommerce is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
    
    Refund policies differ based on the Vendor and product offered on the Network. The product page will contain information on the refund policy as it relates to that product.
    

9. **Promotions.** From time to time we may make sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions available through our Networks (“Promotion”) that require you to register and accept additional provisions to participate. Please review the applicable rules, terms, and disclaimers that govern each Promotion and understand that participation is your unconditional agreement and acceptance thereto.
    

10. **Credits.** Credits may be issued by StackCommerce and/or earned through Rewards Programs. Credits can only be used for purchases online on the websites, applications, and platforms in the Network. Credits can only be used on orders associated with a single account and cannot be transferred to another person or account. Remaining credit balance can be found under the "Credits" tab in your Account or by contacting our Support Team. Credits issued by StackCommerce and/or its Support Team, whether for refunds and/or exchanges, never expire. Credits earned through Rewards Programs may expire and are subject to the Reward Programs terms below.
    
    StackCommerce reserves the right to change, modify and/or eliminate the terms with regards to Credits at any time and in its sole discretion. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions and you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications.
    

11. **Reward Programs.** Please read these terms and conditions of participation in StackCommerce's Rewards Programs, including but not limited to the "Refer-A-Friend Program". By participating in any of these programs, you agree to be bound by the terms described herein and all terms incorporated by reference. If you do not agree to these terms of use, do not participate in the rewards programs.
    
    These Terms of Use apply to your access to, and participation in, any of StackCommerce's Rewards Programs ("Reward Programs"). These Terms of Use do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with StackCommerce. StackCommerce reserves the right to change, modify, and/or eliminate the Reward Programs and/or all or any portion of these Terms of Use or any policy, FAQ, or guideline pertaining to the Reward Programs at any time and in its sole discretion. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions and you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your participation in the Reward Programs confirms your acceptance of these Terms of Use and any such changes or modifications; therefore, you should receive these Terms of Use and applicable policies and FAQs frequently.
    
    1. **Membership and Eligibility.** The Rewards Programs are offered at the sole discretion of StackCommerce. The Rewards Programs are available to individuals for their personal use only and is limited to one account per individual. Individuals who are at least 18 years or older and who provide and maintain a valid account are eligible to become members. No purchase is necessary to join the Rewards Programs. Employees of StackCommerce and individuals employed by our business partners or vendors are eligible for membership for personal use only but may be excluded from certain benefits of Reward Programs.
    
    2. **Earning and Redeeming Rewards.** StackCommerce offers 1 Reward Program: (1) I Refer-A-Friend Program. All members with valid accounts are automatically enrolled in the Refer-A-Friend Program upon account creation.
        * Under the Refer-A-Friend program, credits are earned for the first purchase made on each new account registered from a Referrer's unique referral link. To be eligible to earn credits, the Referrer must maintain an active consumer account and the Referred Customer must not have an existing account. Credits earned from the Refer-A-Friend Program will be automatically applied to your account once the Referred Customer has made his or her first purchase. Minimum purchase amounts and some exclusions may apply.
            
    
    It's our hope that you redeem your credits on a regular basis. All unredeemed credits earned from the Rewards Programs shall expire 90 days from the date of issuance. Credits are based on the pre-tax purchase total amount and/or other applicable fees, such as shipping or delivery fees. If you make a purchase using a coupon, credits are based on the total post coupon application.
    
    Neither accounts nor rewards or credits may be shared. Only the member paying for the products may accumulate rewards or credits. We reserve the right to monitor the number of accounts per household and refuse, merge or close additional or duplicate accounts at any time. The rewards or credits earned through the Rewards Programs may not be exchanged for cash (unless required by law), are non-transferrable, cannot be sold, returned or exchanged, and you have no property rights in or to the rewards or other Program benefits. Credits earned will be decreased or reserved, as applicable, if part or all of the purchase is returned or cancelled or if the credit is obtained through fraudulent or other activity that violates these terms. StackCommerce is not responsible for lost or stolen credits. The sale, barter, transfer, or assignment of any credits offered through the Rewards Programs, other than by us, is expressly prohibited.
    

12. **Subscription Products.**
    
    1. **About the Subscription Product ("Subscription").** In addition to selling Products on a one-off basis, we also make available Subscriptions that allow for the recurring use of Products provided by third party vendors over a set duration of time.The Subscription can be accessed either via a Free Trial or through a Paid Subscription. The Free Trial gives you (free) full access to the products contained in the Subscription for a finite duration. The Paid Subscription is a fee-based program which gives you full access to the products within the Subscription. You will only have access to the Products contained in the Subscription while your Subscription is active and subsisting. You may have access to a Free Trial of the Paid Subscription made available to you during a promotional offer. You can become a subscriber to the Paid Subscription by purchasing a Subscription on the Network or when your Free Trial converts if not cancelled before the end of the Free Trial.
    
    2. **Free Trials.** We may offer trials of our Paid Subscription (Free Trial) for a specified period of time that provides full access to the Subscription without requiring payment. We may determine the eligibility for a Free Trial and withdraw or modify a Free Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.The Free Trial will begin on the day you sign-up and checkout with the Subscription in your cart, not on the day you redeem/start using any Products contained in the Subscription. For most Free Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to begin the Free Trial. By providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Free Trial on a recurring monthly basis or annual basis depending on the type of Paid Subscription you select. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL.
    
    3. **Billing.** We offer both a monthly and annual Paid Subscription plans. You may purchase a Paid Subscription by paying a fee in advance on a monthly or annual basis. We may change the price of a Paid Subscription, including recurring subscription fees from time to time and will communicate any price change to you in advance, and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Any price change will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the price change by continuing to utilize the Products after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price change, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.For monthly Paid Subscriptions, for each month that your Paid Subscription is active, you acknowledge and agree that we are authorized to charge the same credit card that was used for the initial subscription fee (Payment Method). For annual Paid Subscriptions, each year is paid for by an upfront payment that will automatically renew and you authorize us to continue to charge your Payment Method while the subscription is active.
    
    4. **Renewals and Cancellation.** Your subscription period will begin on the day you purchase a Paid Subscription or the day your Free Trial converts to a Paid Subscription. Monthly Paid Subscriptions purchased on the 31st of a given month will always be billed on the last day of each subsequent month.Your Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect on the day after the last day of the current subscription period. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE IT RENEWS IN ORDER TO AVOID THE BILLING OF THE RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION FEE TO THE PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDED.
