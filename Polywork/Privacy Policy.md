Last Updated: March 3rd, 2022

This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal information in connection with our services.

**Who We Are:** Polywork is a platform for you to showcase your professional identity. Polywork is headquartered in New York, USA. When we use the terms “Polywork”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this Privacy Notice, we are referring to Kalo Industries Inc and Kalo Industries Ltd.

**Our Services:** When we use the term “services”, we are referring to all the services that we offer on our own behalf, including our product offerings and the websites and mobile applications that post or link to this Notice. This Privacy Notice does not cover or address personal information and privacy practices relating to job applicants, employees and other personnel.

Region-Specific Disclosures

We may choose or be required by law to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal information about residents of certain countries, regions or states. Please refer below for disclosures that may be applicable to you.

What is Personal Information?

When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to you.

Our Collection of Personal Information

From the first moment you interact with us, we are collecting personal information about you. Sometimes we collect personal information automatically when you interact with our services, and sometimes we collect the personal information directly from you. At times, we may collect personal information about you from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction.

**Personal Information You Provide**

We collect the following personal information you provide in connection with our services:

* **Contact information.** We may receive information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, username, and password when you communicate with us through the services, contact Customer Service, create an account, sign up to our marketing emails, enter a contest or sweepstakes, respond to a survey, or otherwise communicate with us. We may also collect any communications between you and Polywork, and any other information you provide to us.
* **Profile Information.** When you create a profile, you are able to provide us with information such as your education, work experience, gender, salary, and employment status, skills, social account URLs, profile photo, and biography. Profile information is optional. **Please be aware that your Profile information will be viewable by other users and visitors to the service and may also be viewable through public search or on third-party sites that you use**.
* **User Content and Interactions through the Services.** We collect information about how you use the services, your actions on the services, and content you post to the services, including the groups you belong to, your interaction with your connections on the services, photos and videos you post to the services, portfolio examples, comments on blog posts or reviews of our products, and any content you provide including through emails, in-app messages, chat, or other functionality ("User Content"). To share photos and video, we will access your device camera roll and camera with your permission. If you need to update your permissions, you can do so in the "Settings" app of your device.
* **Comments, Suggestion, Chat and Opinions.** When you contact us directly, e.g. by email, phone, mail or by completing an online form or participating in online chat, we will record your comments and opinions. We will also record comments and opinions you express when responding to surveys, entering a sweepstakes or taking part in promotions we run.
* **Address Book Information.** With your permission, Polywork may access your contact list available on your mobile device or your email accounts so that you can locate your contacts on the services and invite your contacts to connect with our services. When we send the invitation to join the services, we will include your name and photo to let them know that you are the person extending the invitation. After sending these invitations, we may also send reminder emails to your invitees on your behalf, which may also include your name and photo.

**Personal Information Automatically Collected**

As is true of most digital platforms, we collect certain personal information automatically when you visit our online services, including:

* **Log File Data**, including your internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser ID, device ID, date/time of visit, and pages visited.
* **Analytics Data** including the electronic path you take to our services, through our services and when exiting our services, as well as your usage and activity on our services, such as the links and objects you view, click or otherwise interact with (also known as “Clickstream Data”).
* **Location Data**, including your general geographic location based on your IP address or more precise location when accessing our online services through a mobile device.

**Cookies and other Technology:** Please note that we do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals. For information about our and our third-party partners’ use of cookies and related technologies to collect information automatically, and any choices you may have in relation to its collection, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.polywork.com/cookies).

**Personal Information from Other Sources and Third Parties**

We also obtain personal information from other sources, which we often combine with personal information we collect either automatically or directly from you. We receive the same categories of personal information as described above from the following sources and third parties:

* **Business Partners**, such as promotional partners, collect personal information and often share some or all of this information with us. For example, we receive personal information from our partners to coordinate events, identify prospective customers, and conduct marketing.
* **Service Providers**, such as analytics providers and promotional partners, collect personal information and often share some or all of this information with us. For example, we receive personal information from service providers to understand analytics activities, facilitate survey activities, and prevent, investigate or provide notice of fraud or unlawful or criminal activity.
* **Data Providers**, such as when we purchase or otherwise obtain lists or data from third-party list or data providers, distribution partners, or marketing firms, to correct or supplement personal information we collect. For example, we may obtain demographic personal information from third-party data providers to better understand the products and services that may interest you and, with your permission, to supplement your profile information. We may combine this information with the information we collect from you directly.
* **Other Polywork Entities**, including other Polywork companies, businesses, brands and affiliated entities in our family of companies, so that information you provide to one brand may be used by another brand to provide you services or to communicate with you.
* **Social Networks**, when you interact with us through a social media site or third-party service, such as when you like, follow or share Polywork content on Slack, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, or other sites. We may receive information from the social network including your profile information, picture, user ID associated with your social media account, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties.
* **Authentication Services You Connect to our Services**, as some parts of our services may allow you to login through a third-party social network or authentication service such as Slack, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, which could include your name, email address, address book and contacts, or other information. The data we receive is dependent on that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site.
* **Publicly Available Sources**, through which we collect personal information about you that we do not otherwise have, including contact information, employment related information and product interest information, from publicly available sources. We may combine this information with the information we collect from you directly.

Our Use of Personal Information

We may use personal information we collect to:

* Process your registration on our services, including verifying your information to ensure its accuracy and validity.
* Fulfill your requests (e.g., to provide you with information that you request).

* Operate, maintain and provide to you the features and functionality of the services.
* Send you important information regarding the services, such as certain changes to our terms, conditions, policies and/or other administrative information. Because this information may be material to your use of the services, you may not “opt out” of receiving such communications.
* Inform you of products, programs, services, and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you, including, without limitation, adding you to our email/mailing lists and permitting you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions.

* Provide certain features or services that you have consented to (you may withdraw your consent for some uses of the data at any time by contacting us at the information provided below).

* Fulfill the purposes disclosed at the time you provide your personal data or as otherwise set forth in this Notice.
* Monitor, record, and store User Content in order to protect your safety or the safety of other users, to assist with regulatory or law enforcement efforts, or to protect and defend our rights and property. By using the services, you consent to the recording, storage and disclosure of such communications you send or receive for these purposes.

If you choose to contact us, we may need additional information to fulfill your request or respond to your inquiry. We may provide additional privacy disclosures where the scope of the inquiry/request and/or personal information we require fall outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy disclosures will govern how we may process the information you provide at that time.

Our Disclosure of Personal Information

Our services allow you to share information about yourself with other individuals and other companies, including other users and potential users of the services or other products or services offered by Polywork and third-party Social Networking Sites. **Please note that Information on your profile is viewable by other users or visitors to our services and may also be viewable through public search or on third-party sites that you use.** We do not control who reads the information you share or what others may do with this information, so we encourage you to use discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Also, when sharing information about others, please consider their safety and privacy and get their consent for that sharing.

We may also disclose personal information in the following ways:

* **Within Polywork.** We are able to offer you the products and services we make available because of the hard work of our team members across all the Polywork entities, so our team members may have access to your information in the course of performing their job duties.

If you have chosen to do this, your data will be governed by the privacy policy of that social network.

**Data Retention**

We retain personal data about you for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in these Disclosures, unless a longer period is required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.

The criteria used to determine the period for which personal data about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal data:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Legitimate Interests | Where we are processing personal data based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects |

| Contract | Where we are processing personal data based on contract, we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship |
| Legal Obligation | Where we are processing personal data based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfill the legal obligation |
| Legal Claim | We may need to apply a “legal hold” that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved. |

In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data.

International Data Transfers

We may transfer personal data about you among us and to our subsidiaries or affiliates, as well as to the categories of third parties identified in the Our Disclosure of Personal Information section of the Notice. Personal data may be transferred to, stored and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including, but not limited to, the United States. The country to which personal data is transferred may not provide the same level of protection for personal data as the country from which it was transferred.

We may transfer personal data about you outside the EEA or the UK, and when we do so, we rely on appropriate or suitable safeguards recognized under the EU GDPR and UK GDPR, including adequacy decisions and standard contractual clauses.

**Adequacy Decisions**

We may transfer personal data about you to countries that the European Commission or the Information Commissioner, as applicable, has deemed to adequately safeguard personal data.
