Terms of Service

Last Updated: Sep 12, 2023

Welcome to Polywork, the website and online and/or mobile service of Kalo Industries, Inc. d/b/a Polywork (“Company,” “Polywork,” “we,” “our” or “us”). These Terms of Service form an agreement (the “Agreement”) between Company and you, and the Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to your use of our website, and your purchase or use of our products or services (each, a “Service” and collectively, the “Services”), as further described herein. The terms “you” and “your” herein shall refer to the entity or individual that accepts this Agreement or purchases or uses any Services. By accessing, using or purchasing any Services, or by clicking a button or checking a box marked “I Agree” (or something similar), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement, our [Community Guidelines](https://www.polywork.com/community-guidelines), and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in our Privacy Policy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Services. Company reserves the right to modify this Agreement, and Company will provide notice of these changes as described below. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access, use or purchase any Services (“Users”).

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

1. Our Service
    1. Eligibility
        
        This is a contract between you and Company. You must read and agree to these terms before purchasing or using any Company Services. If you do not agree, you may not use or purchase any Services. You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with Company, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or access to any Services by anyone under the Minimum Age is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. Minimum Age means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for Polywork to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Unless an exception is granted by the Company in its sole discretion, the Services are not available to any Users previously removed from the Services by Company. You agree that, unless we state otherwise, English will be the language for all transactions and interactions arising out of this Agreement.
        
        Third-Party Services and Terms. We may make available to you the ability to use or purchase additional Services (each, a “Third-Party Service”) provided by our partners or other third parties (each, a “Third Party”) from us or directly from the Third Party. Third Parties may have their own terms, conditions and policies (collectively, “Third-Party Terms”), and you agree that it’s your obligation to review and abide by those Third-Party Terms (in addition to this Agreement). You acknowledge and agree that we do not control Third-Party Services and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable to you or any other person or entity for any problems or damages arising out of or relating to your use of a Third-Party Service, including, but not limited to, any Third Party’s action or inaction related to any Third-Party Services or decision to suspend or terminate any Third-Party Services.
        
        In addition to any other applicable Third-Party Terms that may apply from time to time, you acknowledge and agree that the following Third-Party Terms apply and you will comply with them for the following specified Services:
        
        Domain Name Registration Services: We act as a reseller to Tucows Domains Inc., an ICANN accredited domain name registrar, and we may provide you with the ability to apply for, register and maintain domain names registered through Tucows. If you use our Services to apply for, register, maintain or take any other action with regard to any domain names, you agree that, in addition to this Agreement, you are bound by and you will comply with the following Master Domain Registration Agreement required by Tucows located at: https://www.opensrs.com/wp-content/uploads/Tucows\_ExhibitA.html (the “Domain Name Agreement”). Note that we are the “Reseller” for purposes of the Domain Name Agreement. Please review the Domain Name Agreement and all Third-Party Terms of other parties referenced in the Domain Name Agreement, such as Third-Party Terms related to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the relevant top-level domain registries, including but not limited to ICANN’s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy located on ICANN’s website at https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2012-02-25-en.
        
        SSL Certificates: As a part of our Services, we may assist you with provisioning an SSL certificate for your domain name. “Let’s Encrypt” certificates are subject to and governed by Third-Party Terms found on Internet Security Research Group’s website located at: https://letsencrypt.org/, including but not limited to their web page containing their policy and legal repository: https://letsencrypt.org/repository/. ZeroSSL certificates are subject to and governed by Third-Party Terms found on ZeroSSL GmbH’s website located at: https://zerossl.com/, including but not limited to their web page containing their terms and conditions: https://zerossl.com/terms/. You agree that you are bound by and will comply with the Third-Party Terms of the applicable issuer of your SSL certificates, as they may be modified from time to time.
        
    2. Limited License
        
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, your payment of all applicable fees), you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, freely revocable right and license to access and use our Services for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Services. Company reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Services and the Company Content (as defined below). Company may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason, as described further below.
        
    3. User Accounts
        1. Your Account
            
            We may require you to establish a user account with us for some or all of our Services (a “User Account”). Your User Account gives you access to certain Services that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of Users. If you open a User Account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (i) “you” includes you and that entity, and (ii) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to Company with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.
            
            You are not permitted to use another User’s User Account without permission. When creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible and liable for the activity that occurs on your User Account (including, but not limited to, all purchases made through your User Account), and you must keep your User Account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols, and are at least 12 characters long) with your User Account. You must notify Company immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized access to or use of your password or other authentication credentials or User Account. Company will not be liable for any losses, damages or charges caused by any unauthorized use of your User Account. If you no longer wish to use our Services, you may request by email to legal@polywork.com that the Company delete your account, or you may delete your profile yourself using the profile settings within your User Account.
            
        2. Consent to Contact You
            
            By providing Company your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Services-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. For example, you agree that we may use your email address to send you notices concerning our Services (including but not limited to termination, suspension, pricing or feature updates, and Agreement updates). You also agree that we may use your email address to provide you with information we believe may be of interest to you, including but not limited to, promotional and marketing messages (e.g., new Services, new features and special offers) and other notices pertaining to our Services. If you do not want to receive such promotional or marketing email messages, you may opt out by using the “unsubscribe” link in any emails we send you, or by sending an email to [legal@polywork.com](mailto:legal@polywork.com) requesting to opt out, or by modifying your notification preferences in your User Account. Opting out may prevent you from receiving such promotional and marketing email messages, but please note that we may still send you emails with information about your account or any Services you are using.
            
        3. Storage Limits
            
            You agree to abide by any storage limitations associated with our Services as specified by us on our website. Even if a Service is referred to as having “unlimited storage,” and regardless of any storage limitations being noted on our website, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) our Services do not serve, and you will not use our Services, as your backup or archive for information or data, (ii) we have no obligation to backup any of your information or data, (iii) you will keep a copy of all information and data that is important to you, and (iv) if your usage of our Services adversely affects other Users’ experience with or use of our Services (including, but not limited to, the amount of storage you use), we may suspend or terminate your Services without liability.
            
    4. Changes to the Service, Cancellation & Termination
        1. Changes to Services
            
            We may, without prior notice, change any Services; stop providing Services (or features of any Services) to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Services (collectively, “Service Changes”). You agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such Service Changes and that your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of any such Service Changes.
            
        2. Suspension and Termination by Us
            
            We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend this Agreement, your account, or your access to the Services without notice and liability for any reason, including, but not limited to, (1)(i) if, in our sole determination, you violate any provision of this Agreement, or we believe your use of our Services could expose us to legal liability in any jurisdiction, (ii) to protect the integrity and stability of our systems or the systems of a Third Party, (iii) for fraud and abuse detection or prevention efforts, (iv) to comply with a court order or requests from law enforcement, (v) to comply with any of our obligations imposed by any Third Party, (vi) to defend against any actual or threatened legal action, (vii) in response to complaints from others related to your use of any of our Services, or (viii) for any other reason expressly provided herein (a “for Cause” suspension or termination), or (2)(i) for no reason (a “for Convenience” suspension or termination).
            
        3. Cancellation or Termination by You
            
            You may cancel any Services or terminate this Agreement at any time by providing us with notice to [legal@polywork.com](mailto:legal@polywork.com) or as otherwise permitted by us in your User Account. If you’d prefer, you may use the cancellation form available via [this link](https://forms.gle/f6f3LLksfWozUYwq8) on our Website.
            
        4. Effect of Termination
            
            All cancellations and terminations are subject to our [Cancellation and Refund Policy](https://polyworkhq.zendesk.com/knowledge/articles/16736917748123/en-us?brand_id=1260802898569) in effect at the time of your purchase or renewal (please take a moment now to review that policy). Upon termination or cancellation for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by the terms of this Agreement with respect to all obligations, liabilities and responsibilities that arose prior to termination. You acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly provided otherwise in our [Cancellation and Refund Policy](https://polyworkhq.zendesk.com/knowledge/articles/16736917748123/en-us?brand_id=1260802898569), (i) if you cancel any Services or terminate this Agreement (for any reason or no reason) or if we terminate any Services or this Agreement for Cause, you will not receive any refund of fees paid for any terminated Services (and all fees owed must still be paid), and (ii) if we terminate any Service or this Agreement for Convenience, your sole and exclusive remedy for such termination is a prorated refund of any prepaid fees for Services not yet provided by us. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or on our website, we will cease charging your Payment Method for any monthly subscription fees as of the expiration of the billing cycle in which the termination is effective. Upon termination of any Services or this Agreement, all licenses granted to you for the terminating Services or under this Agreement, as applicable, will immediately cease, you must cease using the terminated Services, and you must destroy all copies of Company Content (as defined below). You agree that upon termination of this Agreement, we may delete all information related to you on our Services.
            
    5. Fees, Payments and Renewals
        1. Your Obligation to Pay Fees and Taxes
            
            You agree to pay us all applicable fees as designated on our website for the Services you order or as designated by us in the ordering process. All fees for any order you place are subject to change at the time of any renewal or as otherwise provided herein. All fees are due immediately and are non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, on our website at the time of your purchase, or as required by law. You are responsible for payment of all applicable taxes (other than taxes based on our income), including, but not limited to, sales tax, use tax, value added tax, and other taxes and governmental charges and duties on your purchase of Services (collectively, “Taxes”). You agree to pay all Taxes related to the Services or payments made by you hereunder. All fees for Services are listed, and shall be paid, in U.S. dollars.
            
        2. Payment Method
            
            Payments for Services are to be made via a charge to your credit card, debit card or other payment method acceptable to us (your “Payment Method”) as collected and processed by our third-party payment processor, Stripe, Inc. (the “Processor”). You acknowledge and agree that your submission of your Payment Method will be directly to our Processor, that we do not collect your credit card or other financial account information, and you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions with our Processor in connection with your payment of fees for Services. You are solely responsible for ensuring your Payment Method is up to date with our Processor. By submitting an order for Services, you authorize Company and Processor to charge the applicable fees using your Payment Method.
            
        3. Subscriptions Automatically Renew
            
            You agree that all annual and monthly subscriptions and any other recurring fees related to any Services will be recurring transactions billed on an ongoing basis using your Payment Method until the Services are canceled or the Agreement is terminated in accordance with this Agreement. Any Service purchased on a month-to-month basis (a “Monthly Subscription”) will automatically renew each month at the then-current fees applicable to the Service as listed on our website until terminated as provided in this Agreement. Any Service purchased on an annual basis (an “Annual Subscription”) will automatically renew at the end of each 12-month period for additional one-year periods at the then-current fees applicable to the Service as listed on our website until terminated as provided in this Agreement. Any renewal of your Services is subject to the then-current version of this Agreement and payment of all applicable fees. Except in connection with Monthly Subscriptions or as otherwise required by law, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of an upcoming renewal of your Services prior to the renewal date. For Annual Subscriptions, you agree that we and our Processor may charge your Payment Method for each renewal on a date that is no more than thirty (30) days prior to the renewal date. You agree that we or our Processor may extend the expiration date (using third-party services for such purposes) on your Payment Method on file with our Processor in order to effect a renewal.
            
        4. Domain Name Services Fees & Auto-Renewal
            
            You can register domains for as low as $12.50 per year. Domain pricing is dependent on the domain's top-level domain (TLD). To find the price for a domain, you can search for it on the domain name settings page. Unless stated otherwise in our [Cancellation and Refund Policy](https://polyworkhq.zendesk.com/knowledge/articles/16736917748123/en-us?brand_id=1260802898569), domain name fees are non-refundable. We will provide an “auto-renewal” feature to automatically renew certain types of domain names, and you acknowledge and agree that we are authorized to turn on the auto-renewal feature for any eligible domains you register through our Services. You can also turn on or turn off the auto-renewal feature in your account. If you or we turn on the auto-renewal feature for your domain name, we will attempt to renew your domain name prior to the renewal date using your Payment Method, and you agree that we and our Processor are authorized to charge your Payment Method for the renewal at the then-current price for the renewal of the domain name listed on our website. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of an upcoming renewal of your domain name registration prior to the renewal date; however, you acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for ensuring that your domain name is renewed prior to expiration, without regard to whether or not you are using any “auto-renewal” feature. Some domain names are not eligible for the “auto-renewal” feature, so it is important that you check your account and ensure that all domain names you want to renew are renewed prior to the end of the current registration term. Any renewal of a domain name registration is subject to the then-current version of this Agreement and payment of all applicable fees. Unless stated otherwise on our website, we or our third-party domain registrar will endeavor to send you pre- and post-expiration notices via email (on or about 30 days and 5 days prior to, and 3 days after, expiration of a domain name). If you do not wish to renew a domain name, you must ensure that the “auto-renewal” feature is turned off at least 30 days before the renewal date.
            
        5. Payment Method Failure
            
            If your Payment Method fails or is rejected for any reason in connection with a renewal (a “Failed Payment”), you agree that we may, but shall not be obligated to, (i) notify you by email to permit you to update your Payment Method information, and (ii) make additional attempts to charge your Payment Method for the applicable renewal fees. You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a Failed Payment we will terminate the applicable Services as of the end of the paid subscription or registration term or the end of any then-applicable grace period provided by us (as designated by us on our website or confirmed to you in writing), whichever is later. You agree to be responsible and reimburse us for all fees we incur due to a Failed Payment. We may, but shall not be obligated to, change any of your Services to any “free” version of our Services after terminating any fee-based Services due to a Failed Payment, and you agree that your use of any Services after any such termination is governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
            
    6. Disputes with Other Users
        
        You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users, and you must abide by the [Community Guidelines](https://www.polywork.com/community-guidelines). We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Company shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.
        
    7. Service Location
        
        The Services are controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. You acknowledge and agree that you are accessing and entering into this Agreement as hosted by us on our servers in the United States. Company makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Services if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.
        
2. User Content
    
    Some areas of the Services allow Users to submit, post, display, provide, or otherwise make available content (or links to such content) such as profile information, videos, images, music, comments, questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, provides, or otherwise makes available on the Services is referred to as “User Content”).
    
    WE CLAIM NO OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OVER USER CONTENT CREATED BY YOU. THE USER CONTENT YOU CREATE REMAINS YOURS. However, you understand that certain portions of the Services may allow other Users to view, share, and/or otherwise interact with your User Content. By providing or sharing User Content through the Services, you agree to allow others to view, share, and/or interact with your User Content in accordance with this Agreement. Company has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Services.
    
    By submitting, posting, displaying, providing, or otherwise making available any User Content on or through the Services, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Company a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Services and Company’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each User of the Services a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Services, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Services and under this Agreement.
    
    For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.
    
    In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:
    
    * You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content, if any, to use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Services and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use.
    * You have obtained and are solely responsible for obtaining all consents as may be required by law to post any User Content relating to third parties.
    * Your User Content and Company’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Services will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.
    * Company may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.
    * To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.
    
    Company takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third-party posts, sends, or otherwise makes available over the Services. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing it, sharing it, or otherwise making it available on the Services, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Company shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of or relating to any User Content.
    
    Our “Opportunities” feature is designed to allow Users to post information about professional and other collaboration opportunities (each, an “Opportunity”) they are making available (e.g., looking for a guest on a podcast, looking for beta testers, looking to fill a full-time position, etc.) and to communicate directly with one another concerning Opportunities.
    
    Our “Collaboration” feature is designed to allow Users to post information about the types of collaboration they are open to considering (“Collaboration Availability”), and to communicate directly with one another concerning Collaboration Availability and potential collaboration projects (e.g., guest lecturing, providing resume feedback, full time employment, etc.). Users must have an account with Polywork to post an Opportunity or Collaboration Availability, and to use the Services to communicate directly with a User who has posted an Opportunity or Collaboration Availability; however, posted Opportunities and Collaboration Availability can be viewed and shared by all Users (which, please remember, includes visitors to the Services). A User with a Polywork account can use the Services to send a direct message to a User who has posted an Opportunity or Collaboration Availability, and the posting User can decide whether or not to respond to the message. Subject to compliance with this Agreement, the two Users may continue using the Services to communicate about the Opportunity or Collaboration Availability.
    
    PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL INFORMATION YOU POST ON THE SERVICES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROFILE INFORMATION, PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND COLLABORATION PREFERENCES) WILL BE VIEWABLE BY OTHER USERS AND MAY ALSO BE VIEWABLE THROUGH PUBLIC SEARCH OR ON THIRD-PARTY SITES THAT YOU USE, SO PLEASE USE DISCRETION AND CAUTION WHEN POSTING ANY INFORMATION AND WHEN USING THE SERVICES TO CONNECT, COMMUNICATE OR COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS. We do not control who will see the information you post or what they might do with that information or any messages you send. We also do not control what messages other Users might send to you in response to anything you have posted. You are solely responsible for all content you make available through the Opportunities or Collaboration features or other Services (including, but not limited to, any job descriptions, trademarks, images and other information), and you agree to follow all applicable laws and regulations in connection with any Opportunities or Collaboration Availability, or other User Content or communications, you post, respond to or engage in. YOU ARE ALSO SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECIDING WHETHER TO COMMUNICATE, COLLABORATE OR ENGAGE WITH ANY OTHER USERS, AND YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS RELATED TO DOING SO. Also, remember, you must abide by our [Community Guidelines](https://www.polywork.com/community-guidelines) when using the Services or any of its features. Users have the right to report other users should they fail to do so.
    
    We reserve the right to disable, limit or delete your account or remove some or all of your User Content if we believe that you have violated this Agreement (which includes the Community Guidelines) or if we believe that you have misused the Services in any way or if we believe your use of the Services could harm our brand, the value of the Services or other Users’ enjoyment of the Services. In addition to your other obligations under this Agreement, you agree that you will not, and you will not assist or authorize any other party to, do any of the following in connection with the Services:
    
    * Copy, scrape, publish or otherwise reproduce content from another party’s website, or post content pertaining to another party, without that party’s prior authorization;
    * Post or send any misleading, deceptive, harassing, defamatory, objectionable, infringing or unlawful content, or use the Services to engage or attempt to engage in any misleading, deceptive, harassing, defamatory, objectionable, infringing or unlawful activity;
    * Share or otherwise use another User’s information without that User’s express permission;
    * Use our Services to contact a User who has posted an Opportunity or Collaboration Availability for any purposes other than those legitimately related to the particular Opportunity or Collaboration Availability;
    * Except as expressly authorized by us, use any automated process to access, copy, modify, or acquire any content on Polwork;
    * Post any content that contains malware, spyware or other malicious code, or that otherwise interferes with the operation of the Services or any device or system (of Polywork or any other party);
    * Breach or circumvent, or attempt to breach or circumvent, any security measure of Polywork or any other party;
    
    You agree that we may share your User Content and any information about your account with law enforcement authorities investigating any illegal activity related to your use of our Services, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process.
    
    1. Reserved Usernames
        
        A username may be created by a registered User on Polywork subject to availability and any technical and other limitations set by Polywork. You agree not to create or use a username that infringes or violates the rights of Polywork or any third party. Polywork reserves the right to disallow the use of a username in its sole discretion, and may, in its sole discretion, reserve certain usernames and not permit them to be used by some or all Users. Such reserved usernames may be set aside by us for any reason or no reason at all.
        
    2. Change of a Username by Polywork
        
        Polywork reserves the right to change, disable or delete any already-claimed or in-use username in its sole discretion. In such cases, Polywork will (subject to the terms of this Agreement) make a reasonable effort to provide the User with an opportunity to create an alternative username. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that we reserve the right to change, disable or delete your username, without notice, if a third party claims that your username or your use of our Services infringes or violates the rights (including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights) of a third party.
        
    3. Verified Profiles cannot change their Username

    4. Registering or Connecting a Domain Name
        1. Registration through our Services
            
            If you register a domain name through our Services (which includes any purchase of a domain name from a third-party other than Tucows), we will use reasonable efforts to submit your request for a domain name to and through our third-party registrar, Tucows. Upon any successful registration of a domain name, you will be the “registrant” (sometimes referred to as the domain holder or domain owner) for the domain name, which means, among other things, you will be solely responsible and liable for the domain name and how it is used. If you register a domain name through our Services, we may list our company as your billing contact for the domain name. Subject to your payment of all fees owed to us for the domain name and any renewals, we will, during the term of this Agreement, make payment to Tucows to maintain your domain name registration. You acknowledge and agree that a domain name you register through us can and will only point to a website you have set up through our Services (whether a free website or a monthly or annual subscription website). If you wish to use any such domain name for another purpose, or if you no longer maintain a website through our Services, you will be required to establish an individual retail account directly with Tucows or another accredited registrar for continued support of the domain name, and those providers might charge you additional fees for such services.
            
        2. Pointing to Your User Content; Contacts
            
            We may also permit you to point your domain name to, or otherwise associate your domain name with, your User Content on our Services, regardless of whether you use our Services to register your domain name (“Your Domain Name”). We may permit you to list us as one of your domain name contacts other than the billing contact in the domain name registration record (e.g., administrative contact or technical contact) to allow us to perform certain functions on your behalf in connection with the domain name. You agree to respond promptly to all email communications we send to you concerning Your Domain Name. You agree that we are authorized to take any action, and we shall not be liable to you or any other person for any action we take, that we deem reasonably necessary or appropriate as a contact for Your Domain Name.
            
        3. Representations, Use and Disputes
            
            You represent and warrant that you have all rights and permissions necessary to register and use Your Domain Name and that Your Domain Name does not and will not infringe the Intellectual Property Rights or other rights of the Company or any other person or entity (whether alone or in combination with your User Content). You agree that we have the right, in our sole discretion, to (i) remove our information and cease acting as a contact for Your Domain Name, and (ii) to deactivate, suspend or remove any and all content and block Your Domain Name from pointing to or accessing any content on our Services, if we believe, or if we receive any notification from any person or entity alleging, that your User Content or Your Domain Name infringe any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights or violate any applicable laws or our [Community Guidelines](https://www.polywork.com/community-guidelines). You acknowledge that you will not receive a refund of any fees paid or owed in connection with any such action on our part, and all fees will continue to accrue and be charged to your Payment Method until this Agreement is terminated as provided in this Agreement. If Your Domain Name is subject to any dispute or claim by a third-party, you agree that we may provide information about Your Domain Name and the registration record to third-parties associated with the dispute or claim, including but not limited to the claimant, ICANN and any dispute tribunal, arbitrator or government agency. You agree we are not responsible for taking any action on your behalf in connection with any dispute or claim. You agree not to use any automated processes or scripts in connection with our Services or any Third-Party Services.
            
        4. Registrar and Related Parties
            
            You acknowledge and agree that we do not control the domain name registrar or registry associated with Your Domain Name, and we shall have no liability to you or anyone else for any act or omission by any registrar or registry, including but not limited to mistakes by any of them or decisions by any of them to suspend or terminate Your Domain Name or related services. Please take a moment to review ICANN’s Registrants Education Materials at: https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/educational-2012-02-25-en and ICANN’s Registrant Rights and Benefits page at: https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/benefits-2013-09-16-en, as well as all Registrant-related terms, conditions and policies of the specific top-level domain registry for Your Domain Name (available on the top-level domain registry’s website). You agree that the top-level domain registry terms, conditions and policies applicable to registrants apply to Your Domain Name. You acknowledge and agree that our third-party registrar, Tucows, may contact you directly by email concerning new or changed policies or codes of practice.

        We may provide you with sample information and descriptions (“Sample Descriptions”) to help you get started with creating your personalized online biography. Sample Descriptions provided to you may be the same as or similar to the Sample Descriptions we provide to other Users. The Sample Descriptions may not be accurate or appropriate descriptions of you or your bio. You agree to review all Sample Descriptions carefully and make all changes necessary to ensure the information you use for your online bio is accurate and appropriate.

Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
