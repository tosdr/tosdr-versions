### 10\. Service Level Agreements (SLA)

we commit to ensuring the following Service levels:  
(a) GE-OPENVZ\* Services:  
Monthly availability rate: 97.5%  
(b) All Other Services:  
Monthly availability rate: 99.95%  
“Monthly availability rate” should be understood as: the total number of minutes in the month considered as a deduction made from the number of minutes of unavailability over the month concerned. The total is divided by the total number of minutes in the month.  
“Unavailability” should be understood to mean: the loss of access to and inability to reboot the VPS, for more than three (3) consecutive minutes from the moment an Incident ticket has been opened by the Customer.  
  
The Service level agreements made above are subject to the exclusions below, and on the conditions that in the event of unavailability the Customer shall collaborate with us to reestablish the Service.  
This agreement does not in any way concern the availability of elements that are under the Customer’s control, such as software or applications installed on the VPS and used by the Customer.  
This service level agreement is not applicable in the event that we are unable to perform the technical operations required to check the service state due to the Customer’s configuration of their VPS.  
If we confirms that a VPS is available and in good working order, we are released from the obligation under the SLA. However, in this case, upon the Customer’s request, we agrees to assist them in identifying the cause of the issues found by the Customer.  
If we identify an Unavailability, we complete the diagnostic and works in collaboration with the Customer to reestablish availability.  
  
If the service level set out above is not reached, the Customer can request the following credits :  
• Unfulfilled availability rate:  
(a) GE-OPENVZ\* Services:  
Credit equal to 10% of the monthly amount paid by the Customer for the month during which the components were affected by the Unavailability, if the availability rate identified is equal or lower than 97.5%.  
(b) All Other Services:  
Credit equal to 10% of the monthly amount paid by the Customer for the month during which the components were affected by the Unavailability, if the availability rate identified is equal or lower than 99.5%.  
It is expressly agreed that for the Customer, the aforementioned credits represent a flat-rate compensation for any damage resulting from our non-compliance with the relevant service commitments. As a result, the Customer renounces the right to submit any other request, demand and/or action.  
If an incident results in our side failing to comply with several commitments in the Service Level Agreement, the credits cannot be accumulated. When credit compensation is applied, it is provided as generously as possible to the Customer. Furthermore, the total accumulated compensation able to be attributed over the course of a month for all incidents combined cannot exceed 100% of the total monthly amount billed to the Customer.  
  
The Customer cannot under any circumstances use this article and request the aforementioned credit compensation in the event of unavailability resulting in full or in part from:

1. events or factors outside of the our control including but not limited to cases of force majeure, third parties, downtime or incorrect usage of hardware or software under the Customer’s management (particularly the applications run on the VPS);
2. failure on the Customer’s part to fulfil the obligations listed as part of this Contract (in particular, failure to collaborate in resolving the incident); (iii) incorrect or inappropriate usage of the Service by the Customer;
3. scheduled maintenance;
4. an interruption that falls under the conditions listed in the “Terms and Conditions of Use” article in this document;
5. hacking or piracy.

### 11\. Fair usage policy

Some resources are subject to a fair-usage rule and this means that it is forbidden to abuse, we are very large with quantities and do not set a real limit but when the action of a customer can also create problems for other people in the same node/network this violates the fair use policy.  
Except in rare cases we will contact you before taking any action on your service or account and we will ask you for explanations and if the abuse is caused by excessive use of resources (e.g. network bandwidth) and you requires this massive use we will arrange a solution for you.  
  
We reserve the right to suspend any service without prior notice if the abuse vastness is excessive.
