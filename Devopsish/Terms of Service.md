Additional Sponsorship Terms and Conditions
-------------------------------------------

The right to refuse sponsorship from anyone for any reason is reserved.

Sponsors may not place restrictions on the content or format of the newsletter in any way.

Subscriber demographic data outside of what’s shared on devopsish.com or in the [DevOps’ish Sponsorship Prospectus](https://shortcdn.com/devopsish/DevOps'ish_Sponsorship_Prospectus.pdf) is not available.

No more than three ads a week will run in the newsletter. Out of cycle/cadence e-mails may or may not feature ads depending on a variety of factors.

### Ad Timing

The newsletter is typically sent on Sundays at 0700 UTC. There may be weeks where due to life circumstances, travel, or timezone differences the newsletter is sent a day earlier or a day later but this is the exception not the rule.

Rates can change based on supply, demand, and subscribers. Rates should not change more than once a quarter or four times a year.

### Ad Format

Your ad will be featured _natively_ in e-mails to all subscribers and on [devopsish.com](https://devopsish.com/). The native ad format guards against content blockers while maintaining the quality experience subscribers expect. It also eliminates a lot of headaches with regards to formatting.

Ads include a headline, additional copy, links as specified, and are followed by the italicized word, _SPONSORED_. Total ad copy length excluding headline, call to action, and _SPONSORED_ tag should not exceed 280 characters.

💡Think of ads in DevOps’ish as a tweet with a bolded headline on top and a call to action. 💡
