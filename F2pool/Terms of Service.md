Due to the recent development in local regulation, we will no longer be able to provide you with mining pool services. Your pending payout will be safe, and the final payout will be sent automatically as usual. If you have not filled in the payout address, please do so before 2021-12-30. We plan to shut down our services in mainland China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, by 2021-12-31 16:00 UTC. Please contact us with supporting documents if our system incorrectly identifies your country of origin.
