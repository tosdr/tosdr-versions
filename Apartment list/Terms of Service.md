**Apartment List Terms of Use**
-------------------------------

Last Updated: October 12, 2020 

Welcome to [www.apartmentlist.com](https://www.apartmentlist.com/), as operated by Apartment List, Inc. (“**Company**” or “**we**”). Our website and mobile applications allow companies to list apartments, houses or other real estate for rent or sale and individuals to locate such properties for rent or sale (collectively the "**Service**"). Company makes this Service available to users of the Service subject to these terms of use (the "**Terms**"). These Terms represent a legal contract between you, a user of the Service seeking properties for rent or sale (“**you**”), and Company, regarding your access to and use of the Service. 

1. **Acceptance of the Terms**

**Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use the Service. By using the Service, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms, our Privacy Policy** **and any additional posted guidelines, rules and terms applicable to specific services, features, and downloadable applications, which may be posted from time to time (collectively, the "Guidelines"). Our Privacy Policy and such Guidelines are incorporated by reference into these Terms.**

**If you do not agree to these Terms, the Privacy Policy or the Guidelines, you must not access or use the Service.** 

2. **Consent to Auto-Dialed Text Messages and Phone Calls.**  

You agree that Company and Company’s business customers (e.g., property managers and landlords) may contact you by autodialed, pre-recorded or artificial voice text messages and phone calls with information about the Service, your account, and marketing messages, even if your phone number is on a do-not-call list.  You are not required to provide this consent as a condition of purchasing anything or using the Service. Message rates and data charges may apply. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. If you have any questions about your text or data plan, it is best to contact your carrier. You may cancel receiving text messages from us at any time. To cancel messages received from property managers or landlords, you must contact them directly. To stop receiving text messages from us, just text “STOP” in response to a text message. After you send a text message “STOP” to us, we will send you a text message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. After this, you will no longer receive text messages from us. If you want to receive text messages from us again, you can email us at [support@apartmentlist.com](mailto:support@apartmentlist.com) or respond to our last text message with a keyword such as “START” or “YES.” If you are experiencing issues with the text messaging program, you can reply with the keyword “HELP” for more assistance, or you can get help directly at support@apartmentlist.com. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to promptly update your account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number.

4. **Changes to these Terms and the Service**

Company may amend these Terms. All changes are effective immediately when we post them. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes. However, any changes to Section 7 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) may not apply if you notify us in accordance with that section. 

We reserve the right to withdraw, amend or discontinue any part of our Service in our sole discretion without notice. The Service may be out of date and Company makes no commitment to update materials on the Service. 

5. **Age and Geographic Restrictions**

The Service is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. By using this Service, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Service.

The owner of the Service is based in the State of California in the United States. We provide this Service for use only by persons located in the United States. We make no claims that the Service or any of its content is accessible or appropriate outside of the United States. Access to the Service may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Service from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk, and you are responsible for compliance with local laws.

6. **Privacy**

Please read the [Privacy Policy](https://www.apartmentlist.com/about/privacy) carefully for details relating to what information and data Company collects from you, and how we use that information and disclose it to third parties. 

7. **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

**Please read the following arbitration provision carefully. It requires you to arbitrate certain disputes with the Company arising out of these Terms, the Service or any other product or service of the Company (“Disputes”) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.**

Both you and Company acknowledge and agree that for purposes of any Dispute, Company’s officers, directors, employees, agents and independent contractors (“**Personnel**”) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, the Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary hereof.

Informal Dispute Resolution.  Before filing a claim against the Company, please contact us at the contact information under Contacting Us. We'll try to resolve the Dispute informally. If a Dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or the Company may bring a formal arbitration proceeding.

We Both Agree To Arbitrate. You and the Company both agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under the exceptions below.

Governing Law of Arbitration Terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, you and the Company agree that these arbitration terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration terms and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and JAMS Rules preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and JAMS Rules are found not to apply to any Disputes that arise under these arbitration terms or the enforcement thereof, then that Dispute is to be resolved under the laws of the state of California.

Procedures of Arbitration: The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules, including the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards. JAMS’s rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. 

Fees for Arbitration: Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Company will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. 

Location of Arbitration: The arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, or the United States county where you live or work, or any other location we agree to. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person.

Arbitration Exceptions: 

* Either the Company or you may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California or any United States county where you live or work. 
* Either the Company or you may bring a lawsuit for injunctive or other equitable relief in San Francisco County, California to prevent threatened or actual misappropriation, violation, or infringement of a party’s intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets.

No Class Actions; No Jury Trial: **Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis. Class arbitrations, class actions, and collective, consolidated or representative actions are not permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING (A) THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND (B) THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS.**

The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, consolidated or representative basis, but only on an individual basis. Other than disputes regarding the validity of the class action waiver contained herein and the exceptions set forth herein, which disputes may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction, all Disputes regarding the scope and validity of these Terms will be resolved by the arbitrator.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would.

One Year to Bring Action. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS) BROUGHT BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO A DISPUTE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

Commencing an Arbitration Proceeding: To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Company at the following address: 

Apartment List, Inc.  
Attention: Legal  
548 Market St, PMB 79519  
San Francisco, CA 94104-5401

or

email: [legal@apartmentlist.com](mailto:legal@apartmentlist.com). 

Severability of Arbitration Terms: If part of these arbitration terms are deemed unenforceable or unlawful, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful term is to be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful term will not impact the remainder of the arbitration terms; and (3) to the extent that any claims must proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, those claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
