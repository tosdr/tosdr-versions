### **Uses of Your Personal Information**

We use your information for these purposes:

**Providing and Supporting the Service.** The Company uses your information to provide to you all of the features and services found on the Service and to connect you with our business customers and other third parties upon your request. We will use your email address for non-marketing or administrative purposes such as notifying you of major Service updates, responding to your requests, contacting winners of our sweepstakes, and sending you other types of notices. We may also use your information to diagnose and fix server problems. We may use your information to process your job application and to contact you about a job. In addition, we may review the content of communications you make through the Service so that we can provide better services. For example, monitoring user communications may help us identify and remove users who are attempting to scam other users or perform other illegal activity.  

**Managing our Relationships with Business Customers and Other Businesses.** We use the reporting information provided by our business customers (i.e., move-in data) in order to match their customers (i.e., renters) against our users.  If we are the source of a business transaction, then we charge our business customer a fee. For example, if you saw a property on our Site for the first time and later signed a lease for that property, then our business customer who manages that property would pay us a fee because we were the original source of that transaction. We may also use the move-in data provided by our business customers for audit purposes and to exercise our rights and defenses with respect to our business customers.  If an individual included in the move-in data from a business customer has not used our Service, we delete that individual’s information. We also use renter data and contact information to provide our leasing agent services (e.g., answering your calls or responding to text messages with your inquiries).

When we use contact information of the professionals who work for our business customers, vendors, or other businesses, we use the information to facilitate the business relationship with the companies.

**Improving the Service.** The Company may use the information that we collect from our users to understand usage trends and preferences, to improve the way the Service works and looks, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, and to create new features and functionality.  We may also track your use of the Services to improve the design and functionality of the Services.

**Customizing your Experience.** The Company may use your information to remember you when you return to our Site (for example, with cookies) so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site. We may also use your information to provide you with custom, personalized advertisements, content and information through the use of cookies. For example, based on your property preferences, we may tailor the search results that you see on our Service. The Company also uses the location information that you provide or that it collects from your mobile device or IP address, to show you properties that may be of interest to you.

**Analyzing the Service.** The Company may use your information to: (a) monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of users and number and type of pages viewed, (b) track conversion of prospective renters into actual renters of our business customers, (c) perform fraud monitoring and prevention and security, and (d) determining the effectiveness of our Service.

**Marketing the Service.** Where permitted by applicable law, the Company may use your email address or other personal contact information to send you promotional or marketing messages relating to the Service, which you will have the ability to opt-out of.  We use your information to monitor the effectiveness of these promotional and marketing campaigns.

**Third Party Uses.** We may partner with certain third parties to collect other information to engage in analysis, research, and reporting of Service usage patterns. While we endeavor to limit their activities to those of a service provider (e.g., selecting restricted or limited data processing) these third parties may deliver advertising to you on other websites and applications, based on your activity on our website and other websites over time. These third parties may set and access cookies on your computer or other devices and may also use web logs or web beacons. See “**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**” and see “**Your Choices and Opting Out**” to opt out of interest-based advertising by third parties from cookies.

If we combine such information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information as long as it is combined.

**General and Legal Uses.** We may use your information if we believe it is appropriate or necessary: (a) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and that of you and others; (b) to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or is at risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity; (c) to protect our operations and the security of our Services; (d) under applicable law; (e) to comply with legal process and our legal obligations; (f) to respond to requests or requirements from public, law and government authorities (including national security and law enforcement requirements) and private parties; (g) to enforce our terms and conditions; and (h) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
