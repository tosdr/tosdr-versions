    2. Circumstances in which we may suspend or withdraw your account include but are not limited to, our reasonable belief that you have used an account for payment which you are not entitled to use, or you have breached these terms and conditions.
10. **Your liability under the agreement**
    1. You are liable for paying all of the charges in relation to your use of the Services and the App.
    2. You are also liable to pay any fines and / or penalty notices you receive during your use of the Services. We will under no circumstances be liable to you for any loss or damage you may suffer in relation to any parking fines applied by authorities to you in relation to your breach of any Parking Partners rules and regulations, road markings or other relevant legislation.
11. **Our liability to you under this agreement:**
    1. We accept liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence. We also accept liability for fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation by us.
    2. Other than our liability mentioned above, if we breach these terms or are otherwise liable to you for any other type of claim, we shall only be liable to you for losses up to the greater of: a) the amount paid by you to us in relation to the Parking Session giving rise to the dispute between us or b) £100.
    3. We are not responsible for: (i) losses not caused by our breach; (ii) indirect losses (which means loss to you which is a side effect of the main loss or damage, and where you and we could not have reasonably expected that loss would arise at the time of entering into these terms); (iii) any loss arising as a result of the accuracy, timeliness, completeness or usefulness of any information; or (iv) failure to provide the Services or to meet any of our obligations under these terms where such failure is due to events beyond our control (for example a network failure).
    4. You have certain rights under the law. Nothing in these terms (including this section) is intended to or will affect these statutory rights.
12. **Resolving disputes:**
    1. If you have any questions, complaints or comments about us or the services then please contact us via support-uk.justpark.com, or in writing by post to: JustPark, Dunn's Hat Factory, 106 - 110 Kentish Town Road, London, NW1 9PX.
    2. If you breach these terms and we take no action against you, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these terms.
    3. Please contact the Parking Provider if your query or complaint relates to an issue with a Parking Space itself.
13. **General provisions:**
    1. These terms are not intended to give rights to anyone except you and us.
    2. You acknowledge that we may transfer our rights under the terms (and any related claims) to any third party without having to obtain your prior permission.
    3. If any part of these terms is disallowed or found to be ineffective by a court or regulator, the other provisions shall continue to apply.
    4. These terms together with our policies contain all terms agreed between you and us. They replace any prior agreements between you and us in relation to the Services.
    5. You agree that your right to access and use the Services is also subject to applicable law and any rules or policies applied by the relevant App Store from which you access the App.
14. **Governing law and jurisdiction**
    1. These terms are governed by and interpreted in accordance with English law. We both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts, which means: (i) that if you live in the EU, you may enforce your rights in connection with these terms in the EU member state in which you live; or (ii) if you live in any other jurisdiction which gives you mandatory consumer protection rights, you may enforce your rights in connection with the terms in accordance with such rights.
