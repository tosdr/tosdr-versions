=====================

![Car parked with peace of mind](https://static.justpark.com/web/assets/insurance-logo.v1.b32dff16.svg)

Excess refund insurance

Just in case something happens while you’re parked

We worked hard to create a policy that covers your car when parked with us, but as with all policies, some conditions do apply.

Bookings that have been insured with a starting date before January 1st 2022 are administered by [**Allianz Assistance**](https://www.justpark.com/insurance-policy/#Allianz). Bookings that have been insured with a starting date on or after January 1st 2022 are administered by [**ARAG plc**](https://www.justpark.com/insurance-policy/#ARAG). See below for the relevant terms for your provider.

### Eligibility Statement

Before you purchase this Policy and during the **Period of Insurance you** will need to meet each of the following eligibility statements:

* **You** have agreed to purchase Parking Peace of Mind Excess Protection Insurance for **your** vehicle as **you** would like **your** **Excess** reimbursed following a successful claim under **your Motor Insurance Policy** for an incident that happened whilst you were parked in a space rented through JustPark Parking Ltd.
* The insured person under this policy is the individual stated on the **Motor Insurance Policy**.
* **Your** vehicle is a car, van, minibus, or motorcycle.
* **You** have a valid parking session booked through JustPark Parking Ltd for the duration for which this policy provides cover.
