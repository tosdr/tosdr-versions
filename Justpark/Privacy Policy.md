==============

### Introduction

1. JustPark Parking Limited, trading as JustPark ("we" or "us") take the privacy of your information very seriously. This policy explains how and for what purposes we use the information collected about you via our website, apps, pay by phone, pay by SMS and Kiosk (referred to below as "the Service"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. By using the Service you are agreeing to be bound by this policy in respect of the information collected about you via this Site.
2. If you have any queries about the policy, please [get in touch](https://support-uk.justpark.com/) and we will do our best to answer your questions.
3. We review this policy regularly and it is your responsibility to check regularly and determine whether you still agree to comply with the policy. If you do not agree to any changes to this policy then you must immediately stop using the Service. In the event we make any significant changes to this Policy we will use our reasonable endeavours to inform you of such changes in advance in writing.
4. It is important that the personal information we hold about you is true, complete, accurate and current. Accordingly, you must notify us of any changes to your personal information (for example, if you change your email address).
5. The Service is owned and operated by JustPark Parking Limited (trading as “JustPark”), a company registered in England and Wales with company number 05956777 and whose registered office is situated at Dunn's Hat Factory, 106-110 Kentish Town Road London, England, NW1 9PX (JustPark/we/us/our). JustPark is the controller (also known as a data controller) of, and is responsible for, your personal information. The term “you” refers to the user wishing to access and/or use the Services.

### Personal information collected and use of this information

1. Core Account Data - although it is not compulsory to give us this information, if you do not then you cannot register as a member of the Service, or make a booking for a parking space with our parking space operators we will collect the following data.
    1. Name - we need to store this to identify you in the provision of our service. It will be shared with parking space operators you make a booking with and users on our platform which you send messages to.
    2. Email - we’ll send emails to you about your bookings and the JustPark service. We may share your email with third parties (including parking space operators)
    3. Photo - if you upload a photo, we provide it to parking space operators so they can identify you and we use it to personalise any reviews you leave about parking spaces.
    4. Number plate (VRM) - we store this for enforcement purposes, safety purposes, to calculate your emissions and ensure you are parking in the correct parking bay size. We share this with third party enforcement companies and parking space operators along with parking session dates and times, and sometimes your name, subject to terms outlined in separate Data Sharing Agreements held between JustPark and these third party companies outlining each company’s obligations relating to current data protection laws. We also use the VRM to check with the DVSA that a vehicle has a valid MOT certificate at the time of a booking as this is a requirement of some of our space owners to ensure that vehicles parked in their spaces are safe and roadworthy. We may use the VRM to determine the make and model of your vehicle to calculate emissions which may be used to calculate your pricing for parking. The VRM may check the size of your vehicle to ensure that you are parking in the correct size parking space for your booking. The VRM will be used to check against the MOT database. We will log when your MOT is due and send a reminder before the due date. The reminder will also give you the option to book a test with a third party, please note no data will be shared with the third party unless you proceed to make a booking, please check the privacy policy of the third party provider to understand what data they collect and how they use it.
    5. IP Address - this is used by us and some of our third-party providers to identify your device in the provision of our service. It is also used for fraud checks and to ensure a secure product.
    6. Payment method - payment method details you provide (including name, email address and sometimes address) are sent directly to PCI-compliant third party payment providers. They are not stored on JustPark servers and JustPark employees do not have access to these details.
    7. Booking history - we store a history of where and when you’ve booked parking to make repeat use faster and easier for you, and in interest of your and our accounting purposes.
    8. Phone number - we store this so drivers can contact parking space operators and vice versa. Phone numbers are only shared when you’ve made payment for a booking. We also use it to make repeat use of our pay by phone service faster. We may contact you via phone should there be any issues with your bookings or account.
    9. Reviews - if you choose to leave a review for a parking location, this will be shown to other drivers considering booking the space (only showing your first name and the initial of your last name).
    10. Non-JustPark spaces navigated to - we log which of these you launch navigation to in order to make repeat use faster and easier for you, and to improve our parking availability engine - which helps us show you and other drivers when we think spaces will be available to park in.
    11. Location data - if you choose to enable location services, we will occasionally store your location services data to improve our parking availability engine - which helps us show you and other drivers when we think spaces will be available to park in. You can stop this data from being stored by turning off your location services.
    12. Messages - messages you send to other JustPark users about a booking are visible only to that user and to JustPark staff
    13. Third party CRM tools - we send the following data to GDPR compliant Customer Relationship Management tools so that we can communicate with you: name, email, phone number and your customer support messages.

    1. Parking space address - we use this to show drivers where your space is. We only reveal the full address to them after they've paid to park in it so that they can navigate there. Before that the driver can only see the street name and a map pin showing the location of your space.
    2. Space description - this is a public-facing description you provide when adding your space which helps drivers decide if a space is suitable.
    3. Photos of your space - these public-facing photos help drivers decide if a space is suitable and help them access it on arrival.
    4. Facilities - these are public-facing space attributes, which you can optionally provide to help drivers decide if a space is suitable for them.
    5. Access instructions - if you provide these when adding your space, they are used to help drivers access your space. They are not shown to the driver until they have paid to park in your space. Once the parking session has finished, they are hidden from the driver.
    6. PIN code for accessing space - if you provide a pin code (e.g. for a gate) it is given to drivers to help them access your space. It is not shown to the driver until they have paid to park in your space. Once the parking session has finished, it is hidden from the driver.
