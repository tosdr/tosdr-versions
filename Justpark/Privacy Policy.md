In the event we make any significant changes to this policy we will inform you of such changes.
    

### 2\. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USE OF THIS INFORMATION

1. Personal information you provide to us directly:
    
    1. _Account data_ – this includes name, email, phone number, photo, vehicle information (e.g., make, model and number plate/license plate), and, if relevant, company name.
    2. _Payment method_ – payment method details you provide (including payment card information and address) are sent directly to PCI-compliant third party payment providers. They are not stored on our servers and our staff do not have access to these details.
    3. _Booking history and non-JustPark spaces navigated to_ – we store a history of where and when you've booked parking, and non-JustPark spaces you launch navigation to, in order to make repeat use faster and easier for you, for your and our accounting purposes, and to help us determine which spaces will be available to park in.
    4. _Location data_ – if you choose to enable location services, we will store your location services data to improve our parking availability engine - which helps us show you and other drivers when we think spaces will be available to park in. You can stop this data from being stored by turning off your location services.
    5. _Reviews_ – if you choose to leave a review for a parking location, this will be shown to other drivers considering booking the space (only showing your first name and the initial of your last name).
    6. _Messages_ – messages you send to us and other users of our Service.
    7. _Number plate/License plate (VRM)_ – we store this for enforcement purposes, safety purposes, to calculate your emissions and ensure you are parking in the correct parking bay size. We share this with third party enforcement companies and parking space operators along with parking session dates and times, and sometimes your name.
    8. _Parking space listing data_ – to list your parking space with us we will collect information, such as the parking space address, space description, photos of the space, facilities and attributes, and access instructions.

    3. _Public sources and risk prevention databases_, including to check that a vehicle has a valid certificate/registration at the time of a booking to ensure that vehicles are safe and roadworthy and to calculate emissions which may be used to calculate your pricing for parking.

We may also send you reminders before any registrations or testing are due, and we may give you the option to book a test with a third party.
