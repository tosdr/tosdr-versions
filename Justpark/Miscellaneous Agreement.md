### These Terms

1. JustPark Parking Limited (trading as JustPark) ("us", "we" or "JustPark") provides a website and associated services ("Services") connecting those seeking to book parking spaces, charging points or storage spaces for vehicles and bicycles ("Drivers") with our JustPark registered owners who own or operate such parking spaces, charging points or storage spaces ("you" or the "Owners").
2. These terms and conditions will apply at any time when you use this website ("Website") or any other method of accessing the Services (including via the JustPark application). By continuing to use the Website or the Services you accept these terms and conditions and they will apply to the agreement between you and us (the "Agreement").
3. This Agreement governs the relationship between us and you. When you use the Services we are providing you with the means to enter into individual, direct contracts with Drivers to park in your parking space or use your charging point or storage spaces (“Parking Spaces”). When accepting bookings for Parking Spaces using the Services ( “Bookings”) and allowing Drivers to use your Parking Space(s) you are entering into individual, direct contracts with the Drivers. You will be bound by your obligations under this Agreement and any additional obligations included in a listing relating to a Parking Space. We are not a party to the agreement between you and the Driver and we will not be liable to you, the Driver or any third party for any breach of obligations in relation to the Parking Space whether set out in this Agreement, in any listings relating to a Parking Space, Charging Session or otherwise. We simply facilitate the payment between you and the Driver for the use of the Parking Space and/or charging point provided by you.
4. These terms and conditions may be amended from time to time as we continually develop the services we provide. We may amend this Agreement by posting the amended terms and conditions on our website [www.justpark.com/owner-agreement](https://www.justpark.com/owner-agreement).

Any amendments or new terms and conditions will be available on our Website. The terms and conditions on the Website at the time you enter into a Booking for a Parking Space or use any other Services will be the ones that apply. You may terminate this Agreement if you do not wish to be bound by any such amendments but by continuing to use our Website or Services you will be deemed to have accepted the new terms.
5. This Agreement is with you, the person using the Services . You will comply with the terms of this Agreement and any additional requirements in relation to the Parking Space and/or charging point. If you allow another person to assist with managing a Booking or Parking Space you agree you will remain responsible for the Booking and the Parking Space and/or charging point.

Where you elect to use instant booking your Parking Space will be treated as available unless you inform us otherwise. It is your responsibility to ensure that you inform us of any dates your Parking Space will not be available for booking. If the availability changes at any time you must notify us as soon as practicable. Based on the availability information you have provided to us we will tailor the Website listing for your Parking Space. If you have not informed us that your Parking Space and/or charging point is unavailable for a particular date or time then you may be liable to pay the reasonable costs of alternative arrangements for a Driver who makes a booking for such date and time (up to a maximum of £250). Where this happens we may either deduct money directly from your JustPark account or pay the reasonable costs of alternative arrangements to a Driver ourselves and recover this money from you afterwards.

3. #### Payment
    
    1. Once a Booking has been accepted in accordance with this clause 4 we will request payment from the Driver. Once we have received the necessary payment from the Driver, you will have entered into a binding agreement with the Driver to allow the Driver to occupy the Parking Space during the Booking Period (as set out in our email confirming a booking ("Confirmation Email")). We will confirm a Booking to you as soon as practicable.
4. #### Bookings
    
    1. For short and medium-term use (any Booking Period of 6 weeks or less) when we request payment from a Driver we will request the full amount due in respect of the Booking at the time of booking.
    2. For long-term use (any Booking Period of more than 6 weeks) we will require that the Driver pays for the first month of the Booking Period at the time of booking. We will collect each subsequent month's payment in advance on the same day of the month for each subsequent month (or the remaining amount due for the Booking Period where less than a month is left) until the Booking Period is complete.
    3. You authorize us to accept and hold such payments on your behalf. We will forward the initial payment received from the Driver to you, within 48 hours after the start of the Booking Period or within 48 hours after the period covered by a subsequent payment in the case of a long-term booking.

2. Unless you have agreed to the Driver being given a later departure time or further Booking Period (which must be agreed through the JustPark Services), if a Driver stays longer than the Booking Period, the Driver will be liable to pay the full price for any additional time stayed. If a Driver does stay for such an additional period you authorise JustPark to collect payment of any such additional fees from Driver on your behalf.
3. You represent and confirm that you own the Parking Space or are authorised to allow third parties to use the Parking Space (including having the necessary permission from any relevant landlords, tenant, condominium association and / or other third parties to offer the Parking Space for use by Drivers) and that the licence for the Driver to use the Parking Space during the Booking Period will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations that may apply to the Parking Space, including but not limited to parking laws, tax requirements and laws governing rental of or licenses to use residential and other properties. If you are in any doubt you should check the terms of your lease ( or sublease), freehold title, mortgage, deed of trust, condominium documents or any other documents to ensure that you are able to grant a licence to use the Parking Space.
4. In relation to electric vehicle charging, you represent and confirm that you own or have authorisation to allow third parties use the charging Point.
5. You agree to notify us immediately (and provide copies where requested) upon receiving any notice, or correspondence from any governmental authority, landlord or condominium association (or other persons who control any condominium of which the Parking Space is a part) in connection with your use of the Parking Space for the Services.

6. We will not be liable to you, the Driver or any other third party if you do not have the necessary authority referred to in clause 5 iii.

### Complaints and Disputes

1. You agree that if you have any dispute with a Driver concerning your Parking Space, associated electric vehicle charging equipment or any use of the Parking Space you will attempt to resolve it in the first instance by directly communicating with the Driver.
2. In the event that a dispute cannot be resolved with the Driver directly, you may refer the dispute to us or make a complaint. Similarly, a Driver may refer a dispute to us.

Or we may require that you refund payments you have received from the relevant Booking.
3. You agree that if we determine that you should make a refund or other payment to a Driver, you will be responsible for these amounts and we may use any funds we are holding on your behalf in order to settle a dispute, deduct such funds from the debit or credit card you have supplied to us or JustPark may settle the amount owed to the Driver directly with the Driver and then seek the funds from you.
4. You agree that the provisions in this clause will survive any termination of this Agreement.

To cancel a Booking you must log into your Account and process the cancellation through the Website in accordance with the Cancellation Policy. Cancellation of a Booking will take effect at the point you receive an acknowledgement of such cancellation from us.
2. Furthermore, you agree that if a Driver wishes to cancel a booking they may do so through us and our Website and we will act as your agent in dealing with any cancellation. If we are required to process a cancellation we will do so in accordance with the Cancellation Policy.
3. If we have received any payments in respect of a booking before a Booking Period begins and such booking is subsequently cancelled by you or the Driver, you authorise us to refund the Driver from any payments we are holding on your behalf.
