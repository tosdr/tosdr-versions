    1. JustPark Parking Limited (trading as JustPark) ("us", "we" or "JustPark") provides a website and associated services ("Services") connecting those seeking to book parking spaces, charging points or storage spaces for vehicles and bicycles ("Drivers") with our JustPark registered owners who own or operate such parking spaces, charging points or storage spaces ("you" or the "Owners").
    2. These terms and conditions will apply at any time when you use this website ("Website") or any other method of accessing the Services (including via the JustPark application). By continuing to use the Website or the Services you accept these terms and conditions and they will apply to the agreement between you and us (the "Agreement").
    3. This Agreement governs the relationship between us and you. When you use the Services we are providing you with the means to enter into individual, direct contracts with Drivers to park in your parking space or use your charging point or storage spaces (“Parking Spaces”). When accepting bookings for Parking Spaces using the Services (“Bookings”) and allowing Drivers to use your Parking Space(s) you are entering into individual, direct contracts with the Drivers. You will be bound by your obligations under this Agreement and any additional obligations included in a listing relating to a Parking Space. We are not a party to the agreement between you and the Driver and we will not be liable to you, the Driver or any third party for any breach of obligations in relation to the Parking Space whether set out in this Agreement, in any listings relating to a Parking Space, Charging Session or otherwise. We simply facilitate the payment between you and the Driver for the use of the Parking Space and/or charging point provided by you.
    4. These terms and conditions may be amended from time to time as we continually develop the services we provide.

If the availability changes at any time you must notify us as soon as practicable. Based on the availability information you have provided to us we will tailor the Website listing for your Parking Space. If you have not informed us that your Parking Space and/or charging point is unavailable for a particular date or time then you may be liable to pay the reasonable costs of alternative arrangements for a Driver who makes a booking for such date and time (up to a maximum of £250). Where this happens we may either deduct money directly from your JustPark account or pay the reasonable costs of alternative arrangements to a Driver ourselves and recover this money from you afterwards.
    2. Where instant booking is used, you agree that we will manage the entire booking process and you authorise us to accept a booking for an available date without further reference to you. We will take payment from the Driver on your behalf at the time of Booking as set out below.

We will confirm a Booking to you as soon as practicable.
    4. ### Bookings

        2. For long-term use (any Booking Period of more than 6 weeks) we will require that the Driver pays for the first month of the Booking Period at the time of booking.

Or we may require that you refund payments you have received from the relevant Booking.

You agree that if we determine that you should make a refund or other payment to a Driver, you will be responsible for these amounts and we may use any funds we are holding on your behalf in order to settle a dispute, deduct such funds from the debit or credit card you have supplied to us or JustPark may settle the amount owed to the Driver directly with the Driver and then seek the funds from you.

    2. You acknowledge that we may transfer our rights under the terms (and any related claims) to any third party without having to obtain your prior permission provided that this will not affect the standard of services you receive under this Agreement and that we notify you of the date on which we will transfer our rights and obligations under this Agreement to another legal entity, Your only rights under or in connection with this Agreement will be against the new legal entity and not against us.
