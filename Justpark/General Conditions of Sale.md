Cancellation Policies
=====================

We have different cancellation policies depending on whether you booked parking in advance or if you paid in the car park. If you have driven to a car park and paid on the spot, please see the Non-Reservable Parking policy below. All bookings made in advance are covered by the Reservable Parking policy below.

Refund to your original payment method\*

* Cancelled more than 21 days before booking starts
