        1. We only transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data;
        2. When using service providers located outside the EEA, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission. These contracts are designed to ensure that personal data receives the same level of protection as it does within the European Union.
        3. When using service providers located within the USA, we may transfer personal data to them if they are part of the EU-USA Data Privacy Framework. This framework requires them to provide personal data with a level of protection similar to what it receives within the European Union.
12. Marketing communications
    ------------------------
    
    1. If you are a Member of our Website, you may occasionally receive notifications about any similar services we offer.
    2. You may also occasionally receive marketing communications from selected third parties about their services, if you have given your prior consent.
    3. In both cases mentioned above, you retain the right to unsubscribe from such marketing communications at any time by clicking the link provided at the bottom of each communication. Please note that unsubscribing will not affect the delivery of essential system notifications or important account-related communications.
13. How long we keep your personal data for
    ---------------------------------------
    
    1. We will keep your personal data in accordance with our retention policy for the duration required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected for. This includes meeting any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations. In cases of complaints or if we have a reasonable belief that litigation might arise, we may retain your personal data for an extended period.
    2. To calculate the suitable duration for keeping your personal data, we take several factors into consideration. These factors include the volume, type, and sensitivity level of the personal data, the potential risks associated with the unauthorized access or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for processing your personal data, the feasibility of achieving these objectives through alternative means, and any relevant laws and regulations.
    3. When there is no longer a necessity to process your personal data for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, we will proceed to delete your personal data from our systems. Nevertheless, in cases where we are unable to delete it due to legal, regulatory, or technical constraints, we will ensure that your privacy remains safeguarded, and your data will be utilized solely for those specific purposes.

        7. The right to object: You have the right to object to our use of your personal data for our own purpose at any time.

This right also includes the right to object to processing your personal information for marketing and advertising purposes.
        8. The right not to be subject to automated decision making and profiling: You have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, when it has legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.

        10. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.
    2. Important considerations:
        1. If you choose not to provide your email address during registration (or after creating your account by editing your profile), and you subsequently forget your username or password, we will be unable to verify that the account belongs to you. As a result, you will not be able to regain access to your account, request its deletion, or exercise any other rights described herein.
        2. Deletion requests will not affect any personal data that we are legally required to retain, whether due to laws or regulations, or if we have received a preservation request from a competent authority.
        3. If you request the deletion of all your personal data, it will result in both the loss of access to the majority of our services and to the permanent closure of your account on our Website.
        4. Within our services and by using your account, we offer the possibility to conveniently create accounts on various platforms with whom we have contractual relationships, as described in clause 8 of this Privacy Policy. If you have created one or more accounts on third party platforms using the technology described above and wish to delete your account from our Website, you will also lose access to the services provided by those third parties (if applicable). In other words, if we delete your personal data and account on our Website, you will also lose access to services provided by such third party(ies) and any subscriptions or purchases made on such third party(ies) platforms (if applicable).
        5. To fulfill your request, we may need to request additional information from you to verify your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that we are acting upon the request of the correct natural person and in order to protect the privacy and security of your personal data.
    3. We will address your request regarding your rights within a maximum period of thirty (30) days, taking into account the specific circumstances and complexity of the request. Please note that this period may be extended by two (2) further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.
    4. If you wish to exercise any of your rights or if you have any questions regarding the use of your personal data, please contact us through our [Contact us/Single point of contact](https://xhamster.com/info/contact) and select the 'Privacy/GDPR Requests' option.
