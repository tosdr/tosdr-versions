9. Members' and Verified Members’ profile information
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    1. Members and Verified Members should be aware that certain information directly provided on the Website when they create an account is public, unless stated otherwise. This may include, but is not limited to, usernames, profile pictures, and personal details. Even if a Member's or Verified Member’s profile does not contain any personal information, it could still enable identification through other information available in the Member's or Verified Member’s profile.
    2. Members and Verified Members have full control over the information they post, upload, or showcase on the Website.

Nevertheless, it's important to note that while we implement various security measures, we cannot entirely eliminate the security risks associated with storage and transmission of personal data. For example, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will be immune to third-party hackers seeking to illegitimately obtain this information.

        2. When using service providers located outside the EEA, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission. These contracts are designed to ensure that personal data receives the same level of protection as it does within the European Union.
        3. When using service providers located within the USA, we may transfer personal data to them if they are part of the EU-USA Data Privacy Framework. This framework requires them to provide personal data with a level of protection similar to what it receives within the European Union.

    1. We will keep your personal data in accordance with our retention policy for the duration required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected for. This includes meeting any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations. In cases of complaints or if we have a reasonable belief that litigation might arise, we may retain your personal data for an extended period.
    2. To calculate the suitable duration for keeping your personal data, we take several factors into consideration. These factors include the volume, type, and sensitivity level of the personal data, the potential risks associated with the unauthorized access or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for processing your personal data, the feasibility of achieving these objectives through alternative means, and any relevant laws and regulations.
    3. When there is no longer a necessity to process your personal data for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, we will proceed to delete your personal data from our systems. Nevertheless, in cases where we are unable to delete it due to legal, regulatory, or technical constraints, we will ensure that your privacy remains safeguarded, and your data will be utilized solely for those specific purposes.
14. Your rights under the GDPR
    --------------------------
    
    1. Under the GDPR, data subjects have specific rights regarding the processing of their personal data. It is important to note that these rights are subject to certain limitations and conditions. Here is the list of the key rights granted to data subjects under the GDPR:

        2. The right of access: You have the right to see the personal data we hold about you and to receive a copy of this information.
        3. The right to rectification: You can request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data about you.
        4. The right to erasure: You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data without undue delay. You can request this under certain circumstances, such as when:
            1. We no longer need to process your personal data for the purposes it was provided for;
            2. You wish to withdraw your consent;
            3. You believe your personal data have been unlawfully processed;
            4. You object to the processing, and there is no overriding legitimate ground for such processing; or
            5. The personal data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject to.
        5. The right to restriction of processing: You can request the restriction of processing of your personal data, if you believe that:
            1. Your personal data is inaccurate;
            2. The processing is unlawful but you do not want us to delete your personal data;
            3. We no longer need your personal data for the purpose it was collected for but you want us to keep it for use in legal claims;
            4. You have already objected to the processing of your personal data but you are waiting for us to confirm if we have overriding legitimate grounds to use your personal data.
        6. The right to data portability: You have the right to receive your personal data in a format that allows you to transmit it to another controller. You can also request us to provide it directly to a third party, if technically feasible. Please be aware that we are not responsible for any third party’s use of your account information, which will be governed by their agreement with you and any privacy statement they provide to you.
        7. The right to object: You have the right to object to our use of your personal data for our own purpose at any time. If you exercise this right, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise, and defense of legal claims. This right also includes the right to object to processing your personal information for marketing and advertising purposes.
        8. The right not to be subject to automated decision making and profiling: You have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, when it has legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.
        9. The right to withdraw your consent: If your data is processed based on your consent, you can revoke it at any time. Please be aware that in certain cases withdrawing your consent may lead to restriction of functionalities of our Website and services.
        10. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.
    2. Important considerations:
        1. If you choose not to provide your email address during registration (or after creating your account by editing your profile), and you subsequently forget your username or password, we will be unable to verify that the account belongs to you. As a result, you will not be able to regain access to your account, request its deletion, or exercise any other rights described herein.
        2. Deletion requests will not affect any personal data that we are legally required to retain, whether due to laws or regulations, or if we have received a preservation request from a competent authority.
        3. If you request the deletion of all your personal data, it will result in both the loss of access to the majority of our services and to the permanent closure of your account on our Website.
        4. Within our services and by using your account, we offer the possibility to conveniently create accounts on various platforms with whom we have contractual relationships, as described in clause 8 of this Privacy Policy. If you have created one or more accounts on third party platforms using the technology described above and wish to delete your account from our Website, you will also lose access to the services provided by those third parties (if applicable). In other words, if we delete your personal data and account on our Website, you will also lose access to services provided by such third party(ies) and any subscriptions or purchases made on such third party(ies) platforms (if applicable).
        5. To fulfill your request, we may need to request additional information from you to verify your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that we are acting upon the request of the correct natural person and in order to protect the privacy and security of your personal data.
    3. We will address your request regarding your rights within a maximum period of thirty (30) days, taking into account the specific circumstances and complexity of the request. Please note that this period may be extended by two (2) further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.
    4. If you wish to exercise any of your rights or if you have any questions regarding the use of your personal data, please contact us through our [Contact us/Single point of contact](https://xhamster.com/info/contact) and select the 'Privacy/GDPR Requests' option.
