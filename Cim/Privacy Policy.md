To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal information, we consider various factors, such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of your information; the potential risk of unauthorized access, use or disclosure; the purposes for which we collect or process your personal information; and applicable legal requirements.  

‍

‍

4. **Cookies**‍

Our website functions are based, in part, on your browser's ability to accept cookie files. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive that allow you to more easily navigate a website and customize website features that are updated each time you visit a website. Our web servers may automatically recognize a visitor’s domain name (such as .com, .edu, etc.), the web page from which a visitor enters our website, which pages a visitor visits on our website and on certain other websites, and/or how much time a visitor spends on each page. We may also use cookies to track you or your online activities over time or across websites.  We aggregate this information and use it to evaluate and improve our website, or to support our advertising practices.  
  
You may set your preferences to refuse cookies; however, this may limit your access to some areas of our website. If you have enabled your Internet browser to refuse cookies, we will not collect personal information about you. However, we do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.

‍

‍

5. **Collecting the Personal Information of Minors**‍

Our products and services are not directed to minors under the age of 16 and we do not knowingly collect or sell the personal information of minors.

‍

‍

6. **Your Choices Regarding Direct Marketing**‍

On occasion, we may use your personal information for direct marketing purposes and/or provide your personal information to affiliates for direct marketing purposes.  If you do not wish to receive such marketing communications from us, please let us know that you would like to “opt out” by emailing us at [privacy@cimgroup.com](mailto:%20privacy@cimgroup.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Inquiry), contacting us at 1-833-687-3621 [or using this webform](#Privacy-Form-Link-Target).  
  
Some email communications from us include instructions on how to stop receiving them. Please follow these instructions if you no longer wish to receive such email messages from us.

‍

‍

7. **Online Advertising**‍

We endeavor, in good faith, to adhere to self-regulatory advertising principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Principles. If you are interested in learning more about and/or opting out of online behavioral advertising, sometimes called interest-based advertising, we encourage you to visit one of the advertising industry-developed opt-out pages, such as [www.youradchoices.com](https://www.youradchoices.com/) or [aboutads.info](https://www.aboutads.info/). Please note that while we provide these links for your convenience, we do not have access to, or control over, these sites’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.  

‍

‍

8. **Protecting Your Personal Information**‍

We implement and maintain reasonable data security safeguards appropriate to the nature of the personal information that we collect, use, retain, transfer or otherwise process. Our policy is to restrict access to your personal information to only those employees, service providers and other third parties who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain commercially reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards consistent with industry standards and other applicable standards as required by law and we require service providers and third parties to do the same.  
  
While we are committed to developing, implementing, maintaining, monitoring and updating a reasonable information security program, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Data security incidents and breaches can occur due to vulnerabilities, criminal exploits or other factors that cannot reasonably be prevented.  Accordingly, while our reasonable security program is designed to manage data security risks and thus help prevent data security incidents and breaches, it cannot be assumed that the occurrence of any given incident or breach results from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the website cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.  

‍

‍

9. **Links to Third-Party Websites**‍

Our websites may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. Privacy policies on such linked websites may be different from our Privacy Policy. You access such linked websites at your own risk. You should always read the Privacy Policy of a linked website before disclosing any personal information on such website.  

‍

‍

10. **Policy Changes**‍

To improve the services we can offer you, and in connection with changes in our business operations, CIM may opt to expand or modify our capabilities for obtaining and processing information, including personal information, about users in the future. CIM will update this Privacy Policy when necessary to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.  
  
We will post those changes on our websites and update our Privacy Policy so that you will know what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have. Please be sure to check this page before proceeding to use our websites or provide us personal information. Regardless of any changes we make to our Privacy Policy, we will always use your personal information in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy in place at the time you provided your information, unless you give your express consent for us to do otherwise or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.  

‍

‍

11. **Additional Privacy Terms**‍

In conducting business with CIM, in connection with your application for or employment with us, or when using our websites, you may be required to agree to additional written or electronic agreements, including additional privacy terms and conditions (“**Additional Privacy Terms**”), as a condition to visiting the websites or receiving products, services, employment and/or other information. In the event of any conflict between the Additional Privacy Terms and this Privacy Policy, the Additional Privacy Terms shall prevail but we will treat personal information that you provide to us before we adopt such Additional Privacy Terms in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, unless and until you agree with the application of the Additional Privacy Terms to your personal information collected by us prior to the updates or amendments or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.  

‍

‍

12. **Your Feedback**‍

To help us improve our Privacy Policy and practices, please give us your feedback by emailing us at [privacy@cimgroup.com](mailto:%20privacy@cimgroup.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Inquiry), contacting us at 1-833-687-3621 [or using this webform](#Privacy-Form-Link-Target).
