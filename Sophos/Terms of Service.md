**4\. CUSTOMER CONTENT; PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER CONTENT; CONFIDENTIALITY; USE OF DATA**

**4.1 Customer Content**. Customer is solely responsible for all Customer Content, including but not limited to its accuracy, quality, and legality. Customer represents and warrants that it: (a) has the legal rights to provide Customer Content to Sophos or/and to other users of the Product as applicable; (b) has provided any required notices and has obtained any consents and/or authorizations (including any required from Users) related to its access and use of the Product and the processing of and access to Customer Content by Sophos; and (c) will comply with all applicable laws and regulations for collecting and processing Customer Content, and transferring Customer Content to Sophos.

In the event of any conflict between the terms of the DPA and this Agreement, the terms of the DPA will take precedence.

**4.4 Content Restrictions**. If Customer’s access and use of the Product requires Customer to comply with industry-specific data security or data protection obligations, Customer will be solely responsible for such compliance. Customer may not use the Product in a way that would subject Sophos to those industry-specific regulations without obtaining Sophos’ prior written agreement.

**4.5 Confidentiality**.

(a) Each party acknowledges that it and its Affiliates (**“Receiving** **Party”**) may have access to Confidential Information of the other party and its Affiliates (**“Disclosing** **Party”**) in connection with this Agreement. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care). The Receiving Party agrees to (i) not use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement, and (ii) restrict dissemination of Confidential Information only to individuals or third parties with a “need to know” such information and who are under a substantially similar duty of confidentiality. A Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in any legal proceeding or as required as a matter of applicable law or regulation (such as in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, governmental request, or other legal process); provided, however, that to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Receiving Party will (1) promptly notify the Disclosing Party before disclosing the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; (2) reasonably cooperate with and assist the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party’s expense, in any efforts by the Disclosing Party to contest the disclosure; and (3) disclose only that portion of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed.

Otherwise, Customer will pay Sophos, or the local Sophos sales Affiliate, the fees for the Product within thirty (30) days of the invoice date (in the currency and via the payment method specified on the invoice), unless otherwise noted in the applicable invoice. If permitted by applicable law, any delay in making payment shall entitle Sophos to charge interest on the overdue payment.

The foregoing shall be Sophos’s entire obligation and Customer’s exclusive remedy regarding any third-party claim against Customer.

**11.4 Force Majeure**. Except for payment obligations, neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform hereunder due to circumstances beyond such party’s reasonable control.

**11.5** **Community Forum.** Customer and other Sophos customers may exchange ideas and technical insight related to Sophos offerings in the [](https://community.sophos.com/)Sophos Community site at [https://community.sophos.com/](https://community.sophos.com/). Sophos does not endorse, warrant, or guarantee any information posted on that site, and Customer alone assumes the risk of using any such information.

**11.6** **Third Party Flow-down**. If the Product is Sophos Central Wireless, the [Google Maps / Google Earth Additional Terms of Service](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html) (including the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)) apply to use of the Product.

**11.7** **Service Monitoring**. Customer acknowledges that Sophos continuously monitors the Service to: (a) track usage and Entitlement, (b) provide support, (c) monitor the performance, integrity, and stability of the Service’s infrastructure, (d) prevent or remediate technical issues, and (e) detect and address illegal acts or violations of Section 2.3 (**Restrictions**).

**11.8 Audit Rights.**  To the extent tracking of Customer’s Use Level (**Section** **2.2**) is not possible, Sophos may audit Customer’s use of the Product to verify that Customer’s usage complies with the applicable Entitlement, including without limitation through self-certifications, on-site audits and/or audits done using a third party auditor. An audit will be done upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, but not more often than once each year unless a material discrepancy was identified during the course of a prior review. Customer further agrees to keep accurate records sufficient to certify Customer’s compliance with this Agreement, and, upon Sophos’s request, Customer will promptly provide the necessary details certifying Customer’s aggregate usage of the Product. Sophos will bear the costs of any such audit (other than Customer’s costs associated with any self-certification), except where the audit demonstrates that the amount of the underpayment exceeds five percent (5%) of the fees due. In such case, in addition to purchasing appropriate Entitlement and paying for past excess usage, Customer will reimburse Sophos all reasonable and demonstrable costs of the audit.
