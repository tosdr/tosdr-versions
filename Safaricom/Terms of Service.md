3. Afritrip is a member of ATTA (member #206430)
4. You can learn more about the Afritrip shareholders [here](https://www.safari.com/travel-with-us#financial-protection).
5. Safari.com is an authorised reseller of all products listed on this website. In particular it is an authorised reseller of products in which it has a binding tour operator agreement.
6. Currency and merchant outlet country - transaction Currency is ZAR (South African Rand). The merchant outlet country at the time of presenting payment options to the cardholder is South Africa.
7. Users may contact Safari.com by sending an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.safari.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or by using the ‘Contact Us’ button on the website. Users may also make contact by calling **+27 21 468 7255** or sending a fax to **+27 21 468 7250**.

9. Safari.com may, in its sole discretion, change this agreement or any part thereof at any time without notice.
10. Safari.com chooses as its domicilium citandi et executandi for all purposes under this agreement, whether in respect of court process, notice, or other documents or communication of whatsoever nature: Watershed, 17 Dock Road, Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, Cape Town  
    
11. Safari.com operates as a guide to enable users to find, book and pay for, accommodation and packaged tours. Safari.com thus acts as an advertising medium for these services and facilitates payments through the use of a payment gateway. However, the contract is based on an offer by the establishment which is accepted by the guest and therefore exists legally between these two parties. Safari.com's responsibility with regard to any transaction is to assist both parties to agree on a booking, to receive payment from the guest for the required amount, to pass such payment to the establishment/operator after deducting agreed commission and to provide the guest with a reservation reference number, if applicable. The commission is only earned and brought to account once the client's arrangements have been completed.
12. Safari.com is also responsible for providing support to users of the website by means of the 'Contact Us' button. In the event of a dispute between the guest and the establishment/operator, Safari.com will assist in resolving such dispute. Safari.com does not, however, underwrite or guarantee bookings between the guest and establishment/operator or the accuracy of the information portrayed by the establishment/operator or in its quote. In the event of any dispute between guest and establishment/operator, Safari.com will assist with the resolving of such disputes but is not liable to either party for any claims, damages or refunds of any type.

‍

DISCLAIMER

1. All information and systems are the property of Afritrip Group. Apart from the provisions of sections 43(5) and 43(6) of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, neither Safari.com nor any of its agents or representatives shall be liable for any damage, loss or liability of whatsoever nature arising from the use or inability to use this website or the services or content provided from and through this website. Furthermore, Safari.com makes no representations or warranties, implied or otherwise, that, amongst others, the content and technology available from this website are free from errors or omissions or that the service will be uninterrupted and error free. Users are encouraged to report any possible malfunctions and errors to [\[email protected\]](https://www.safari.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
2. Information, ideas and opinions expressed on this site should not be regarded as professional advice or the official opinion of Safari.com and users are encouraged to consult professional advice before taking any course of action related to information, ideas or opinions expressed on this site.
3. The establishment owner and/or operator agrees that guest comments can be published on the establishment listing by guests who have stayed at the establishment and further agrees that Safari.com is not liable or responsible in any way for the verification or accuracy of any guest comments made.
4. In terms of these standard trading conditions, and any contract/s concluded pursuant hereto, Safari.com acts as agent only for and on behalf of the client in procuring the services. As such, Safari.com shall procure the services for and behalf of the client as agent for it with relevant third party service providers concerned. Safari.com shall, under no circumstances, be liable for the acts and omissions of the relevant third party suppliers concerned.
5. Neither Safari.com nor any of its agents or representatives shall be liable for any damage, loss or liability of whatsoever nature arising from the use or inability to use any services sold by Safari.com.

‍

PAYMENT METHODS

1. **Credit card payments**  
    Safari.com has all your transactions protected by powerful Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer and other popular browsers. SSL encrypts all your personal information before it travels over the Internet. This makes doing online business just as secure as telephonic business. SSL safe connection and secure transaction technology has effectively protected thousands of our customers who have transmitted their credit card numbers online and made a purchase since we launched.
2. Payment is only collected when a quotation has been received from the establishment, while the quotation has not yet expired and when the guest accepts the quotation. Once payment has been made against a quotation, the offer and its acceptance become a binding contract. Following acceptance the establishment is required to send confirmation of the booking.
3. Safari.com was the first company in South Africa to implement 3-D Secure (3DS) credit card security. 3DS is an added layer of security for online credit card transactions. By requesting a pin number with the credit card details, fraud is greatly reduced. It operates in the same way as taking money out of an ATM machine, requiring both the card and a PIN.  
      
    Most new credit cards are 3DS-enabled, and old cards can still be activated with 3DS through the cardholder's bank. The advantage for buyers is when his/her card is activated by 3-D Secure, a login and password must be provided. Merchants such as Safari.com do not have access to this security information, only the bank and their Access Control Server (ACS) have access to this information.
4. Customer details are separated from card details : No credit card details are stored at Safari.com
5. **Direct deposits / EFT's**  
      
    Banking details (for wire transfers)  
    Account holder: **Afritrip Group**  
    Bank: **Standard Bank**  
    Branch: **Claremont**  
    Branch code: **025109**  
    SWIFT code: **SBZAZAJJ**  
    Account number: **271-684-372**  
      
    The SWIFT code needs to be used for international payments.
6. Such payments are required to be made at least 7 days before the expiry of a quotation, in order to allow sufficient time for the payment to clear into the Safari.com bank account. The quotation (offer) is deemed accepted when the guest payment is received into the Safari.com bank account within the validity period.
7. Clients must pay the exact amount and must place a reference number on the deposit slip..

‍

DEPOSITS

1. Payment is made either of the minimum 50% deposit required or the full amount. In certain circumstances the minimum deposit is equal to the full amount of the quotation.
2. As soon as payment has cleared into the Safari.com / Afritrip Group bank account, delivery has taken place on the part of the guest and the establishment is required to confirm the reservation and a reservation confirmation reference number is issued. Delivery on the part of the establishment takes place when the guest has physically taken up the accommodation reserved.
3. Establishments may apply cancellation policies and these are clearly displayed on every quotation. Cancellation policies will have implications for refunds and these are dealt with in **clause 5**.
4. Value added tax at 14% is charged by VAT registered establishments on bookings by South African residents.

‍

CANCELLATION TERMS

1. **Our Cancellation Policy is as follows:**
    * Flights are non-refundable.
    * Cancellation prior to 61+ days of travel – 25% deposit is forfeited.
    * Cancellation prior to 60 - 31 days of travel – 50% of total cost is forfeited.
    * Cancellation less than 30 days prior to travel – 100% of total cost is forfeited.
2. Please note that at certain times of the year and for certain of our suppliers, cancellation policies may be more stringent than our above policy and therefore the company holds the right to forward such additional charges onto the client should such an instance occur.
3. Safari.com will make every effort to avoid misquotation, however if we have made an obvious error or omission which leads to a material cost implication we reserve the right to cancel a reservation without liability or penalty, or to allow you to make a top up payment to accommodate for such error or omission.
4. Safari.com reserves the right to levy a 5% admin charge on credit card and bank transfer refunds due to cancellations.

‍

GOVERNING LAW / LEGAL JURISDICTION

1. This site is managed, controlled and operated from the Republic of South Africa and is therefore governed by South African law.

> Anja at Safari.com was a great partner to work with!

> Working with Anja at Safari.com was great. She was able to work some magic and got us a few nights at the safari lodge we really wanted, Ngoma. Unfortunately, our flight from the USA to South Africa was canceled and we were rebooked a day later but Anja was great about making sure our lodge and the transports knew about the change in plans and made sure we got to our trip as soon as we could. She was a great partner to have and communicated quickly whenever we reached out. I would highly recommend using her when planning a trip to Africa!
