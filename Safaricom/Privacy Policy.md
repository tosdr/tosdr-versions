> Exceptional travel agent and overall experience!!

> Leigh Ann was an exceptional travel agent who went above and beyond to make our trip to Kruger National Park, Victoria Falls, and Chobe unforgettable. Her recommendations were spot-on, and what made the experience even better was her personal perspective—insights you simply won’t find online. She shared tips that added so much value to our trip and made everything feel more meaningful. Leigh Ann was available anytime we had questions, which made us feel completely supported throughout the trip. From the initial planning stages to our return, every detail was seamless and perfectly coordinated. If you’re planning a trip to Africa, I highly recommend Leigh Ann. She truly gave us a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Thank you, Leigh Ann!

> Luxury South Africa Tour

> I inquired into a South African safari tour. I asked two questions, is this a private tour and what are the available dates in May. The first question wasn't answered and the itinerary presented was for "May 2025" but had February dates. When I asked for clarification on the timeline and the dates, there was no response (over 3 days now). I would expect a better response for a luxury tour.

> 3-nights Zambia trip

> I would start by saying before I started talking to Leigh-Ann Croeser I knew I wanted to go on this 3-nights adventure in Zambia with my family towards the end of this year, but I did not have any idea of how to go about planning it, thankfully Leigh-Ann responded immediately to my enquiry. Ever since I started communicating with her, she has been a very friendly, professional, knowledgeable, awesome Luxury Safari consultant who came through for me in every step of this process. She offered great advice and did a great job in customizing our itinerary and put my mind at ease in the process. She always responded quickly and gave me great advise when I needed. We are so looking forward to going on this adventure. I want to thank her from the bottom of my heart;) Thembi Coleman and her family

> The lodge was great, very friendly stuff. Saw all kind of animals. The vendor we booked the lodge, charged way to much, compared when you book the lodge directly.
