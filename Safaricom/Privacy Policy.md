> It was a great experience dealing with Shann. She was most accommodating and patient. We managed to sort things out very eventually. The only sore point I have is the 2 % surcharge for the card handling fee, which I find too excessive. Otherwise, I am pleased with everything.

> Keith went above and beyond expectations arranging our holiday safari travels (for one vegan and one mobility-impaired traveller, no less:-). Safari.com is lucky to have Keith on board. He helped us feel confident in our choices, keeping us up to date with options, and finessing holiday scheduling issues with aplomb.

> Trip to Kruger at Mdluli Safari Lodge

> I loved working with Anja from safari.com. She put together my itinerary within my price range and was very professional, thorough and empathetic. She followed up with me many times to see if I needed anything throughout my trip and even filled out some forms for me when I was having difficulty. When the lodge I stayed at was not being accommodating in the slightest, she quickly contacted the manager and got them to rearrange their services to meet my needs. I would most certainly use safari.com again due to my wonderful experience working with Anja.

> Nicole at Safari.com is AMAZING!!!

> I would love to share my experience with Nicole. She has worked tirelessly to help me make my dream vacation a reality. I had no idea how to start planning. Nicole suggested the most wonderful South African resorts and safaris. No matter how many changes I threw her way it was always received with a happy, positive attitude. I live in Hawaii and even though we were on a 12 hour time difference she was always available to answer any questions or concerns. Her expertise, knowledge and patience are unmeasurable. I was plagued with numerous payment issues from my bank in Hawaii. Nicole never wavered from being patience and more importantly positive that we could resolve each issue and get my trip booked. Nicole is a huge asset to Safari.com and I will scream it from the mountains to let everyone know what excellent customer service I have received. Nicole is a ROCKSTAR!!! We are so excited for our upcoming adventure of a lifetime!
