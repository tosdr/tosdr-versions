> Mel at Safari.com was very helpful.

> Mel at Safari.com was very helpful. He is a professional and highly courteous. We changed our itinerary four times and he very patiently replied with new quotes and even suggested that we should not take some parts because it is too expensive. He never tried to sell us the most expensive itinerary - just what is right for us. I would highly recommend Mel at Safari.com if you want to go on a safari .

> The price was right

> The price was right, but when I asked for additional info, like does the provided insurance comply with South African requirements, I got a blank response. So not five stars.

> Anja is amazing

> Anja is amazing! She made planning our 2 week trip a breeze including rental car, safari, flights, and booking our adventures. She is a wealth of knowledge and I believe we will get more out of our trip using her. I'd highly recommend using Safari.com, not just for your safari, but also to organize and maximize your entire vacation. Pleased to know her to say the least. I will follow up this review for BOOKING with an after the trip review also.
