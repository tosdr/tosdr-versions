> Keith Chideme is fantastic!

> If you’re looking for someone to help you plan the trip of a lifetime, look no further than Keith Chideme. Keith has been nothing short of extraordinary in helping me create a month-long dream trip to South Africa for myself and 11 family members. His patience, kindness, and thoughtfulness throughout the entire process have been remarkable. Keith went above and beyond, engaging in countless conversations to make sure every detail of our six-destination itinerary was just right. He worked tirelessly to balance my budget with my desire for an unforgettable experience, finding deals and creative solutions that I would never have managed on my own. His dedication and expertise gave me complete confidence that this trip will be everything I’ve dreamed of and more. One of my favorite aspects of working with Keith was the personal touch he brought to every interaction. Whether through voice messages, phone calls, or texts, he was always patient, thorough, and thoughtful in explaining every aspect of the itinerary. I never once felt rushed or overlooked—he truly cared about making this trip perfect for us. I can’t imagine planning this trip without Keith. Knowing he has my back has been such a comfort, and I feel completely at ease knowing we are in such capable hands. My entire family is incredibly excited about this incredible adventure, and I know I’ll be contacting Keith for all my future travel plans. He is an absolute gem and a true professional. Thank you, Keith, for everything!

> I tried setting everything up myself

> I tried setting everything up myself, but ran into a few hiccups. Less than an hour after reaching out to them in the late afternoon from overseas, I had a response. Leigh-Ann Croeser was quick to help me with all my lodging/ transport/ and special dietary plan needs. I'm looking forward to taking my special someone to this amazing place!

> Lindi Weeks - Safari.com. A Pleasure to Work With.

> I recently had the pleasure of working with Lindi Weeks of Safari.com to plan our dream safari, and I couldn't be happier with the experience! From start to finish, she was incredibly patient, answering every question I had and addressing all my concerns. Her knowledge of safari destinations, wildlife, and logistics is truly impressive – it’s clear she’s a seasoned expert in the field! Beyond being well-informed, Lindi is an all-around wonderful person to work with. She was understanding of our budget and needs, and she crafted an itinerary that perfectly balanced adventure, relaxation, and unique wildlife encounters. At every step, I felt like I was in great hands, knowing Lindi had thought of every detail to make our trip as memorable as possible. If you're considering a safari adventure and want someone who is knowledgeable, patient, and truly cares about making your experience unforgettable, I highly recommend Lindi

> This is the second time this year we have used Shann Shaw at Safari.com. She is outstanding in her role and is always so flexible and helpful. She literally goes beyond expectations and nothing is ever to much for her and there is never any frustrations when plans have to be re-started if flights arriving later than expected. She also comes up with wonderful ideas for trips and not just limited to Safari's but for hotels in South Africa as well. i don't normally write reviews but Shann deserves every accolade that comes her way. thank you so much - Bryan & Jo
