> An Adventure Of A Lifetime

> In planning our South Africa vacation last year, I went online looking for a safari adventure. There were many companies but eventually returned to Safari.Com’s website which offered many itineraries. Luckily, their agent, Dolan quickly contacted me and planned the perfect trip to Sabi Sabi Bush Lodge. I liked his quick responses to my many, many questions. Dolan handled all reservations not only the lodge but hotels, airlines and private transportation. It was an amazing vacation. Our daughter and her family decided on a vacation to South Africa so we are all headed back again this year and Safari.Com and Dolan have again done the planning even our trip insurance. I highly recommend Dolan and Safari.Com for an amazing adventure!

> A wonderful experience

> We visit South Africa with an international team at least once a year and organizing a memorable time for our team is time-consuming and challenging at times. Leigh-Ann is efficient, prompt and focussed on details. She booked our team trip in no time and made sure everything was satifactory. We will not hesitate to contact her for our future safari needs.
