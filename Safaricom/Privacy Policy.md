> First time to Cape Town

> We are a group of ten friends traveling together to Cape Town for the first time. Safari.com was our top choice for travel agents. Leché and Tracy were incredibly helpful and prompt with our questions and bookings. The trip to Sanbona Wildlife Reserve was fantastic, and everything went off without a hitch. We highly recommend Safari.com for your safari plans!

> South Africa Here We Come!!!

> We had the inclination to take Rovos Rail through part of South Africa and found Safari.com online. Nicole Van der Merwe, the friendly agent who connected with us was amazing! We connected on WhatsApp and were handled with absolute care. Nicole answered our questions in detail and within one day, were were booked on the train in the Royal Suite! We look forward to completing the additional details of our fabulous train/safari trip with her! As we have never been to SA, Nicole and Safari.com took away ALL of the concerns we had about making our trip a reality. to tell you the truth, it has been a long time since we have been treated this way by such a wonderful travel firm. Safari.com makes makes traveling to SA simple! We look forward to having them assist us with the additional details.

> Jayson is polite and knowledgeable…Highly recommend

> Jayson was a polite and knowledgeable person. He was never 'pushy' and gave us a lot of options. He was very understanding when we had to 'delay' our plans due to an aging mother-in-laws health and wellbeing. We have every intention of pursuing our dream of visiting Africa in the 2025/26 season and we will certainly be in-touch with Jayson. Many thanks to Jayson
