> Leigh-Ann Croeser from Safari.com was fantastic

> Leigh-Ann from Safari.com was great to work with to plan our group safari trip. She was able to get me on the priority waitlist for a lodge that I liked, which ended up working out for our group during my preferred dates. Leigh-Ann was responsive and provided various tour recommendations for us to decide on the best option for us. There were a few email and name typos from Leigh-Ann that I had to correct, but other than that, I had a great experience.

> Dolan was terrific

> Dolan was terrific. He got back to us immediately to answer all of our questions. And was so nice to hold a room for a couple of days because of my moms passing. It gave us time to finalize her arrangements and time to book our trip. I would highly recommend using him to book your trip!!
