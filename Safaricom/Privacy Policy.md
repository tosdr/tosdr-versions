YOUR INFORMATION

1. Safari.com will only use your information in connection with processing a booking enquiry.  
    When you place an enquiry, all information including names, email, address and contact numbers will be stored in our secure database. This information may be imparted to the establishment or operator rendering the required services during the course of processing the booking. While no website can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us.

‍

WE VALUE YOUR PRIVACY

1. Excepting the operator or establishment in question, Safari.com will never divulge any of your information to third parties.  
    Though payment is made through Safari.com, none of your credit card will be stored on our system or by our payment gateway. Only the last 4 digits of your credit card will be kept to identify the transaction in the case of any requests or disputes.

‍

EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS

1. We will only use your email address to communicate regarding your initial enquiry, to send through an electronic booking form for the purpose of processing the booking, or to let you know about special offers and relevant news (you may op-out of promotional emails at any time). Prior to processing the booking, we may also send you information regarding specials for the enquired product or related products prior to making payment.

‍

COOKIES

1. Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits).  
      
    This website sets up basic cookies after placing an enquiry so that, should you place subsequent enquiries, parts of your information are automatically completed for you to avoid unnecessary re-entering of this information.  
      
    This website also uses cookies from third party vendors for website analysis (Google Analytics) and conversion tracking (Google Adwords).

> Great advice, responsive and knowledgeable!

> Pascal John at Safari.com guided me on different safari lodges (experience, rating), and most importantly knew about specials (buy 3 nights, get 4th for free) which allowed my family to secure a 5-star location at a more reasonable rate. Great advice, responsive and knowledgeable!
