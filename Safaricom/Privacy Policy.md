> Anja helped us to craft our dream vacation

> The reason why we used Safari.com was because of Anja. We really had no idea of what we wanted so we were not the easiest customers by a long stretch. With Anja’s help and patience we developed about 25 itineraries until we crafted our dream vacation that is taking us across 4 countries. It is an amazing itinerary and this was all possible because of Anja’s dedication to making our seemingly crazy ideas come to fruition in a manner that was realistic and met our budgetary requirements.
