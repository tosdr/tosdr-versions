> Excellent Experience with Shann

> Our experience with Safari.com was excellent. Shann was very helpful throughout the whole experience, from providing multiple options during the booking process to helping us during the trip if we ever had any questions. Everything was organised to perfection, and I would highly recommend Shann to anyone looking to book a holiday with Safari.com.

She was always helpful, and patient and I never felt that I am only a number. Thank you, Tracey! I will definitely make use of Safari.com again!

> Anja helped us to craft our dream vacation

> The reason why we used Safari.com was because of Anja. We really had no idea of what we wanted so we were not the easiest customers by a long stretch. With Anja’s help and patience we developed about 25 itineraries until we crafted our dream vacation that is taking us across 4 countries. It is an amazing itinerary and this was all possible because of Anja’s dedication to making our seemingly crazy ideas come to fruition in a manner that was realistic and met our budgetary requirements.
