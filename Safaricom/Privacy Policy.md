> Dorothy my travel agent

> Dorothy is the agent assigned to me. She was very patient and polite . Each time I gave her feedback of what wasn't suitable or to my liking she came back with better. She really listened and made us good priced tailor made package. She was also very responsive weekends , late night and early morning. When ever I got around to responding to a message she sent she would always respond within minutes.

> Highly recommend Safari.com and Dolan!

> I can't say enough good things about Safari.com and in particular Dolan Sequera. South Africa was daunting to plan for and felt I needed some help. I did a lot of research and chose Safari.com and was matched with Dolan. I had a general idea of the trip I wanted to plan for my husband, myself, and our two children (19, 21). Dolan was incredible. He listened to what I wanted and make excellent recommendations. Then he helped book it all. Our trip was 16 days and we visited Cape Town, an Elephant sanctuary, and Safari. And everything went incredibly smooth - no hiccups. He even welcomed me when I landed in South Africa and checked in along our trip. A couple of times I needed to change transfer times and he responded immediately. I felt confident he would help us if any issues arose. It was a trip of a lifetime for my whole family and I am thankful for the help from Dolan and his team at Safari.com.

> Sara from Safari.com was the agent who handled our itinerary. She was extremely responsive and provided several choices which fit our timelines and budget. She was always available for discussions over WhatsApp whenever I had questions. I am writing this review prior to actually going on the trip, but everything up to this point has been very smooth.

> Safari had a lot of tours to choose from. I’m not a big fan of communicating via emails but they responded promptly! Candis reached out to us immediately and within 2 hours or so we knew which tour company we wanted to use.
