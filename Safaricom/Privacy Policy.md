> Great service from Denise at Safari.com

> Denise from Safari.com was extremely helpful. She responded promptly, provided good advice on safari lodgings options and worked up a couple of itinerary options to suit our budget. Denise also organised flights and transfers very quickly so that we could finalize our booking in a short time. Much appreciated.

> Great advice, responsive and knowledgeable!

> Pascal John at Safari.com guided me on different safari lodges (experience, rating), and most importantly knew about specials (buy 3 nights, get 4th for free) which allowed my family to secure a 5-star location at a more reasonable rate. Great advice, responsive and knowledgeable!
