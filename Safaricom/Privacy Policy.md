> Thanks Pascal you are amazing!

> From the moment we arrived in South Africa, our safari adventure was nothing short of extraordinary. Nestled in the heart of the African wilderness, we found ourselves surrounded by the breathtaking landscapes of Kruger National Park, a haven for wildlife enthusiasts. Our accommodation was luxurious yet seamlessly integrated into the natural environment, offering us stunning views of the savannah from the comfort of our private deck. Each day began with an exhilarating sunrise game drive, where our expert guide shared his deep knowledge and passion for the local wildlife. Witnessing the "Big Five" was an awe-inspiring experience that left us in complete awe of nature's magnificence. The guides were incredibly knowledgeable and made sure we felt safe while immersing ourselves in the wilderness. Evenings were equally enchanting, with sundowner drinks enjoyed against the backdrop of a fiery African sunset, followed by sumptuous dinners under the starlit sky. The cuisine was a delightful fusion of local flavors and gourmet dishes, perfectly complementing the day's adventures. The sense of community at the lodge was heartwarming. The staff were attentive, ensuring every need was met with a smile, and fellow travelers quickly became friends as we shared stories around the campfire. Our South African safari was more than just a holiday; it was a transformative journey that connected us with nature and left us with lasting memories. For anyone seeking an adventure that combines luxury, education, and unparalleled wildlife encounters, a safari in South Africa is an absolute must. We left with hearts full of gratitude and a profound appreciation for the natural world, eagerly planning our return to this magnificent land.

> Top notch service

> Catherine was very helpful and responsive. Our trip was postponed due to the pandemic and she efficiently advocated for us with the game reserves to rebook our trip. Also, the SA embassy in our region required additional police certification of our reservation, the Safari.com team went to the police station and sent us the certified documents on the same day. Amazing service. Highly recommend!

> Pascal is an outstanding Safari…

> Pascal is an outstanding Safari consultant!!!  He's very personable, warm, professional, and very detailed. He made a perfect itinerary. for my trip to Victoira Falls. I would highly recommend him at Safari Travel Agency, will not be disappointed. They are a top-notch company, and Pascal is a great asset for sure. I have traveled the world and was surprised by the level of professionalism and knowledge that I gained working with him. Being a sales professional and world traveler, I'm very picky, but they checked all the boxes. Thank you so much, and all the best.
