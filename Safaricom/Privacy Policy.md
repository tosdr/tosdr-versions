> While we have not traveled as yet

> While we have not traveled as yet, the itinerary that we developed is very exciting and we are looking forward to this experience very much. Jayson Scheffers has been a wonderfully engaged and responsive partner in developing our agenda, despite our having some needs to change travel dates and agendas during the planning process because of family illness that necessitated our changing plans.

> Great experience working with Lisa

> Great experience working with Lisa from Safari.com, provided very helpful information and came up with a detailed itinerary for our stay in Cape Town and our 3 day safari at Sanbona. Unfortunately Lisa needed to go to a hospital but the company took over the booking process and all went very smooth. We wish Lisa a quick recovery.

> 7-nights Safari

> I made a reservation for a 7-night safari trip to two specific Private Game Reserves in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, for one of the busiest months in Kruger: August. This reservation was made at the last minute. (3 days ago). A reservation that had some special features, with choices from someone who has already done (my husband and I) several safaris in other African countries. The architecture and design of the lodges are important to us on a professional level. And the Private Game Reserves had to be the best. Anja Meyer, from Safari.com, started and completed the reservation process in 4 days, two of which were weekends. Very efficient, fast and understanding what we wanted for our week in the bush. We are "addicted" to safaris, wildlife, bush, landscapes, nature... and we love Africa and the Africans. We can't wait for August to arrive. Thank you!

> My first experience a number of months…

> My first experience a number of months back wasn't as I wanted. I picked up with Dolan a little after this to find when the best time to Safari was with the chance of seeing the "big 5" and he was so helpful, guiding me to July-September. With the cooler winter months being the better chances to see more wildlife and the big five. This lead me on to deal with Jayson. Jayson has pulled out all the stops, working past 9pm Cape Town time( 8pm London UK) to help meet my needs. I travel out on 6th July and cannot wait, Thank you Dolan and Jayson.

> Sara Van Coillie has been extremely helpful in making our Namibia trip fantastic! We have emails up on emails of Sara answering all my (many) questions months and months before our trip. I've had last minute questions and requests right before and during our trip and she always responds with record time and helps us out. I feel all of our needs have been met and I couldn't be happier with Sara as our travel representative! Highly recommend her! :)

> Pascal John was very helpful with recommendations for our Safari Booking. He responded to all our emails and txt messages extremely quickly, especially given the time difference. He also sent videos of his recent experience at the lodges which was especially helpful.
