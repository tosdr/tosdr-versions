> Shann @ Safari.com is fantastic!

> We worked with Shann Shaw and she was amazing! As someone who usually books my own travel I was a little bit skeptical at first... But safaris are not like a typical vacation and there are just SO many different options. Shann was incredibly patient in answering all of my questions, and eventually found the perfect safari lodge for me and my family. I really don't think I could have done it without her help. Highly recommend working with her!

> Booking with Leigh-Ann Croeser

> Thank you for this fantastic booking experience. Leigh-Ann Croeser did everything to let my wishes become reality. I wasn’t an easy customer, but he never let me feel that. She answered very fast to all my questions and helped me with everything so that we have the most of our trip. Thank you very much for organizing our dream Safari. I can only recommend it.

> Very Responsive and Patient w/ Our Needs!

> Anja has been great in making our travel reservations! She is very quick and responsive (at all hours, I'm not sure when she sleeps)! We went back and forth on 39 emails. Yes, 39 emails for a couple of weeks. She made several different itineraries in ranging prices, types of accommodations, and locations. She was patient through the whole process and provided so much information. We finally decided on our perfect trip!

> Aquilia Safari trip

> Re: Safari from Cape Town to Aquilia. Fadiel was very helpful and organised our trip for us. We were picked up by Joe, who was our driver for the day. Joe is born and raised in Cape Town. He was prompt and was very friendly and informative. There was a good choice of food at Aquilia and had choices for my husband too who is Coeliac.
