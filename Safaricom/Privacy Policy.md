> Lindi Weeks - Safari.com. A Pleasure to Work With.

> I recently had the pleasure of working with Lindi Weeks of Safari.com to plan our dream safari, and I couldn't be happier with the experience! From start to finish, she was incredibly patient, answering every question I had and addressing all my concerns. Her knowledge of safari destinations, wildlife, and logistics is truly impressive – it’s clear she’s a seasoned expert in the field! Beyond being well-informed, Lindi is an all-around wonderful person to work with. She was understanding of our budget and needs, and she crafted an itinerary that perfectly balanced adventure, relaxation, and unique wildlife encounters. At every step, I felt like I was in great hands, knowing Lindi had thought of every detail to make our trip as memorable as possible. If you're considering a safari adventure and want someone who is knowledgeable, patient, and truly cares about making your experience unforgettable, I highly recommend Lindi

> This is the second time this year we have used Shann Shaw at Safari.com. She is outstanding in her role and is always so flexible and helpful. She literally goes beyond expectations and nothing is ever to much for her and there is never any frustrations when plans have to be re-started if flights arriving later than expected. She also comes up with wonderful ideas for trips and not just limited to Safari's but for hotels in South Africa as well. i don't normally write reviews but Shann deserves every accolade that comes her way. thank you so much - Bryan & Jo

> Our customer service rep was prompt and polite in responding to our query. She automatically included transportation to and from the safari lodge, which saved us so much time and effort and worry! Other safari companies did not provide this service. From a few questions asked she chose 3 fantastic options for us, exactly what we were looking for. She was also very patient in answering our questions about each lodge and was knowledgeable in her responses. I would highly recommend this company and am excited to go on the safari that she helped us choose!
