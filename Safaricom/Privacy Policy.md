> Incredibly helpful and experienced agent Anja

> Anja was incredibly helpful and organized the most beautiful safari for us at a small lodge and also arranged our transport. She always responded within minutes no matter the day and took time for all my questions. I will recommend anyone who is looking for a premium experience to get in contact with Anja! Thanks for everything!

> Exceptional travel agent and overall experience!!

> Leigh Ann was an exceptional travel agent who went above and beyond to make our trip to Kruger National Park, Victoria Falls, and Chobe unforgettable. Her recommendations were spot-on, and what made the experience even better was her personal perspective—insights you simply won’t find online. She shared tips that added so much value to our trip and made everything feel more meaningful. Leigh Ann was available anytime we had questions, which made us feel completely supported throughout the trip. From the initial planning stages to our return, every detail was seamless and perfectly coordinated. If you’re planning a trip to Africa, I highly recommend Leigh Ann. She truly gave us a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Thank you, Leigh Ann!
