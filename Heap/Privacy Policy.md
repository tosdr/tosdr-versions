### **HEAP GLOBAL PRIVACY POLICY**

Welcome and thank you for your interest in Heap Inc., a member of the Contentsquare Group of companies, who are listed [at this link](https://contentsquare.com/contentsquare-group-list/), (“**_Heap_**”, “**_we_**”, “**our**” or “**_us_**”). 

Heap is a SaaS  product analytics platform. We allow our customers to collect and analyze data about how their visitors are interacting with their website and mobile application to optimize performance of product usage, diagnose problems in our customer’s visitor experience, and correlate our customer’s visitor activity with long-term value. Heap does this by collecting data on what visitors are doing, including but not limited to what webpages they visit, what visitors click on, where those visitors are located, what browser or platform those visitors are using, and other  types of behavioral data. 

When we use the term “**_personal information_**” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Heap when you visit our website [https://heap.io/](https://heap.io/) (the “**_Site_**”), and/or use our SaaS product and related services (collectively, the “**_Service_**”). 

* **_Heap as a Data Controller:_** For purposes of data protection laws, Heap Inc., a company duly incorporated and organized under the laws of United States of America, having its registered address at 225 Bush St. 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104, is the “data controller” and is generally responsible for and controls the processing of your personal information collected through your use of our Service. This Privacy Policy applies only to instances where Heaps acts as a data controller. 
    
* **_Heap as a Data Processor:_** Wherever our customers use our Service to submit, manage, or otherwise use content relating to our customers’ end users during the provision of our Service, we act as a “data processor” and have contractually committed ourselves, including by signing data processing agreements, to only process such information on behalf and under the instruction of the respective customer, who is the data controller, and as provided for under the contractual agreements we sign with them. As such, this Privacy Policy does not apply to such processing.

However, some information, such as your name, address, payment transaction information, and information on your requested services may be necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations.

We and our third-party providers and partners collect certain personal information automatically when you visit or interact with our Site and Service: 

* **Log** **Data**: Including your internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser ID, the URL you entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of your visit, the time you spent on our Service and any errors that may occur during your visit.

* **_Business Partners._** We may disclose personal information to our business partners for transactional and marketing purposes, including to promote their products or services if you consent. We may also share your personal information with other third parties who may have products or services we think you may enjoy. 
    
* **_Online Advertising Partners._** We also share personal information with advertising networks or permit these partners to collect information from you directly on our websites to facilitate online advertising, such as search engines and social network advertising providers to serve targeted ads to you or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics, on third-party platforms. For more information, including how to opt out of interest-based advertising, please see our Cookie Policy [here](https://heap.io/cookies).
    
* **_Contentsquare Group._** We may share, disclose and transfer your personal information with Contentsquare Group for all purposes mentioned above. 
    
* **_Corporate Transaction._** We may transfer to third-parties any information we collect in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including any shares in the company) or any portion or combination of our products, services, businesses and/or assets. Should such a transaction occur (whether a divestiture, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, liquidation, or similar transaction or proceeding), we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that any transferred information is treated in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    
* **_Legal Requirements._** We may share your information with third parties, including government authorities or public authorities, courts, intergovernmental or supranational bodies, as required by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our [**Master Services Agreement**](https://www.heap.io/legal/heap-master-services-agreement) or other agreements or to protect the security or integrity of the Heap services, including to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with preventing fraud or illegal activity; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Heap, our Customers, visitors, or others. 
    
* **_With Your Consent._** We may disclose your information publicly or with another third party with your prior authorization. 
    

### **3\. HOW LONG WILL WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION**

We will usually keep the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out in Section 1, in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests. 

The criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:

1. **Legitimate Interests.** Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
    
2. **Consent.** Where we are processing personal information based on your consent, we generally will retain the information until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information.
    
3. **Contract.** Where we are processing personal information based on contract, we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship.
    
4. **Legal Obligation.** Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfill the legal obligation.
    
5. **Legal Claim.** We may need to apply a “legal hold” that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face a threat of legal claim.  In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
    

In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information.

#### **4\. CONTROL OVER YOUR INFORMATION**

* **_Email Communications._** From time to time, we may send you emails regarding updates to our Service, products or services, notices about our organization, or information about products/services we offer (or promotional offers from third parties) that we think may be of interest to you. If you wish to unsubscribe from such emails, simply click the “unsubscribe link” provided at the bottom of the email communication. Note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain services-related email communications (e.g., account verification, confirmations of transactions, technical or legal notices).
    
* **_Modifying Account Information._** If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to modify certain information in your account (e.g., your contact information) through the \[“profile,” “account,” “settings,” or “preferences”\] options provided on the Site. If you would like to request access to, or correction or deletion of personal information, you may send your request to us at the email provided below. .
    
* **_How to Control Push Notifications._** You can stop receiving push notifications from us by changing your preferences in the iOS or Android notifications settings menu.
    

### 5\. **LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES**

For your convenience, our Service may provide links to third-party websites or services that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Service, including the information or content contained within them.

If you are using a third-party website or service, you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site or service before providing any personal information.

### **6\. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

Our services are not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under the age of 16.

### **7\. CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account, by placing a prominent notice on our Site, or through other appropriate communication channels.

We will usually keep the personal data we collect about you for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out in Section 3.1 and 3.2, in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests. 

The criteria used to determine the period for which personal data about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal data:

1. **Legitimate Interests.** Where we are processing personal data based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such data for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
    
2. **Consent.** Where we are processing personal data based on your consent, we generally will retain the data until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information.
    
3. **Contract.** Where we are processing personal data based on contract, we generally will retain the data for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship.
    
4. **Legal Obligation.** Where we are processing personal data based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the data for the period of time necessary to fulfill the legal obligation.
    
5. **Legal Claim.** We may need to apply a “legal hold” that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face a threat of legal claim.  In that case, we will retain the data until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
