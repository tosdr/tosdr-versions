**LINKS TO OTHER SITES AND/OR MATERIALS**

As part of the Service, the Company may provide you with convenient links to third party website(s) (“Third Party Sites”) as well as content or items belonging to or originating from third parties (the “Third Party Applications, Software or Content”). These links are provided as a courtesy to Service users. The Company has no control over Third Party Sites and Third Party Applications, Software or Content or the promotions, materials, information, goods or services available on these Third Party Sites or Third Party Applications, Software or Content. Such Third Party Sites and Third Party Applications, Software or Content are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by the Company, and the Company is not responsible for any Third Party Sites accessed through the Site or any Third Party Applications, Software or Content posted on, available through or installed from the Site.

You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any site to which you navigate from the Site or relating to any applications you use or install from the site.

**TERMINATION**

Either party may terminate the Services at any time by notifying the other party. Penana Limited may also terminate or suspend any and all Services and access to the Site immediately, without prior notice or liability, if users breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. Upon termination of user's account, user’s right to use the Services, access the Site, and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, and limitations of liability. Termination of Your access to and use of the Site and the Services shall not relieve users of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability which users otherwise may have to Penana Limited or the Site, including without limitation any indemnification obligations contained herein.

**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

You retain all of your ownership rights in your User Content Submissions, but we need licenses from you to operate the Services effectively. By displaying, posting or publishing any Content on or through the Site and Services, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, sublicensable and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, distribute, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and translate such Content in connection with the Penana Website and Penana's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through any media channels.

**PURCHASED AND RENTAL CONTENT, SUBSCRIPTION AND SPONSORING**

Certain of the User Content on the Service may be subject to payments now or in the future. The payment could be on a one-off basis, or in the form of subscription model. Upon your payment of the applicable fees (including applicable taxes) for, the User Content provider grants you a non-exclusive right to view, use, and display such User Content, solely through Penana or its affiliated services or as otherwise permitted as part of the Service, and solely for your personal, non-commercial use, as long as the rights exist to provide you with that content, or during the period of time specified if there is any. The User Content is licensed, not sold, to you by the User Content Provider. Some content, such as interactive or highly formatted content, may not be available to you on your devices or applications. Purchased Content may become unavailable for viewing due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, content provider licensing and other restrictions. If your purchase includes the ability to download Purchased Content, we encourage you to download that content immediately after purchase. If an item of purchased content unexpectedly becomes unavailable within 30 days from the purchase date, you may request a refund.

For certain subscription plans, the User Content Provider may offer some "promises" on future benefits. We could not guarantee those promises could be honoured. We are not liable for loss associated with unfulfilled benefits and from losses caused by conflicting contractual agreements.

Certain of the User Content may be subject to voluntary “sponsors”, which is a way to express support and/or appreciation for the User Content providers. The payment of the fees typically would not grant you any additional rights, except otherwise specified. In some cases, you may be allowed to leave a sponsor's comment which would be relatively easily visible to the User Content provider and/or the readers of the story.

Unless specifically indicated otherwise, you may not sell, rent, lease, distribute, broadcast, sublicense, or otherwise assign any rights to the content or any portion of it to any third party. In addition, you may not attempt to bypass, modify, defeat, or otherwise circumvent any digital rights management system or other content protection or features used as part of the Service. We do not grant you any public performance, public display, commercial sale, resale, reproduction, or distribution rights for any User Content. You must comply with all applicable laws and with the terms of any licenses or agreements to which you are bound in your use of the Services.

Penana makes no representations or warranties concerning:  

* The availability of the User Content in a particular jurisdiction.
* The availability of the User Content for any particular device, operating system, or browser.
* The continued support for a particular feature of the Service.
* The quality of any User Content or the suitability of any User Content for any audience. All opinions and statements expressed by or in User Content (or related materials) are those of the User and/or persons involved in the production of the User Content, not Penana.

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed consistent with applicable law. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.

Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement. You agree that any cause of action related to or arising out of your relationship with the Company must commence within ONE year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
