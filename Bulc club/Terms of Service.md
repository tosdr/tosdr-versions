#### **Welcome to Bulc Club!** We are a free email filtering and forwarding service. Our mission is to block spam, protect your privacy, and help you organize your inbox.

These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "Bulc Club Membership," "our membership" or "the membership" means the service provided by Bulc Club for filtering and forwarding email messages, including all features and functionalities, website, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service.

If you are a resident of the United States (including its possessions and territories), you agree to the Arbitration Agreement and class action waiver described in Section 15 to resolve any disputes with Bulc Club (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court).

Please note that these Terms of Use include hyperlinks that may be accessed only through our website, so if you are reviewing these Terms of Use elsewhere, in print or a non-web-friendly device, you may need to visit [bulc.club/legal/terms](https://www.bulc.club/legal/terms) to review these hyperlinked terms.

The company that is providing the service to you (referred to as "ERA404" in these Terms of Use) and with whom you are entering into this agreement, depends on the country from which you sign up for the Bulc Club service. Check back as the service provider may change from time to time.

You are responsible for updating and maintaining the truth and accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account.
    2. In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer the Bulc Club service, Bulc Club implements technology that enables us to recognize you as the Account Owner and provide you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the Bulc Club service.

    4. You should be mindful of any communication requesting that you submit credit card or other account information. Providing your information in response to these types of communications can result in identity theft. Always access your sensitive account information by going directly to the Bulc Club website and not through a hyperlink in an email or any other electronic communication, even if it looks official. Bulc Club reserves the right to place any account on hold anytime with or without notification to the member in order to protect itself and its partners from what it believes to be fraudulent activity. As Bulc Club is free, there will be no credits, payments, or reimbursements on membership for holds placed on the account by either a representative of Bulc Club or by the automated processes of Bulc Club.
8. **Disclaimers of Warranties and Limitations on Liability**
    1. THE BULC CLUB SERVICE AND ALL CONTENT AND SOFTWARE ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BULC CLUB SERVICE, ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. BULC CLUB DOES NOT GUARANTEE, REPRESENT, OR WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE BULC CLUB SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. BULC CLUB SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR THE USE OF APPLICATIONS, DEVICES, AND SOFTWARE (INCLUDING THEIR CONTINUING COMPATIBILITY WITH OUR SERVICE). For example, email may not be forwarded immediately, or at all, in the case that it is improperly formatted/encoded, contains vulnerabilities or viruses, exceeds size limitations, includes prohibited attachments/code, or experiences other unforeseen circumstances. Bulc Club cannot be held liable to those seeking immediate and reliable mail forwarding and recommends users seek alternate services that can accommodate this need.
    2. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, IN NO EVENT SHALL BULC CLUB, OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY OF THEIR SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE (JOINTLY OR SEVERALLY) TO YOU FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER.
    3. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    4. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.

    2. If you are a resident of Brazil, these Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Brazil.

11. **Applications.** You may encounter third-party applications (including, without limitation, websites, widgets, software, or other software utilities) ("Application(s)") that interact with the Bulc Club service. These Applications may import data related to your Bulc Club account and activity and otherwise gather data from you. These Applications are provided solely as a convenience to you, and Bulc Club is not responsible for such Applications. SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE OWNED OR OPERATED BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO WITH OR SPONSORED BY BULC CLUB AND MAY NOT BE AUTHORIZED FOR USE WITH OUR SERVICE IN ALL COUNTRIES. USE OF AN APPLICATION IS AT YOUR OWN OPTION AND RISK.
12. **Use of Information Submitted.** Bulc Club is free to use any comments, information, ideas, concepts, reviews, or techniques or any other material contained in any communication you may send to us ("Feedback"), including responses to questionnaires or through postings to the Bulc Club service, including the Bulc Club website and user interfaces, without further compensation, acknowledgement or payment to you for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and creating, modifying or improving the Bulc Club service. In addition, you agree not to enforce any "moral rights" in and to the Feedback, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Should you send any unsolicited feature or product ideas, you do so with the understanding that no additional consideration of any sort will be provided to you, and you are waiving any claim against Bulc Club and its affiliates regarding the use of such ideas, even if an idea is used that is substantially similar to the idea you sent.
13. **Customer Support.** If you need assistance with your account, view Member Support options under "Resources" at the top right hand corner of our website at any time. There you will find the answers to many frequently asked questions and information on reaching a live Customer Service representative. In certain instances, Customer Service may best be able to assist you by using a remote access support tool through which we have full access to your computer. If you do not want us to have this access, you should not consent to support through the remote access tool, and we will assist you through other means. In the event of any conflict between these Terms of Use and information provided by Customer Support or other portions of our website, these Terms of Use will control.
14. **Arbitration Agreement**
    1. If you are a Bulc Club member in the United States (including its possessions and territories), you and Bulc Club agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Bulc Club service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Bulc Club are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Bulc Club membership.
    2. If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Bulc Club, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice"). The Notice to Bulc Club must be addressed to: General Counsel, ERA404 Creative Group, Inc., PO Box 470404, Brooklyn, NY 11247 ("Notice Address"). If Bulc Club initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your membership account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Bulc Club, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Bulc Club and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Bulc Club may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.
    3. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Bulc Club receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Bulc Club will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$5,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.
    4. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless Bulc Club and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your residence.
    5. If your claim is for US$5,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US$5,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Bulc Club's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Bulc Club did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Bulc Club will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
    6. YOU AND BULC CLUB AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Bulc Club agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
