### Introduction

This privacy notice explains the information we collect, how we use and share it, how to exercise rights you may have in connection with our websites (including, but not limited to, [www.1Password.com](http://www.1password.com/), [www.1Password.eu](https://1password.com/sign-up/eu/) and [www.1Password.ca](https://1password.com/sign-up/ca/)) and the related applications and services (collectively, the “Services”) operated by Agilebits Inc. doing business as 1Password (“1Password”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”) including our affiliated companies unless otherwise noted. Please also read our [Terms of Service](https://1password.com/legal/terms-of-service/), which sets out the terms governing the Services.

1Password processes your information both for our own business purposes (as a “controller”) and in connection with our Services offered to business customers (as a “processor”). This privacy notice applies when 1Password is the controller of your personal data, unless otherwise noted. Where we provide our Services under contract with an organization (for example, your employer), that organization is the controller of your information processed by the Services. We refer to information processed in connection with our Services offered to organizations as “Customer Data.” For more information, please see the Notice to End Users, which explains our privacy practices when we are a data processor. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the extent we process your information in the role of a processor on behalf of such organizations.

Sometimes, we work with other companies and our affiliates to bring our customers and our customer’s end-users an unbeatable experience. This policy does not apply to products or services offered by third-parties, or services offered under the Kolide, Inc., brand, each of which has its own terms and conditions and privacy policies (see [Kolide Privacy](https://www.kolide.com/legal/privacy)). You should carefully read each third-party’s privacy policies and any terms and conditions applicable to the product or service you use.

### Who We Are and Our Commitment to Privacy

1Password is a Canadian company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. As the controller of your information, we believe in holding ourselves accountable to you. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices or this Privacy Notice, you can reach us by using the information provided in the Contact Us section.

### Who are You

We collect personal information about three categories of people: Individuals, Business Account Owners, and Business End Users.

1. **Individuals**. These are people who visit our site, interact with our content or marketing, or use our Services directly using an individual or family account. This Privacy Notice applies to your information.
    
2. **Business Account Owners**. These are people who represent an organization that uses 1Password Services through Business accounts. We collect and use your contact information as described in this Privacy Notice.

### Information you provide to us

We collect information about you when you input it into the Services or otherwise make it available directly to us through your use of our Services.

**Contact Information.** We collect your contact details and keep records of your interactions with us. For example, when you provide feedback, participate in a survey, attend our webinars, or request more information about our products and services. Our records may include the following: your name, email, address, phone number, preferred contact method, job title, company name, company size, your responses to our surveys, events attended, and any products or services where you have expressed your interest to us.

**Secure Data is the data you pay us to protect.** It includes the information you decide to store within your vaults in your 1Password accounts. Your Secure Data is your property. We claim no rights to it beyond those necessary to deliver Services to you. You may add, modify, and delete Secure Data at your discretion.

Secure Data is encrypted using secure cryptographic keys that exist only in the possession and under the control of users or admins of their accounts. We have no way of accessing or sharing Secure Data in a readable format or decrypting it, and we never receive copies of unencrypted Secure Data.

**Service Data** is the information 1Password collects or generates during the provision and administration of our Services and related technical support, excluding any Customer Data. Service Data includes, but is not limited to:

* **Account Information.** We collect information you provide when creating your profile and setting up your 1Password account (for example, your name, email, administrator contact details, vault names, your location, and any images that you may have uploaded as part of your profile). If you set up trusted devices or browsers, we collect identifiers and details about them to distinguish them from any others you might use to access the Service. If you created a Family account, we collect details like family names, email addresses, and any other information your invited guests may have provided us to set up their accounts.
    
* **Payment Information.** We use a Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant third-party payment processor, to collect and secure your payment method, payment card details, and billing information when you sign up for the Services. Where required by law, we keep business records related to any contracts, charges, payments, refunds, taxes, or billing issues.
    
* **Support Data and Communications.** We keep records of your communications with us. Our Services include technical support, so when you communicate with us (via email, phone, websites, social media, chatbots, or otherwise) we collect your contact information, a description or summary of your problem and any other documentation or technical information we might need to help diagnose or resolve your issue. If you communicate with us via a chatbot or use our automated communication tools to facilitate your communications with us, including those offered by a third-party, these tools may collect and record the contents of any communications you send through them. They may also collect analytics information, such as device and usage information. We may disclose this information to our relevant service providers for the purpose of providing these tools, improving our customer support, generating summaries, and internal marketing purposes.
    
* **Webinars, Trainings, Contests, and Event or Program Data.** Data you provide to us when you register for any of our events, contests, webinars, whitepaper downloads, and surveys; or share your attendee information with us as part of a conference or seminar.

### Legal Bases

If you are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, our legal bases for collecting and using personal data as described in this Privacy Notice depends on the personal data and the specific context in which we collect it. In some cases, we may rely on multiple legal bases to process your data. For example, our legal bases to process your personal data include:

* Performance of contract with you, such as to provide and maintain our Services for your use. It is necessary for us to process your Contact Information, Secure Data, Service Data and Diagnostic Data to provide, improve, and secure our Services for you.
    
* In furtherance of our legitimate interests, we process your Contact Information, Service Data, and Diagnostic Data, to develop and train new technology, to analyze and improve our existing services, and to customize content used for our marketing purposes. Where we are using your information because we or our customers (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.
    
* With your consent, such as when you tell us we may use your location or non-essential cookies and similar technologies. When we process your information based on your consent you may revoke your consent at any time, in some cases this may not affect any processing that has already taken place.
    
* To comply with a legal obligation, including to prosecute, exercise, or defend a lawsuit, arbitration, or similar legal proceeding, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities (including national security or law enforcement requests).
    

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the information we collect is reliable, accurate, complete, and current for its intended use. If you would like to find out more about the specific legal basis we rely on to process your data for a particular purpose (including any legitimate interests we have in processing that information), please contact us as detailed in the [Contact Us](https://1password.com/legal/privacy#contact-us) section.

HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION

We share your Personal Information as described below and in this Privacy Notice, and as permitted by applicable law.

**AgileBits Inc. Affiliated Companies.** We may share your information within the AgileBits companies and in some cases, with prospective affiliates to operate, improve, and market affiliated services to you. This includes affiliate companies that own, operate, or enable us to provide the Services to you. Unless you are notified otherwise, information shared with corporate affiliates will remain subject to this Privacy Notice.

**Account Organizer.** Our Services allow you to create accounts on behalf of other individuals though Family accounts. When you create an account on behalf of someone else, we refer to you as an account organizer.

**Service Providers.** We share information with third-parties in connection with the delivery of Services to you and the operation of our business. These third-party service providers are required to protect information we share with them and may not use any identifying information other than to provide services we contracted them to provide. They are not allowed to use the information we share for purposes of their own direct marketing (unless you have separately consented with the third-party under the terms provided by the third-party).

**Marketing Partners.** We may disclose your information to third-party marketing services which help us advertise our services to you. This may be considered a sale or sharing personal information data under applicable privacy laws.

We will comply with applicable laws and the contracts with our customers to provide Service Data and encrypted Secure Data to law enforcement agencies. If permitted, we will notify you of such a request and whether or not we have complied.

We will deidentify, aggregate, or otherwise remove or mask your personal information if we intend to use it for analytical purposes or trend analysis over longer periods of time. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified, or deleted may continue to reside in our systems for a period of time, and we may maintain copies of this information as part of our business records.

INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
----------------------------

Secure Data is hosted where an Individual or Business customer chooses (currently either in the EU, US, or Canada), except to the extent a user utilizes the Item Sharing function in which case the data will be stored in the EU as long as the item is shared.

Service Data, Diagnostic Data, and other information we process may be accessed from, processed, or transferred to countries other than the country in which you reside or in which the data is hosted. Our employees may access your information from various countries around the world. Those countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.

Our customer support and email services are hosted primarily in the United States and Canada. Any information you choose to send us through email or our customer support system may pass through and be stored on a variety of intermediate services. If you wish, you may encrypt email to us using our [PGP public key](https://1password.com/support-at-agilebits-pubkey-42F3D4D4.asc).

We have taken appropriate steps and put safeguards in place to help ensure that any access, processing, or transfer of your information remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice and in compliance with applicable data protection law. Such measures provide your information with a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that under the equivalent local law in your country, no matter where your data is accessed from, processed, or transferred.

Such measures include the following:

* Adequacy decisions of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection countries outside the European Union.
    
* Ensuring that the third-party partners, vendors, and service providers to whom data transfers are made have appropriate mechanisms in place to protect your Personal Information. For instance, our agreements signed with our third-party partners, vendors and service providers incorporate strict data transfer terms (including, where applicable, model clauses issued by the European Commission or the United Kingdom for restricted transfers to third countries), and require all contracting parties to protect the Personal Information they process in accordance with applicable data protection law. Our agreements with our third-party partners, vendors, and service providers may also include, where applicable, their certification under approved privacy frameworks, or reliance on the service provider's Binding Corporate Rules, as defined by the European Commission.
    
* Carrying out periodic risk assessments and implementing various technological and organization measures to ensure compliance with relevant laws on data transfer.

If you use 1Password services with an account provided by your employer or an organization that you are affiliated with, that organization is the controller of your information and the administrator of your account. We refer to personal data processed in connection with our Services offered to businesses as “Customer Data.” We only process Customer Data to fulfill our contractual obligations, or as otherwise instructed by our business customers.

As an end user of a Business product, your information is subject to the privacy information provided to you by your organization. We recommend that you review your internal privacy policies prior to creating an account with us.

Your account administrator manages your 1Password account and any information associated with your account. This means that your account administrator can access and process your data, including insights derived from how you use and interact with the Services and any privacy controls associated with your account. Your account administrator controls which services you may access using your account, and can turn off particular services at their discretion. Your account administrator can also delete your account, recover your account and vault contents, or restrict you from accessing any data associated with your account.

If you have created a free Family or Individual account provided by your account administrator, your personal account is covered by the 1Password Terms and Privacy Notice and cannot be accessed or processed by your account administrator. If you lose access to the organization that you are affiliated with (for example, if you change your employment), you may lose access to 1Password Business products, including your employee vaults and the information contained within those vaults.
