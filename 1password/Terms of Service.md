Service Agreement for 1Password users and customers

Last updated: September 12, 2024
--------------------------------

Terms of Use for 1Password Individual Users
-------------------------------------------

These Terms of Use (“Terms” “Terms of Use” “Agreement” or “Service Agreement”) govern your relationship with the 1Password Service (the “Service”) operated by AgileBits Inc. (“us” “we” or “our”). It is important that you read this carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms.

Your access to and use of the Service is based on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, free trial users, and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms and accept all legal consequences. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in whole or in part, please do not use the Service.

Description of Service
----------------------

The “Service” means (a) AgileBits' password managing, secure document storing, administrative and related systems and technologies, as well as the website [https://1password.com](https://1password.com/) (the “Site”), and (b) all software (including the Software, as defined below), applications, data, text, images, and other content made available by or on behalf of AgileBits. Any modifications to the Service are also subject to these Terms. AgileBits reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service or any feature or functionality thereof at any time without notice. All rights, title and interest in and to the Service will remain with and belong exclusively to AgileBits.

Subscriptions
-------------

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set on a regular basis, typically monthly or yearly.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it or AgileBits Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting AgileBits Inc. customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide AgileBits Inc. or its third-party payment processor, with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize AgileBits Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. All amounts paid are non-refundable. You further agree to be responsible for all taxes associated with the Service, along with any transaction fees and currency conversions added by your financial institution and intermediaries. All amounts are in US Dollars.

Free Trial
----------

AgileBits Inc. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”).

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by AgileBits Inc. until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, AgileBits Inc. reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

Fee Changes
-----------

AgileBits Inc., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

AgileBits Inc. will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

Refunds
-------

While all amounts paid are non-refundable, certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by AgileBits Inc. on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of AgileBits Inc..

Accounts
--------

When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third party service.

You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

Termination
-----------

You are entitled to cease using our Services at any time and for any reason without notice to us, but you will continue to be charged for Services until you cancel your account by logging in or contacting us.

Our duty is to keep our Service as safe and well maintained as possible. To this end, we may need to terminate accounts for violations of these Terms. In the following circumstances we will provide notice to you prior to termination of your account: (a) you are in breach of these Terms; or (b) you are using our Services in a way that can cause or has caused a risk of harm or loss to either AgileBits or our other customers.

In such an event our notice will be via email to all or any of the registered account holders, which includes but is not limited to “Family Organizers” and “Team Owners” as they are listed in your account at the time of notice. If you remedy the issues that cause us to send the notice, to our satisfaction, then we will not terminate your access or license to our Services. If you do not remedy the outstanding causes of our termination notice in these circumstances, then we will terminate your account. In the event of such a termination we will provide you with the ability to take your data with you.

There are three very limited circumstances in which we will be unable to send notice to you prior to terminating your access to our Services: (i) you are in material breach of these Terms in such a way as to immediately and seriously endanger us and other users; (ii) we are unable to send you notice because this would cause us legal liability or a disruption to our Service; and (iii) we are unable to notify you due to law.

In no event will 1Password have any obligation or liability under this paragraph for any Claim or action under any legal theory if the Claim or action is caused by, or results from: (i) Customer's combination, operation or use of the Service with software or other materials not supplied by 1Password, (ii) any alteration or modification of the Services by Customer, (iii) Customer's continued allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being provided modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (iv) the actions or omissions of any person or entity other than 1Password.

**7.2 Remedy for Infringement.** Should Customer's right to use the Services pursuant to this Agreement be subject to a Claim of infringement or if 1Password reasonably believes such a Claim of infringement may arise, 1Password may, at its option and in its sole discretion (i) procure for Customer the right to continue to access and use the Services; (ii) modify the Service to render it non-infringing but substantially functionally equivalent to the Services prior to such modification; or (iii) if the alternatives described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph are not commercially practicable, then 1Password may terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer any amounts pre-paid by Customer for the Services for the unused portion of the Subscription Term.

**7.3 Customer Indemnification.** Customer agrees to defend 1Password against any Claims made or brought against 1Password by a third party alleging that the Customer Data or any other information provided by Customer to 1Password for use in connection with the Services, infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of a third party and to indemnify 1Password from any damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction against 1Password or amounts agreed to in settlement in connection with any such Claim. Customer's obligations under this paragraph shall only apply to the extent that: (a) 1Password promptly notifies Customer in writing of the Claim; (b) Customer has control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations relating to the Claim, provided however the settlement of any Claim shall not be made without advance written permission of 1Password, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; and (c) 1Password provides Customer with the assistance, information and authority reasonably necessary to perform the foregoing. 1Password shall promptly provide Customer with written notice of any Claim which 1Password believes falls within the scope of this Section. 1Password's failure to provide written notice to Customer shall not affect Customer's indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that Customer is materially prejudiced thereby. At any time after Customer becomes aware of any such Claim, Customer may procure for 1Password the right to continue to use the information for use in connection with the Services at its own expense. 1Password shall not be responsible for any delay or disruption to the Customer's use of the Services, including any damages stemming therefrom, caused by a Claim falling under this section.

8\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
----------------------------

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 5 (CONFIDENTIALITY) AND SECTION 7 (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT SHALL 1PASSWORD 'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF MONEY PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE SERVICE DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE INCIDENT. WITH RESPECT TO ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 7 (INDEMNIFICATION) ABOVE, THE LIABILITY OF 1PASSWORD TO CUSTOMER FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES PAID (OR PAYABLE) BY CUSTOMER TO 1PASSWORD HEREUNDER. THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT LIMIT THE PARTIES' PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 3 ABOVE. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO 1PASSWORD HEREUNDER REFLECT THE ALLOCATION OF RISK SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT 1PASSWORD WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THE LIMITATIONS ON ITS LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION. THESE LIABILITY LIMITATIONS APPLY EVEN IF CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

9\. TERM AND TERMINATION
------------------------

**9.1 Term of Agreement.** Subject to Section 9.2 below, this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues until the expiration of the Subscription Term specified in the Order Form. Except if the Parties have agreed and stated otherwise in an Order Form, this Agreement and the Order Form shall automatically renew. The Parties may renew an Order Form for changes to the pricing, the number of Users, change in Services from Teams to Business accounts etc.

**9.2 Termination for Cause.** A Party may terminate this Agreement for cause (i) upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other Party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period, or (ii) if the other Party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time Customer is not satisfied with 1Password's implementation services or setup of the Services or otherwise believes that 1Password has failed to satisfactorily complete the setup of the Services, then Customer's sole remedy shall be to notify 1Password of the failure or its dissatisfaction and 1Password shall then use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the implementation services or to properly setup the Services. If the Parties agree that 1Password is unable to complete the setup of the Services as originally agreed by the Parties under this Agreement and related Order Form, then Customer may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to 1Password.

**9.3 Refund or Payment upon Termination.** Upon any termination for cause by Customer, and subject to any adjustment under Section 3.1, 1Password shall refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the unused portion of the Subscription Term. Upon any termination for cause by 1Password, Customer shall pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term after the effective date of termination. In no event shall any termination relieve the Customer of its obligation to pay any fees payable to 1Password for any period prior to the effective date of termination.

**9.4 Surviving Provisions.** Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.4, 10 and 11 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

10\. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW
------------------------

**10.1 Compliance.** Each Party shall comply with the export laws and regulations of Canada, United States and other applicable jurisdictions in providing and using the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of 1Password and Customer represents that it is not named on any U.S. government list of persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports, and (ii) Customer shall not permit Users to access or use Service in violation of any U.S. export embargo, prohibition or restriction.

In addition, 1Password and the Customer shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidance (whether or not legally binding) of competent regulators in respectively the provision of and use of the Services, including without limitation the Directive 2002/58/EC, Directive 95/46/EC (and applicable implementing legislation in EU member-states) and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) and any legislation at the EU level or national level in any jurisdiction currently part of the European Economic Area which amends or replaces any of the foregoing and where applicable, the Canadian federal CAN-SPAM ACT OF 2003 (**CAN-SPAM**), the California Consumer Protection Act, and the HIPAA. Notwithstanding with the foregoing, the Customer shall comply with 1Password’s data processing terms available at: [https://1Password.com/legal](https://1password.com/legal-center).

**10.2 Surviving Provisions.** All emails built and/or sent by or on behalf of Customer using the Service must include a built-in unsubscribe link. Clicking unsubscribe links in the Service will flag an email address of a contact in Customer's database as an "Opt-Out" and prevent sending of email to that contact email address in the future. Physical mailing addresses are required for all emails sent through the Service by CAN-SPAM. Customer shall remove all contacts that have elected to unsubscribe via US mail within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of the written request or earlier where required under applicable law. 1Password subscribes to major feedback loops and automatically unsubscribes all recipients who have registered complaints if and when 1Password has sufficient information to do so.

11\. GENERAL PROVISIONS
