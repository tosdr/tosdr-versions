10\. Children and Young Peoples' Privacy Guidelines
---------------------------------------------------

10.1. Spellzone exists to serve educators, parents and students and strives to provide a safe, positive experience for children. We have audited our compliance with the [Children’s Code](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/childrens-information/childrens-code-guidance-and-resources/introduction-to-the-childrens-code/) and are pleased to say that Spellzone meets its requirements. To help ensure this, we adhere to the following policies:

* We have a dedicated [Children and Young Peoples' Privacy Policy](https://www.spellzone.com/pages/policies/child-friendly-privacy-policy.cfm) to support children’s awareness of the processing of their personal data.
* We request confirmation that a user is over the age of 18 before they sign up for a Spellzone free trial or subscription or that they have parental or guardian consent to do so.
* We do not distribute any personally identifiable information about children to third parties.
* We do not allow students to publicly post or distribute personally identifiable contact information.
* We try to avoid providing access links to any websites that request personal information, such as user email or physical addresses:
    * We remove hyper-links from posted information, for example word list descriptions.
* We do not use the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to entice children to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.

11\. Children and the risks of use of the Internet and the Website
------------------------------------------------------------------

11.1. We are concerned about the safety and privacy of our users, particularly children. Any adult or organisation using Spellzone, suggesting the use of Spellzone for children and/or directing or assigning students to use Spellzone should be aware of the many risks of using the internet and take appropriate protective measures.

11.2. Some of these online risks include but are not limited to the possibility that students can be exposed to obscene or profane materials, that students might be directed through links to websites that try to solicit personally identifying information, that malicious computer viruses, code or other "malware" can attach itself to a user's computer through emails, downloads and website visits, and the possibility that any information transmitted across the internet cannot be guaranteed to be entirely private and secure. Although the services provided by Spellzone have measures in place for removing external links, malware and obscene or profane language they are provided on an "as-is" basis.

11.3. Teachers/parents who wish to allow their child(ren) access to and use of the Website/Service should consider supervision of such access and use. By allowing your child(ren) access to the Services you are allowing your child(ren) access to all of the Services. It is therefore your responsibility to determine which Services are appropriate for your child(ren). Always use caution when revealing personally identifiable information about yourself or your child(ren) via any of the Services.

12\. The Service
----------------

12.1. The contents of the Service are only for general information or use. They do not constitute advice and should not be relied upon in making (or refraining from making) any decision.

12.2. We use reasonable care to make sure that the information appearing on the Service is accurate and up to date. However, errors and omissions can occur and you should not take the accuracy of the information for granted.

12.3. Because we do not have control over the use that may be made of the information provided through the Service, we exclude (to the fullest extent permitted at law) all warranties, express or implied, as to the quality, accuracy, timeliness, completeness, performance, or fitness for a particular purpose of the Service or any of its contents. In particular we make no warranty or representation that:

12.3.1. the Service will meet your requirements;

12.3.2. the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error free;

12.3.3. the results that may be obtained from the use of the Service will be accurate or reliable;

12.3.4. the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through the Service will meet your expectations;

12.3.5. the contents of the Service are free from infection by viruses or anything else which has contaminating or destructive properties; or

12.3.6. any errors in the software contained within the Service will be corrected.

12.4. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained by you through the use of the Service is done at your own discretion and risk and on the basis that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material.

13\. Service Access
-------------------

13.1. We endeavour to ensure that the Website is available 24 hours a day with at least 99.9% uptime in any calendar month.

If we do not meet 99.9% uptime, we will credit customer accounts with the equivalent amount of downtime, upon request. Downtime credits may not be exchanged for monetary amounts.

13.2. Downtime credits may not be issued for circumstances beyond our control such as failure of a transmission link.  
See [Our Liability Clause 22.4](#22).

14\. Technical and Organisational Measures
------------------------------------------

Spellzone Limited will adopt physical, technical, and organisational measures to ensure the security of Personal Data. This includes the prevention of loss or damage, unauthorised alteration, access or processing, and other risks to which it may be exposed by virtue of human action or the physical or natural environment. A summary of the Personal Data related security measures is provided below:

* Prevent unauthorised persons from gaining access to data processing systems in which Personal Data are processed.
* Prevent persons entitled to use a data processing system from accessing Personal Data beyond their needs and authorisations.
* Ensure that Personal Data in the course of electronic transmission during transport cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorisation.
* Ensure that access logs are in place to establish whether, and by whom, the Personal Data was entered into, modified on or removed from a data processing system.
* Ensure that in the case where processing is carried out by a Data Processor, the data can be processed only in accordance with the instructions of the Data Controller.
* Ensure that Personal Data is protected against undesired destruction or loss.
* Ensure that Personal Data collected for different purposes can and is processed separately.
* Ensure that Personal Data is not kept longer than necessary

15\. Changes to the Website
---------------------------

15.1. The information on the Website may be incomplete, out of date or inaccurate, may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors and be subject to occasional 'downtime'. Spellzone reserves the right to update the Website at our sole discretion. Thus, such information may be changed, updated or removed without notice.

16\. Material Submitted by Users
--------------------------------

16.1. Spellzone has taken a number of measures to prevent the posting of profanity or other objectionable language on the website. For instance, we automatically drop known profane terms from all lists. However, no protective measures can be fool-proof.

162\. Spellzone provides spelling practice on the website where registered users can post word lists. We do not accept any responsibility for the content or accuracy of such material. Where the material is based on or contains extracts owned by third parties, we do not make any representation or warranty that the material is provided without infringing the rights of the third party.

16.3. To maximize privacy and security, we require users to set up accounts if they wish to post word lists or comments.  

16.4. Spellzone has no method for verifying whether someone who registers as a teacher at a particular school is truly that teacher or works at that school. It is therefore possible for a person to register and post while posing as a teacher or parent when they are not actually a teacher or parent. It is actually common on the internet for people to register using false information about themselves.

16.5. All Spellzone users should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate precautions. When made aware of a fraudulent account, Spellzone will take measures to ban that user. However, these measures are limited to closing the particular account and banning future registrations using the particular email.

16.6. You agree that you will not upload files or content that contains software or other materials protected by intellectual property laws unless you own or control all of the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents.

16.7. You are not permitted to post or transmit to or from the Service any unlawful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic or profane material or any other material which could give rise to any civil or criminal liability.

16.8. You must not conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters or falsify any author attributions or other proprietary designations or do anything that might restrict or prohibit other users from using the Service.

16.9. You must not upload files that are technically harmful (including, without limitation, computer viruses, logic bombs, Trojan horses, worms, harmful components, corrupted data or other malicious software or harmful data) that may damage the operation of our or any third party's computer.

16.10. You may not misuse the Website (including, without limitation, by hacking).

16.11. We reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law or legal process or government request or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials at our discretion.

17\. Copyright and Trademarks
-----------------------------

17.1. All materials on this Website are the copyright of Spellzone or are reproduced with permission from other copyright owners. Those works are protected by copyright laws and treaties around the world. All rights are reserved.

Copying or reproducing software to any other server or location is expressly prohibited.
