Introduction
------------

Spellzone Limited treats the privacy of its customers very seriously and we take appropriate measures to safeguard your privacy. This Privacy Notice explains how we protect and use any Personal Data\* you share with us and that we hold about you, including how we collect, process, protect and share that data.  

_\* This document refers to Personal Data, which is defined as information concerning any living person (a natural person who hereafter will be called the Data Subject)._

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seeks to protect and enhance the rights of Data Subjects. These rights cover the safeguarding of Personal Data, protection against the unlawful processing of Personal Data and the unrestricted movement of personal data within the EU. It should be noted that GDPR does not apply to information already in the public domain.  

GDPR means General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (GDPR) and any national implementing laws, regulations and secondary legislation, as amended or updated from time to time, in the UK; and then any successor legislation to the GDPR or the Data Protection Act 1998.

The Information Commissioners (ICO) guidance on personal data can be found [here](https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/).

Spellzone Limited will process Personal Data during the duration of a free trial or paid subscription and will retain the Personal Data for a maximum of 18 months after the free trial and/or a paid subscription has expired.  

This will enable reinstatement of the account in the event of change of mind or absence due to illness. During this time Spellzone may contact the Data Subject regarding renewal or any special offers.  

At the end of, or before the end of the 18 months retention period, Spellzone shall destroy all documents, processing and utilization results, and data sets related to the contract that have come into its possession, in a data-protection compliant manner. The same applies to any and all connected test, waste, redundant and discarded material.  

Spellzone Limited will continue to store only the Personal Data needed after the contract has expired to meet any legal obligations after which it will be deleted, in a data-protection compliant manner.  

Some data such as word lists or results may remain on the Spellzone databases after account deletion but will not be identifiable to any Personal Data.

"Thank goodness for Spellzone during this remote learning phase. The site is easy for students to navigate independently and they're really enjoying the activities and spelling games. You get an awful lot for your money with Spellzone. Really reassuring is the very prompt response with helpdesk queries. I've very rarely needed the helpdesk, but when I have, the issue has been addressed and sorted within a very short time."
