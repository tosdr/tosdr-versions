**Business transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Coinstats or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will be one of the transferred assets.

**Protection of Coinstats and others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or with our regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Coinstats, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.

We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
