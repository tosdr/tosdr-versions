7. Cross-border data transfer

We may share your personal information with recipients located in countries other than your own. These countries may have different data protection laws than those in your jurisdiction. When we transfer your data internationally, we implement appropriate safeguards to ensure its protection.

More Details on International Data Transfers:

Transfers within CoinStats Affiliates: We transfer data between CoinStats affiliated companies based on our global data protection principles. These are internally binding regulations that commit all CoinStats Affiliates to protect your data and comply with data protection obligations.

In particular, CoinStats [complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss–U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000008RfMAAU) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU to the U.S.

Other International Transfers: We may transfer your data to recipients worldwide. When transferring data from the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, or Switzerland to countries outside the EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place or that the transfer is otherwise permitted by law.

Some countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate data protection. These currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for certain organizations), Switzerland (for transfers from the EEA), Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, South Korea, UK, USA (under the Data Privacy Framework), and Uruguay.

For other countries, we implement necessary safeguards, such as using standard contractual clauses (2021/914/EU) adopted by the European Commission, or other legally approved measures.

We continually reassess these measures to ensure compliance with new regulations and legal precedents.

8. Security Measures

We take the security of your personal information seriously and have implemented a range of technical and organizational safeguards to protect it. Our goal is to minimize risks such as data loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. Here's how we protect your data:

* **Network Security:** We use advanced network security services to guard against external threats and unauthorized access attempts.
    
* **Data Encryption:** Your data is encrypted, making it unreadable to anyone who doesn't have the decryption key.
    
* **Physical Security:** Our data centers have strict physical access restrictions, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the facilities where your data is stored.
    
* **Logical Access Controls:** We implement robust access controls for our systems and data. This means that even within our organization, only those who need access to perform their job functions can view or handle your data.
    
* **Regular Updates:** We continually review and update our security measures to address new and emerging threats.
    
* **Employee Training:** Our staff receives regular training on data protection and security best practices.
    
* **Incident Response:** We have procedures in place to quickly detect and respond to any potential security incidents.
    

While no system is completely impenetrable, these measures significantly enhance the protection of your personal information. We remain vigilant and committed to safeguarding your data throughout its lifecycle within our systems. You use the Services at your own risk.

9. Data Breach notification

In the event of a data breach that is likely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify you without undue delay, and no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach. This notification will include:

* A description of the nature of the personal data breach
    
* The name and contact details of our data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained
    
* The likely consequences of the personal data breach
    
* The measures taken or proposed to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects
    

We will provide this notification directly to you via email, unless doing so would involve disproportionate effort. In such cases, we will make a public communication or use a similar measure to ensure you are informed in an equally effective manner. If the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms, we may not notify you directly, but we will document the breach internally and inform the relevant supervisory authority as required by law. We maintain and regularly update our data breach response plan to ensure swift and effective action in case of any security incidents involving your personal data.
