In addition, certain Services (as indicated on this website) have a service specific Acceptable Use Policy which applies to such Service in addition to this AUP.

Neocities supports unrestricted transfer of information and ideas over the Internet and does not actively monitor use of the Services under normal circumstances. Similarly, we generally do not exercise editorial control over the content of any Web site, electronic mail transmission, newsgroup, or other material created or accessible over or through the Services. However, in accordance with our Internet Services Terms and Conditions, we may remove any materials that, in our sole discretion, may be illegal, may arguably subject us to liability, or which may violate this AUP or any additional service specific AUP. Neocities will cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of any suspected or alleged crime. Neocities will also respond to any subpoena, court order or other legal process if we are legally compelled to do so. Your violation of this AUP may result in the suspension or termination of either your access to the Services and/or your Neocities account or other actions as detailed in Section III. Such action may be taken with or without notice depending on the severity of the violation and at Neocities' sole discretion. This AUP should be read in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions, service specific AUPs and any other policies. Neocities reserves the right to amend, revise or modify this AUP (or any service specific AUP) at any time and such amendment, revision or modification shall be effective upon the inclusion of such in text of this AUP (or service specific AUP) and use of the Services thereafter.

Neocities does not assume the responsibility to actively monitor communications provided by users or from outside sources.
