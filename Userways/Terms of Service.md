UserWay Service
---------------

When the AI-Widget is embedded into Licensee’s Website, Licensee’s Website will become substantially more accessible in accordance with the provisions of the WCAG Standard, with little-to-no intervention required by the Licensee’s Website administrator(s), developer(s) and/or end-users.
