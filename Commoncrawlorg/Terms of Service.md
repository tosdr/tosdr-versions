Terms of Use  

===============

LAST UPDATED: March 7, 2024  
  
Welcome to the commoncrawl.org website (the "Site"). The Common Crawl Foundation ("CC", "we", or "us") established the Site and the databases, tools and information we collected and developed using the ccBot crawler, including the Crawled Content (as defined below) (all of the foregoing, collectively with the Site, the "Service") for anyone to access a comprehensive crawl of the Internet for the purpose of enabling a new wave of innovation, education and research.

To help us preserve our mission statement and to properly balance the interests of our users and the owners of the websites that the Service has crawled, we have established these Terms of Use ("ToU"). The ToU describe the terms and conditions applicable to your access and use of the Site and the Service.

Your use of the Site, the Service, or the Crawled Content signifies that you agree to the ToU and constitutes your binding acceptance of the ToU, including any modifications that we make from time to time. We may include links to the ToU in the Crawled Content, and, for the avoidance of doubt, your use of the Crawled Content signifies your binding acceptance of the ToU.

We may amend the ToU at any time by posting the amended Terms of Use on the Site, and, by continuing to use the Service or Crawled Content after we make such modifications, you agree that you will be subject to the modified ToU.  If you do not agree to the modified terms, you should discontinue your use of the Service and the Crawled Content. For your convenience, the date of last revision is included at the top of this page.

We may make changes to the Site and/or the Service at any time. You understand that we may discontinue or restrict your use of the Site and/or Service for any reason or no reason with or without notice.  If additional terms or conditions are available with or applicable to the relevant portion(s) of the Service, then those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use any such portion(s) of the Service.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THESE TERMS LIMIT OUR LIABILITY AND THAT YOU ARE RELEASING US FROM VARIOUS CLAIMS IN SECTIONS 6 AND 7 BELOW. THESE TERMS ALSO CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 11 THAT AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES.

You further agree that any improper, abusive, fraudulent, and/or illegal activity or violation of the ToU may be grounds for immediate termination of your right to continue to use the Site, the Service or Crawled Content. You further agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with the use of any Crawled Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, lawfulness or usefulness of such Crawled Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Crawled Content created or accumulated by CC.  CC strongly recommends that you obtain the advice of legal counsel before making any use, including commercial use, of the Service and/or the Crawled Content.  BY USING THE CRAWLED CONTENT, YOU AGREE TO RESPECT THE COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER APPLICABLE RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES IN AND TO THE MATERIAL CONTAINED THEREIN.

You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless CC and its officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers, employees and agents from all out-of-pocket costs, damages, losses, judgments, fines, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively, "Out-of-Pocket Costs") arising from any third-party demand, claim or proceeding (each, a "Third-Party Claim") arising from your access to, or use of, the Site, the Service or the Crawled Content, including, without limitation, any actual or alleged:  
  
(i) violation of the ToU;

(v) violation of a third party's rights against defamation, libel, slander, or other similar right, including in connection with Crawled Content, AI Systems, or Generated Content;  
  
(vi) violation of a third party's privacy or publicity rights or any other proprietary right of any third party (including, without limitation, violation of a third party's copyrights in content such as books, music (lyrics), and other creative content), including in connection with Crawled Content, AI

10\. GOVERNING LAW  

=====================

The ToU and the relationship between you and CC shall be exclusively governed by and construed in all respects under the laws of California, United States of America, without giving effect to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-laws provisions.  The English language shall prevail in the interpretation and construction of this Agreement.

11\. BINDING ARBITRATION  

===========================

Without limiting your waiver and release in Section 6, you agree to the following:  
a. Purpose. Any and all Disputes (as defined below) involving you and CC  will be resolved through individual arbitration. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less discovery and appellate review than in court. This Section 11 (the "Arbitration Provision") shall be broadly interpreted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, this Section 11 does not apply to an action by either party to enjoin the infringement or misuse of its intellectual property rights, including copyright, trademark, patent or trade secret rights.  
  
b. Definitions. The term "Dispute" means any claim or controversy related to Site, Service, and/or Crawled Content, including but not limited to any and all: (1) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (2) claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement; (3) claims that arise after the expiration or termination of these Terms; and (4) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.  As used in this Arbitration Provision, "CC" means The Common  Crawl Foundation and any of its predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and "you" means you and any users or beneficiaries of your access to the Site, Service, and/or Crawled Content.  
  
c. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with JAMS, formerly Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., ("JAMS") by visiting its website (www.jamsadr.com) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-352-5267). You may deliver any required or desired notice to CC by mail to 9663 Santa Monica Blvd. #425, Beverly Hills, CA 90210.  
  
d. Right to Sue in Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, either you or CC may bring an individual action in a small claims court in the area where you access the Site, Services, and/or the Crawled Content if the claim is not aggregated with the claim of any other person and if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.  
  
e. Arbitration Procedures. This Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "JAMS Rules") as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when you notify CC about your Dispute. You can obtain the JAMS Rules from the JAMS by visiting its website (www.jamsadr.com) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-352-5267). If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of these Terms, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the JAMS rules, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and CC agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in Los Angeles, CA.   No discovery shall be permitted.  The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator's essential findings and conclusions. The arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitrator's award. An arbitrator's award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.  
  
f. Waiver of Class Actions and Collective Relief. THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS OR USERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY'S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  
  
g. Arbitration Fees and Costs.  If the arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the payment of the JAMS's fees and costs shall be governed by the JAMS Rules and you shall reimburse CC for all fees and costs that were your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys' fees and additional costs and may only recover your attorneys' fees and costs in the arbitration to the extent that you could in court if the arbitration is decided in your favor. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, CC will pay all fees and costs that it is required by law to pay.  
  
h. Severability and Waiver of Jury Trial. If any part of subsection (f) of this Arbitration Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire Arbitration provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court. WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND CC AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW. If any other clause in this Arbitration Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Provision and the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be given full force and effect.  
  
i. Continuation. This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.  
  
j. Injunctive Relief.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you acknowledge that any threatened or actual breach of this ToU regarding CC's intellectual property or proprietary rights,  or other alleged infringement of a CC's intellectual property rights, may result in immediate, irreparable harm to CC for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and therefore CC may immediately seek equitable and/or injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (in addition to all other remedies available to CC at law or in equity).

12\. WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY  

===============================

The failure of CC to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the ToU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any of the provisions of the ToU are held invalid, unenforceable, or void by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the ToU remain in full force and effect. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

13\. ENTIRE AGREEMENT  

========================

These ToU constitute the entire and only Agreement between you and CC with respect to the Service, and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written, between you and CC. Any and all other collateral representations, promises, and conditions; and any representation, warranty, promise or condition not incorporated herein or made as provided for in these ToU shall not be binding on CC.

14\. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES  

====================================

You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these ToU, there shall be no third party beneficiaries to this agreement.

15\. SECTION TITLES  

======================

The section titles in the ToU are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

16\. ASSIGNMENT  

==================

These ToU, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned or transferred by CC without restriction.

17\. VIOLATIONS
