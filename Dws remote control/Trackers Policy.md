DWSNET s.r.l. (“from now on, for the sake of brevity, “DWService”, or the “Company”, or “we”) informs you that your personal data acquired while browsing DWService’s web site will be processed in accordance with the law on the protection of personal data.

With this statement (pursuant to Article 13 of EU Regulation No. 679/2016) DWService provides you with the information regarding the methods used for the management and processing of your personal data:

  

### 1\. Types of data collected, purposes, legal basis for the processing operations and period of data storage

#### 1.1. Cookies

What are cookies?

Cookies are small text strings that the sites you visit send to your computer (normally your browser), where they are stored and then re-transmitted back to the sites when you visit them again.

  

#### 1.2 Types of cookies used by this site

**Technical and analytical cookies with limited potential to identify you.**

Technical cookies are those used for the sole purpose of transmitting a communication on an electronic communications network or to the extent strictly necessary for the supplier of a company service, transmitting the information explicitly requested by the subscriber or the user with a view to providing said service.

Analytical cookies, on the other hand, are used to analyze and measure use of the website by users. Analytical cookies are similar to technical cookies when used directly by the site manager to collect information, in aggregate form, on the number of users to the site and on how they visit it.

The legal basis that legitimizes the processing of personal data for this purpose is set out in Article 122, co. 1 del D.lgs 196/2003, since the processing is necessary in order to provide you with the requested service.

  

**The technical and analytical cookies used by the site are:**

_Cookie name:_ **DWS\_SID**  
_Technical cookie:_ this cookie collects the session ID.  
_Type of data processed:_ Session ID.  
_Expiry of the cookie:_ Session cookie.  

_Cookie name:_ **DWS\_NDXXXXXX\_SLOTS**  
_Technical cookie:_ This cookie is used to identify free channels for file download/upload and for data stream.  
_Type of data processed:_ Alphanumeric id.  
_Expiry of the cookie:_ Session cookie.  

  

**Disabling cookies.**

All modern browsers make it possible for you to decide whether or not you want to block the installation of cookies on your computer or to cancel any that may already have been installed. This also applies to cookies installed following browsing on this site. In this case, failure/refusal to install cookies may render browsing the site difficult or even impossible.

The methods for deactivating the installation of cookies on the most modern browsers are shown below:

### 2\. Data retention period

Your personal data collected and processed once you have started browsing DWService’s web site will be stored for the entire period of service delivery and thereafter immediately deleted. Cookies installed via the site are temporary and are deleted automatically at the end of the session.

  

### 3\. Processing methods and security measures

Any personal data collected will be processed, retained and analyzed using electronic tools and will be stored both in electronic format and in hard copy, organized into databases, and on any other appropriate type of media.

Specific security measures are implemented to prevent the loss, illegal or unfair use of the data, or unauthorized access to them. The list of implemented security measures is available in the [Security](https://www.dwservice.net/security.html) section of the site.

The processing of your personal data carried out by DWService does not involve any automated decision-making.

  

### 4\. Disclosure of the personal data

The disclosure of the browsing data is required in order to supply the requested service (browsing of the site) and is, therefore, compulsory for that purpose: failure/refusal to provide your personal data shall make it impossible to allow you to browse DWService’s web site or App.

The installation of technical and analytical cookies from this site is optional (it can be blocked via the browser settings), but it could make the site, or some of its services, unusable.

  

### 5\. Parties to which your personal data may be disclosed

None of your personal data collected by the Company will be disclosed indiscriminately, but may be communicated to those parties that have the right to access your personal data to ensure compliance with legal and secondary and/or EU regulations (for example, to Authorities in the framework of judicial cooperation), and to the Data Controller’s own personnel, and also to companies, associations or professional firms that provide services and operations on behalf of the Data Controller, operating as Data Processors, in particular for the provision of ICT services (e.g. web hosting services), to ensure compliance with legal obligations, and for every other organisational and/or administrative requirement that is necessary to provide the requested services.

The names of the parties, operating as Data Processors, to which your personal data may be disclosed are shown in an up-to-date list that can be requested from DWService (through the contact information indicated at Point 9).

  

### 6\. Transfer of data outside the European Economic Area or to international organisations

DWService does not transfer personal data collected through its website outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or to international organizations. In exceptional cases, solely for the purpose of complying with legal obligations to which it is subject, DWService may transfer personal data to foreign Public Authorities (e.g. to United States of America Authorities). In these cases, the transfer of data outside the EEA will only take place in the presence of relevant reasons of public interest, as provided for in art. 49, par. 1, lett. d) Reg. EU n. 679/2016, and in compliance with the additional applicable data protection laws.

  

### 7\. Links to third-party websites or services.

This privacy notice is provided only for the processing of personal data carried out through DWService’s web site, and not for other websites that may be visited by the user via links, which act as independent data controllers. Therefore, users are invited to carefully read the privacy policies of third-party services before accessing them. All information regarding the processing of data by YouTube can be found in its [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

  

### 8\. Your rights as the Data Subject.

In relation to the aforementioned processing operations carried out on your personal data, you are entitled to exercise at all times those rights set out by EU Regulation No. 679/2016 (GDPR), including, for example, the right to be informed, within 30 days from your request, as to:

* the origin of any personal data held that concern you;
* the purposes and methods of the processing operations;

* the limitation of the processing of those data that concern you, or to request the reduction of the purposes and/or methods for/with which your data are being processed to the Data Controller or the Data Processor.

You can also request a copy of your data in a standard format (the so-called “Right to data portability”).

**As the Data Subject, you also have the right to object, at any time and at no cost, wholly or partially:**

* **for legitimate reasons, to processing of your personal data, even if the processing operations are still relevant to the purpose for which the data were collected in the first place;**
* **to processing of your personal data carried out pursuant to Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the GDPR, Letters e. (“processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller”) or f. (“processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party”) including profiling on the basis of these provisions;**
* **to processing of your personal data for the purposes of sending advertising or direct sales material or for the completion of market research or commercial communications (direct marketing), including any relevant profiling operations.**

You have the right to withdraw your consent for the processing operations when that consent is based on Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter a. (when “the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes”), or by Article 9, Paragraph 2, Letter a. (when “the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes”) of EU Regulation No. 679/2016, at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on the consent before its withdrawal.

In particular, the person to whom the data is referred, in order not to receive any more e-mails of a promotional nature, can at any time and free of charge request cancellation from the service by sending a message to the contact information indicated in Section 9 of this policy.

Should you consider the processing operations to have been carried out in breach of current legislation, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, specifically in the Member State in which you habitually reside or work, or the Member State where the alleged breach has taken place. The Italian supervisory authority can be contacted using the contact data on its [own website](https://www.garanteprivacy.it/).
