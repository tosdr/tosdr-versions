Privacy policy
==============

For maximum transparency, we list what data we collect from you and how we use it. The protection of your data is important to us and it should be to you too. **Please read this statement carefully; it is in your interest.**

Responsible persons and contact persons
=======================================

MetaGer and related services are operated by [SUMA-EV](https://suma-ev.de/), which is also the author of this statement. In this statement, “we” generally means SUMA-EV. You can find our contact details in our [Imprint](https://metager.org/impressum). We can be reached by email using our [contact form](https://metager.org/kontakt).

Principles
==========

As a non-profit association, we are committed to free access to knowledge. Since we know that free research is not compatible with mass surveillance, we also take data protection very seriously. We have always only processed the data that is absolutely necessary for the operation of our services. Data protection is always our standard. We do not operate profiling – i.e. the automatic creation of user profiles.

Incoming data by context
========================

1. Use of the web search engine MetaGer
    ====================================
    
    When using our web search engine MetaGer via its web form or through its OpenSearch interface, the following data is generated:

    2. [User-Agent:](#user-agent) Will not be saved or shared.
    3. [Search Query:](#search-request) As an integral part of metasearch, the search query is transmitted to our partners to obtain search results for display on the results page. The results received, including the search term, are kept for display for a few hours.
    4. [User Preferences:](#preferences) We use this data (e.g. language settings) to answer the respective search query. We store some of this data on a non-personal basis for statistical purposes.
    
    ### The following data is also collected if you use our ad-supported version:
    
    1. [IP-Address](#ip-address), [User-Agent](#user-agent):
        
        To protect our service from overload, we need to limit the number of searches per internet connection. For this purpose alone, we store the full IP address and a timestamp for a maximum of 96 hours. If a noticeably large number of searches are carried out from an IP, this IP is temporarily (maximum 96 hours after the last search) saved in a blacklist. The IP is then deleted.
        
    2. [Microsoft Clarity & Yahoo](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement)
        
        We work with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising to bring you free Yahoo search results and advertising. For this purpose, usage data for statistical purposes including your IP address is recorded on the MetaGer results page.

Description of resulting data
=============================

1. Internet protocol address
    -------------------------
    
    The Internet protocol address (hereinafter referred to as IP) is mandatory in order to use web services such as MetaGer. This IP, in combination with a date – similar to a telephone number – clearly identifies an Internet access and its owner. In general, the first three (of a total of four) blocks of an IP are not personal. If rear blocks of the IP are shortened, the shortened address identifies the approximate geographical area around the Internet connection.
    
    ### Examples (full IP address)
    
    154.67.88.47  
    82.159.53.49
    
    ### Examples (first two blocks only)
    
    154.67.0.0  
    82.159.0.0
    
2. User agent identifier
    ---------------------
    
    When you call up a website, your browser automatically sends an identifier, usually with data about the browser and operating system used. This browser identifier (the so-called user agent) can be used by websites, for example, to recognize mobile devices and present them with a customized output.
    
    ### Example
    
    Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86\_64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0
    
3. Payment Details
    ---------------
    
    When purchasing a MetaGer key, different payment data are required depending on the payment provider
    
    ### Examples

    IBAN: DE1234567890123  
    Last digits of the credit card number: XXXXXXXXXXX1234  
    
4. Entered search query
    --------------------
    
    Search terms entered are absolutely necessary for a web search. As a rule, no personal data can be obtained from them; among other things, because they do not have a fixed structure.
    
    ### Examples
    
    water consumption shower  
    Lyrics On a tree a cuckoo  
    
5. User Preferences
    ----------------
    
    In addition to form data and user agents, the browser often transfers other data. This includes language selection, search settings, accept headers, do not track headers and more.
    
    ### Examples
    
    interface=de sprachfilter=all fokus=web  
    interface=de sprachfilter=de fokus=nachrichten  
    interface=en sprachfilter=en fokus=web
