9.2 We may provide you with free access to our products and services for a limited period of time on a trial basis. We may require you to provide us with a valid payment method in order to provide you with such free trial access. It is your responsibility to cancel your subscription before the end of any trial period, otherwise your payment method will automatically be charged for a standard subscription to the same products and services for which you have had free access during the trial period. You will not be entitled to any refunds for any payments taken from your payment method following the end of any free trial access period.

9.3 For so long as your account and subscription remain active in accordance with these terms and conditions, you will benefit from the features specified on our website in relation to your subscription type.

9.4 We may from time to time vary the benefits associated with a subscription by giving you written notice of the variation, providing that, if in our reasonable opinion such a variation results in a substantial loss of value or functionality, you shall have the right to cancel your subscription, and we will refund to you any amounts paid to us in respect of any period of subscription after the date of such cancellation.

**10.** **Fees**
----------------

10.1  The fees in respect of our products and services will be as set out on the website from time to time.

10.2  All amounts stated in these terms and conditions or on our website are stated inclusive of VAT.

10.3  You must pay to us the fees in respect of our website services in advance, in full, in cleared funds, in accordance with any instructions on our website.

10.4  We may vary fees from time to time by posting new fees on our website, but this will not affect fees for services that have been previously paid.

10.5  If you dispute any payment made to us, you must contact us immediately and provide full details of your claim.

10.6  If you make an unjustified credit card, debit card or other charge-back then you will be liable to pay us, within 7 days following the date of our written request:

(a) an amount equal to the amount of the charge-back;

(b) all third party expenses incurred by us in relation to the charge-back (including charges made by our or your bank or payment processor or card issuer);

(c) an administration fee of GBP 15.00 including VAT; and

(d) all our reasonable costs, losses and expenses incurred in recovering the amounts referred to in this Section 10.6 (including without limitation legal fees and debt collection fees),

    and for the avoidance of doubt, if you fail to recognise or fail to remember the source of an entry on your card statement or other financial statement, and make a charge-back as a result, this will constitute an unjustified charge-back for the purposes of this Section 10.6.

10.7  If you owe us any amount under or relating to these terms and conditions, we may suspend or withdraw the provision of services to you.

10.8  We may at any time set off any amount that you owe to us against any amount that we owe to you, by sending you written notice of the set-off.

    subject to Section 11.3. You do not have to give any reason for your withdrawal or cancellation.

11.3  You agree that we may begin the provision of services before the expiry of the period referred to in Section 11.2, and you acknowledge that, if we do begin the provision of services before the end of that period, then:

(a) if the services are fully performed, you will lose the right to cancel referred to in Section 11.2;

(b) if the services are partially performed at the time of cancellation, you must pay to us an amount proportional to the services supplied or we may deduct such amount from any refund due to you in accordance with this Section 11.

11.4  In order to withdraw an offer to contract or cancel a contract on the basis described in this Section 11, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw or cancel (as the case may be). You may inform us by means of any clear statement setting out the decision. In the case of cancellation, you may inform us using the cancellation form that we will make available to you. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning the exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired.

11.5  If you withdraw an offer to contract, or cancel a contract, on the basis described in this Section 11, you will receive a full refund of any amount you paid to us in respect of the offer or contract, except as specified in this Section 11.
