When we say “our”, “us”, “we” or “Fandango” in these Terms of Use (these “Terms”), we mean Fandango Media, LLC or its subsidiaries. These Terms apply to websites and applications operating under the Fandango, Fandango at Home, Vudu, M-GO, Rotten Tomatoes, Flixster, Movieclips, Movies.com, Activaterewards.com or MovieTickets.com brands or other brands that we own, as well as to our websites, applications, emails or other communications that link to or reference any terms or policies that are a part of the [Fandango Terms and Policies](https://www.fandango.com/policies/terms-and-policies) (the **Terms and Policies**), or the other services provided through any of these means (all of the foregoing collectively, the **Services** or **Site**). These Terms are subject to, and shall also include, the other [Terms and Policies](https://www.fandango.com/policies/terms-and-policies).

    If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or otherwise use the Services.
    
* Modifications: Fandango may modify these Terms, and such changes will be effective, and will be deemed accepted by you, the earlier of your next access or use of the Services after we have made such changes or 30 days following the earlier of either notification to you or our posting of the changes to the Services.

##### 4\. DEVICES, CHARGES, MOBILE TERMS

* ##### SMS TEXT AND CALLS TO YOUR MOBILE PHONE
    
    **If you elect to provide us with your mobile telephone number, in so doing you agree that we may call or text you at that number, in which case your carrier may charge you their text, data, voice, phone and other rates. When we contact you via phone or text at that number, we may do so using automated technology. If you elect to receive marketing texts at that number, you will be provided with instructions as to how to opt out of further texts of the type that you had elected to receive. You may also [Contact Us](https://www.fandango.com/ContactUs.aspx).**
    
    By subscribing to text messages, you consent to receiving, from time to time, text messages from us, which may include movie alerts, promotions, polls, and giveaways. Message frequency varies based on user and other factors. Message and data and other rates may apply and, if so, are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator.

Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS service may include your mobile phone number, your carrier's name and the date, time and content of your messages. We may use this information to contact you and to provide the services you request from us and for other business purposes. In providing a phone number to us, you are representing that you are the primary owner of that phone number and that the information provided to us is accurate.
    
* ##### FANDANGO MOBILE TICKETS
    
    Rather than bringing a Print-at-Home Bar-Coded Ticket or confirmation number to the theater, some of the theaters ticketing through Fandango give you the option of having your ticket delivered to your mobile device as a picture message (a "Mobile Ticket"). The Mobile Ticket contains a unique barcode and some accompanying text with details of the movie you are going to see. If you have questions about the purchase or use of the Mobile Ticket, please [Contact Us](https://www.fandango.com/ContactUs.aspx). Please note that Mobile Tickets are not available for MovieTickets.com mobile applications.
    
    Your purchase of a Mobile Ticket will be deemed your agreement to the following terms:
    
    * Message and data and other rates may apply and, if so, are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider.
    * The Mobile Ticket is in the form of a unique barcode sent as a text message to your mobile device or delivered on the purchase confirmation page in the Fandango mobile app. The barcode and any accompanying text sent to you by Fandango is the entire ticket, and not the barcode in isolation from the accompanying text. Accompanying text includes any text stating the originating source of the barcode. Any barcode with non-original text is invalid.
    * The Mobile Ticket barcode cannot be forwarded to anyone else. Doing so invalidates your Mobile Ticket without the right to a refund.
    * If you purchase multiple tickets in a single order, your Mobile Ticket holds all of those tickets, and all of your guests must arrive at the same time to gain entry using your Mobile Ticket.
    * Fandango is not responsible for lost or stolen Mobile Tickets, except as required by law. Anyone attempting to gain entry with a Mobile Ticket reported lost or stolen, or cancelled for any other reason, may be reported to the authorities and may have their mobile device withheld as evidence.
    * Fandango shall have the right to void any Mobile Tickets that violate these policies.
* ##### GOOGLE MAPS
    
    If you use Google Maps / Google Earth as part of the Services, you agree to comply with the [Google Maps / Google Earth Additional Terms of Service](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html) (including the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)). Further, you agree that Google, and not Fandango, shall be responsible for any of your information Google receives as a result of your use of Google Maps / Google Earth.
    
* ##### DEVICES AND CHARGES GENERALLY
    
    You are solely responsible for obtaining all devices and software, internet connectivity, mobile service, and other services needed for your use of the Services, and you will be solely responsible for all charges related to them. Your carrier or internet service provider may charge fees for or restrict certain.

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. Section 512 as amended by Title II of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, we reserve the right to remove your User Materials.

##### 9\. COPYRIGHTS

* Fandango respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "Act") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Fandango, pursuant to the Act, reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate your license to use the Services if it determines in its sole and absolute discretion that you are involved in infringing activity, including alleged acts of first-time or repeat infringement, regardless of whether the material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing. Therefore, in compliance with the Act, if you believe that any such third party materials infringe your intellectual property rights, please send a notice to the agent identified below to request a review of the alleged infringement. The notice must include the following information (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Fandango to locate the material on the Services; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Fandango a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see [http://www.loc.gov/copyright](http://www.loc.gov/copyright) for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services should be sent to:
    
    NBCUniversal  
    Attn: DMCA Agent  
    100 Universal City Plaza, LRW 6  
    Universal City, CA 91608  
    Phone: 818-777-1000  
      
    by email: [dmca.agent@nbcuni.com](mailto:dmca.agent@nbcuni.com)
    
    Fandango suggests that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, please be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
