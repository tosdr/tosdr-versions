What is a cookie?
-----------------

A cookie is a text file that the website you are visiting asks to save on your computer (including smartphones and tablets). Cookies are used to provide the visitor access to a variety of features and makes it possible to identify the visitor.

There are two types of cookies. One stores a file during a longer time on your computer with a predetermined expiration date. These types of cookies are typically used for features that tell you what is new since you last visited the website. When the expiration date has passed, the cookie is automatically deleted from your computer when you revisit the website that set it.

The other type has a shorter duration (a so called session cookie) and does not have an expiration date. It is stored temporarily during the time that you visit a website. This type of cookie is often used to keep track of the language that you have chosen and disappears when you close your browser window.
