Setapp is a service you subscribe to that lets you download apps on your macOS, iPadOS, or iOS devices. But remember, the apps you can get might change based on where you live. For instance, if you're in the EU, you can directly download apps on iOS devices.

_\*Please note that Setapp’s functionality and apps availability may differ depending on your region. For example, only users in the EU can download apps directly on iOS devices._

In this Privacy Policy, We explain why We collect the information framed herein, what We do with that information, and how We handle that information. We’ll also explain what choices You have with respect to the information.

If you don't want the emails anymore, there's a link in every email where you can say "no more emails, please!" or you can tell us directly.

Data Retention
--------------

Where we act as the controller of the data, such as where we use personal information for MacPaw’s own independent purpose of the activity, we will retain your information for the necessary period of time that it serves the purpose for which it was originally processed or subsequently authorised and in accordance with applicable law. Namely, but not exclusively, we retain Your data to maintain and expand our relationship and provide you with our services and offerings; in order to comply with our legal and contractual obligations; or to protect ourselves from any potential disputes (i.e. as required by laws applicable to log-keeping, records and bookkeeping, and in order to have proof and evidence concerning our relationship, should any legal issues arise following your discontinuance of use), all in accordance with our internal policies and applicable laws.

Sometimes we, at MacPaw, need to keep some of your personal information. We only keep it for as long as we need it. We might need to keep it to help us offer you our services, to do what the law says, or to keep things safe and fair.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and the applicable legal requirements.

We think about what info we have, what it's about, how sensitive it is, if there's any risk of it being used wrongly, why we need it, and what the law says to decide how long we keep it.

We delete, block or anonymize the personal data of the data subject as soon as the purpose of the storage is fulfilled.

Once we don't need it anymore, we make sure to delete it, or make it so nobody knows it was about you.

Data Storage And Transfers
--------------------------

We use data centers that store Setapp, Services, Site and databases, IT service providers that maintain our systems, and consulting companies. Therefore, for the date of acceptance of the Terms of Use and acknowledgment of this Privacy Policy by You, the information submitted to MacPaw can be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States of America, the countries of the European Union and Ukraine. Data stored and processed by MacPaw may sometimes be moved between these zones (in a secure manner). If you post or transfer any information to or through our Product, you are agreeing to such information, including Personal Data, being hosted and accessed in the United States of America; the countries of the European Union and Ukraine.

We use special computer storages to keep Setapp, our services, our website, and databases. These storages can be in places like America, Europe, and Ukraine. We might need to move some info between these places, but it's always done safely. When you use our stuff, you're okay with us storing and accessing your info in these places.

MacPaw may use services of other providers that are partly located in third countries (outside the European Union or the European Economic Area). Where this is the case, and there is no adequacy decision for these countries, MacPaw undertakes to take appropriate precautions to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any data transfers. These include, among others, the standard contractual clauses in force at the time of transfer of data, or binding internal data protection regulations.

Sometimes, we use services from other companies outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area. When we do, we ensure there's enough protection for any info that moves.

If a third country transfer is provided for and no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards are in place, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the respective third country (e.g. intelligence services) may gain access to the transferred data in order to collect and analyze it, and that enforceability of your data subject rights cannot be guaranteed.

But, in some cases, authorities from these places might be able to look at the info, and we can't always guarantee they won't.

However, we will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of personal data is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests. Data transfers to service providers and other third parties are protected by contractual obligations and, where appropriate, by other guarantees, such as standard contractual terms issued by the European Commission or certification schemes.

Don't worry, we always manage any movement of your info carefully to protect your rights. We protect these transfers with contracts, and if needed, other safeguards like standard contractual terms by the European Commission or certificates.

Data Disclosures
----------------

We disclose personal data in the following ways:

#### Developers

We may transfer our email addresses to Developers only after receiving your consent for such a transfer. In all other situations, we do not disclose Your personal information to Developers. For example, you can log in to Developers’ websites with your Setapp account. Developers will receive your personal data only when you have consented to sharing your personal data with them, i.e., authorise them to access your data at Setapp.

We might share your email address with developers if you say it's okay. Besides that, we don't share your personal info with them. For example, when you log into a developer's website with your Setapp account, they'll only get your details if you've said they can.

#### Service Providers

We engage selected third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf or complementary to our own. Such service providers include hosting and server co-location services, data security services, contract, billing and payment processing services, fraud detection and prevention services, web and product analytics, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, session or activity recording services, remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, social and advertising networks, hosting services, e-mail, voicemails, support, enablement and customer relation management systems, and our legal, financial and compliance advisors (collectively, **“Service Providers“**). Our Service Providers may have access to personal information, depending on each of their specific roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services, and may only use the data as determined in our agreements with them.

We work with certain trusted companies and individuals to help us out or add to what we do. These helpers might need to look at your personal info depending on their job in helping and improving our services, but they only use it the way we have agreed.Right now, our helpers include companies that handle things like data storage, keeping data secure, billing, payments, spotting fraud, analysing how our services are used, recording sessions, remote access, measuring performance, optimizing data, marketing, ads, managing emails, voicemails, customer support, legal, financial and compliance advice and more.

Also, if MacPaw or any of our companies changes hands or goes through big changes, like merging with another company, we might share or move your personal info to the parties involved. This could also happen if the company becomes insolvent, bankrupt, or taken over.

For the avoidance of doubt, MacPaw may share personal data in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal, non-identifiable and anonymous. We may transfer, share or otherwise use non-personal and non-identifiable data at our sole discretion and without the need for further approval.

Just to be clear, we might share your personal info in other ways, if you say it's okay, if the law says we have to, or if we've made it impossible to tell who the info is about. We can transfer, share, or use info that doesn't identify anyone without needing further approval.

Safeguards
----------

When You give Us personal data, We take steps to make sure that it’s treated securely.

When you give us your personal information, we work hard to keep it safe.

Non-sensitive details (Your email address etc.) are sent normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while We strive to protect personal data, We cannot guarantee the security of any personal data users transmit to Us, and You do so at Your own risk. Once We receive personal data, We make Our best effort to ensure its security on Our systems.

Simple things like your email address are sent over the internet, but we can't guarantee it's completely secure. So, while we try our best to protect your information, there's still a risk when you send it to us.

We use industry-standard encryption to protect personal data in transit. This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.

We use fancy encryption technology to keep your information safe when it's moving around online.

Once We receive personal data, We protect it on Our servers using a combination of technical, physical, and logical security safeguards.

Once we have your information, we use a bunch of security measures to keep it safe on our computers.

The MacPaw takes the security of Your personal data very seriously and works to protect Your personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorised access or disclosure.

We take protecting your personal information seriously and do everything we can to keep it safe from getting lost, used the wrong way, or seen by people who shouldn't.
