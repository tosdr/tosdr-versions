#### Acceptance of the Terms and Conditions

These Terms and Conditions set forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the various websites owned and operated by Touch of Modern, LLC d/b/a Touch of Modern (“Touch of Modern,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) of including, without limitation, the touchofmodern.com website (the "Website"), the mobile application offered by Touch of Modern (the "App"), your purchase of the products sold through our Website and App (the "Products"), but not your use of such Products, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Touch of Modern in connection with the above (collectively, the "Service").

Please read the Terms and Conditions carefully before you start to use the Service. By using the Service, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy, found at https://www.touchofmodern.com/privacy, incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms and Conditions or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Website or the App.

#### Eligibility

This Service is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. By using this Service, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Service.

#### Terms of Sale

**Prices and Payment Terms**

We display discounts on our Website or the App in connection with each Product. Discounts are calculated using pricing information provided to us by merchants (such as suggested retail prices from the manufacturer, supplier, or the merchant, or an estimated price based on standard industry practice).

We strive to display accurate price information, however we may, on occasion, make inadvertent typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions related to pricing and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions at any time and to cancel any orders arising from such occurrences. If you do not wish to continue with your order after pricing or other information has been corrected, please contact us right away and we will work with you to cancel or return your order.

**Shipments; Delivery**

You shall pay for all shipping and handling charges specified during the ordering process. Shipping and handling charges are reimbursement for the costs we incur in the processing, handling, packing, shipping, and delivery of your order. These may differ from the amounts we actually incur from any carrier. We are not liable for any delays in shipments.

**Returns and Refunds**

Unless otherwise required by law, Touch of Modern accepts returns on certain Products on a case-by- case basis. If, however, a Product is listed as final sale, we will not accept returns for such Product, unless it is defective. If a Product offered by Touch of Modern is defective, please send an email to [support@touchofmodern.com](mailto:support@touchofmodern.com) within 48 hours of receiving the Product, unless a longer time is required by law. We will either replace the defective product or issue a full refund. For more information on our Return Policy and how we handle Returns, please check our [FAQs](https://support.touchofmodern.com/hc/en-us).

You are responsible for all shipping and handling charges on returned items unless otherwise specified. You bear the risk of loss during shipment. We therefore strongly recommend that you fully insure your return shipment against loss or damage and that you use a carrier that can provide you with proof of delivery for your protection.

Refunds or exchanges for returns will be processed when the item has been received in our warehouse. Upon return, your item will be inspected, and exchanges, credits or refunds will be issued for the purchase price. Please allow up to 2 to 3 weeks for your refund or exchange to process.

Refunds can be issued in the form of a gift card or processed back to the original method of payment. Original payments made by cash or check are refunded by company check from our corporate office within 2 to 3 weeks of the item being received in our warehouse.

WE OFFER NO REFUNDS ON ANY PRODUCTS DESIGNATED ON THIS WEBSITE AS NON-RETURNABLE OR FINAL SALE.

For defective returns, please refer to the manufacturer's warranty included with the product or as detailed in the Product's description.

**Special Offers**

Occasionally we will offer special promotions. This can include a gift with purchase, free shipping, manufacturer offers, or other promotional activity associated with a product purchase. These offers may be for a limited time only. If there is a conflict between the terms for a promotion and these Terms and Conditions, the promotion terms will govern.

**Goods Not for Resale or Export**

You represent and warrant that you are buying Products or services from the Service for your own personal or household use only, and not for resale or export. You further represent and warrant that all purchases are intended for final delivery to locations within the United States of America and to Canada.

#### Text Messaging Terms and Conditions

To the extent that we offer various text messaging services (“SMS Service”), and if you sign up or agree to participate in any such services, these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy apply to such programs.

**Signing Up and Opting-In to the SMS Service**

Enrollment in the SMS Service requires you to provide your mobile phone number. Please only provide your own mobile phone number. You may not enroll if you are under 18 years old. Before the SMS Service will start, you will need to verify the mobile phone number you provided by responding to a text message to your mobile phone that affirms your choice to opt-in to the SMS Service and your agreement to these Terms and Conditions. Note that in affirming this message, you acknowledge that notices about your order will be sent to the number you provide and whoever has access to that mobile phone or the carrier account may be able to see this information.

Text messages may include cart abandon messages. Message frequency varies. This service is optional and is not a condition for purchase. You can opt out of receiving any further messages from us at any time (see details below). For help, reply HELP to any text message you receive from us or email textsupport@wunderkind.co.

Text message services are provided on an “AS IS” basis. Data obtained from you in connection with any text message services may include your mobile phone number, your provider’s name and the date, time and content of your text messages. We may use this information in accordance with our Privacy Policy to contact you and to provide the services you request from us. For more information on how we use telephone numbers, please read our Privacy Policy.

**Message and Data Rates May Apply**

In addition to any fee of which you are notified, your mobile provider’s message and data rates may apply to our confirmation text message and all subsequent text message correspondence according to your individual rate plan provided by your wireless carrier (e.g., T-Mobile, AT&T, etc.). Please consult your service agreement with your wireless carrier or contact your wireless carrier to determine your phone’s pricing plan and the charges for sending and receiving text messages. You acknowledge that you are responsible for any message, data or other charges incurred (usage, subscription, etc.) as a result of using the SMS Service. Under no circumstances will we or our affiliates be responsible for any text messaging or wireless charges incurred by you or by a person who has access to your wireless device or telephone number.

The SMS Service may not be available on all wireless carriers. If your wireless carrier does not permit text messages, you may not receive the text messages. The Company may add or remove any wireless carrier from the SMS Service at any time without notice. Customers may opt out of the SMS Service at any time (see details below). Neither the Company nor the wireless carriers will be responsible for any undue delays or errors in messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. We do our best to be accurate and to process the orders on time.

**To Stop the SMS Service**

To stop receiving text messages from the Company at any time, you can opt out of the Service via text message. To stop receiving text messages from the Company, text the word STOP in a reply text message to any of the text messages you have received from the Company. In response, you will receive a one-time opt out confirmation text message. After that, you will receive no more text messages from the Company.

**Mobile Phone Number Change**

In the event that you change or deactivate the mobile phone number you have provided, you have an affirmative obligation to update your account information and the phone number(s) attached to your account by texting START to resubscribe to prevent us from inadvertently communicating with anyone who acquires any phone number(s) previously attributed to you. Any new phone number(s) you attach to your account may receive our standard marketing text messages unless you also opt out via the procedure detailed above.

#### Termination

We reserve the right to not provide the Service to any person. We also reserve the right to terminate any user’s right to access the Service at any time, in our discretion. If you violate any of these Terms and Conditions, your permission to use the Website and services automatically terminates.

#### Disclaimer of Warranties

You understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the internet or the Service will be free of viruses or other destructive code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our Website for any reconstruction of any lost data. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY A DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACK, VIRUSES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGICALLY HARMFUL MATERIAL THAT MAY INFECT YOUR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, DATA OR OTHER PROPRIETARY MATERIAL DUE TO YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR TO YOUR DOWNLOADING OF ANY MATERIAL POSTED ON IT, OR ON ANY WEBSITE LINKED TO IT.

YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, ITS CONTENT AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR APP IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE WEBSITE, ITS CONTENT AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR APP ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPLETENESS, SECURITY, RELIABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY OR AVAILABILITY OF THE WEBSITE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY REPRESENTS OR WARRANTS THAT THE WEBSITE, ITS CONTENT OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR APP WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT OUR SERVICE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS OR THAT THE WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR APP WILL OTHERWISE MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND THOSE ARISING OUT OF A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

#### Limitation on Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE WEBSITE, THE APP, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE WEBSITE, APP, OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES OR APPS OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR APP OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER THESE TERMS, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, WILL BE LIMITED TO AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID US DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

You understand and agree that we have set our prices and entered into these Terms and Conditions with you in reliance upon the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms and Conditions, which allocate risk between us and form the basis of a bargain between the parties.

#### Indemnification

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, licensors and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, proceedings, demands, losses, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal costs) of any kind or nature, arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms and Conditions or your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Website's content, App’s content, services and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms and Conditions , or your use of any information obtained from the Service. If we assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with us in such defense.

#### Arbitration

Except as set forth below, you and we agree that we will resolve all existing, whether asserted or unasserted, and future disputes between us (including any such disputes between you and a third-party agent of ours, and any disputes that arose prior to your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions) through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim (defined below). All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and us or you and a third party agent of ours (each a “Claim”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards (the “JAMS Standards”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator, and not a court, shall determine any question of arbitrability of any claim and any question involving the scope of any arbitration. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration, by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies, or as specifically permitted by state law. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. However, the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including, but not limited to, a claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.

If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

This arbitration agreement does not preclude either party from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and we also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms and Conditions, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms and Conditions.

Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief available under applicable law subject to any applicable limitation of liability, including injunctive and declaratory relief, as if the action were brought in court on an individual basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or herein, the arbitrator may not issue a “public injunction” and any such “public injunction” may be awarded only by a federal or state court, which that party shall be permitted to pursue in the appropriate court. If either party seeks a “public injunction,” all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim for a “public injunction” in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party’s claim or prayer for “public injunctive relief.” Including a claim for “public injunctive relief” in any complaint shall not deprive the arbitrator of any right to hear and adjudicate all other claims in arbitration. In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.

If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms and Conditions will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms and Conditions. This Section of the Terms and Conditions will survive the termination of your relationship with us.

THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE JAMS STANDARDS, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

#### Other Provisions

Under no circumstances will we be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.

These Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.

You agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms, the Site, or Services, not subject to the arbitration provision above, will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Indiana. You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.

If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and Conditions and will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions.

The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.
