An ideal stool looks like a torpedo â€“ it should be large, soft, fluffy and easy to pass.

â€“ _**Dr. Foxx-Orenstein**, president of the American College of Gastroenterology_

There is nothing more natural than pooing. Everyone does it, sometimes several times a day. It doesn't matter if you are young or old, rich or poor, a queen or the president... Even the Pope needs to take a poo. Please visit often to analyze your poo.

Please understand that this program has been designed to help you evaluate and manage your daily diet and routines. It is in no way a replacement for medical consultation. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned about the color, shape, or behavior of your bowel movements.
