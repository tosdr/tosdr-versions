### Introduction

When you use StoolAnalyzer.com, you trust us with your information. This Privacy policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully.

### What personal information we may collect

When you register as an StoolAnalyzer.com member or contact us, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences.

We may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances for the purpose of identity authentication.

### How we use your personal information

The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on StoolAnalyzer.com latest changes of terms and policies, website updates, and communicating with customers.

We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our content, services, and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.

We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of StoolAnalyzer.com account holders.

From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with StoolAnalyzer.com, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.

We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve StoolAnalyzer.com's products, services, and customer communications.

If you enter into a sweepstakes, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.

### Collection and use of non-personal information

We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:

* We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an StoolAnalyzer.com product is used so that we can better understand customer behaviour and improve our products, services, and advertising.
* We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website and services are of most interest.

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the StoolAnalyzer.com website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.

An ideal stool looks like a torpedo – it should be large, soft, fluffy and easy to pass.

– _**Dr. Foxx-Orenstein**, president of the American College of Gastroenterology_

There is nothing more natural than pooing. Everyone does it, sometimes several times a day. It doesn't matter if you are young or old, rich or poor, a queen or the president... Even the Pope needs to take a poo. Please visit often to analyze your poo.

Please understand that this program has been designed to help you evaluate and manage your daily diet and routines. It is in no way a replacement for medical consultation. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned about the color, shape, or behavior of your bowel movements.
