If the issue has not been resolved to your satisfaction after you have contacted the applicable Vendor, you may contact CFI at [\[email protected\]](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) within seven (7) days after the date on which you first contacted the Vendor with your issue.

The Website may contain technologies that restrict or limit the use of the Website (including restrictions based on time or location).
