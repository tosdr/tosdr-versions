Cookies and other technologies

When you view the website, we collect and store some information on your computer. This information will be stored in a 'Cookie,' which is a file created on your computer’s hard drive, and will help us in many ways. For example, Cookies allow us to tailor the website to better match your interests and preferences. With most Internet browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block the creation of Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored, although doing so may affect your use of the website and your ability to access certain features of the website. Please refer to your browser instructions or the help section of your browser to learn more about these functions. The website may use Web beacon, gif or other technologies. When you access certain of our web pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us. These technologies usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you turn off cookies, Web beacon technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.
