**Cookie Policy:**
==================

Last Update: 29 March 2023

**What are cookies?**
---------------------

Cookies are very small text files that are placed on your device when you visit some websites, applications, or other web-based services (for ease we are going to call them "**Sites**") to help identify a computer, browser, or device.

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (for ease we are going to call them all, both ours and from third-party providers, "**Cookies**") to allow our services to function; maintain your preferences and settings; provide enhanced features; analyze how users use our services; combat fraud; prevent violations of our terms and policies; and to provide you with targeted advertising based on your interests.

Cookies also last for different lengths of time depending on the job they do. For instance, Session Cookies only last for your online session and disappear from your device upon termination of the browsing session. Persistent Cookies stay on your device after the browser has been closed and last for the period of time specified in the Cookie.

You can always choose to remove Cookies already stored on your device, but this might temporarily prevent you from using parts of our Sites.

For further info on the Cookies we use and how they work to enhance your experience with our Sites, please read on below:

**Cookies we use:**
-------------------

**1\. Necessary Cookies**

These Cookies are necessary for the Site to provide core functions and cannot be turned off in our systems.

These core functions usually include the main services on our Site, keeping the Site secure, managing your privacy settings, and allowing you to sign in or fill in forms.

These Cookies may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we use on our Sites.

You can set your browser to block or alert you about these Cookies, but some parts of the Site may look odd or might not work at all.

Please note that these Cookies do not collect or store any information that will directly identify you (such as your name, email address or address).

**2\. Performance Cookies**

These Cookies are primarily used for analytics in optimizing the Site's performance.

These Cookies allow us to count visits and behaviors on our Site so we can measure and improve the performance of our Site. They help us to know which pages on our Site are visited the most, which pages are not visited very often, and how visitors move around our Site. This helps us learn what kind of content and site experience visitors enjoy and prefer.

These Cookies may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we use on our Site.

If you don't allow these Cookies, we won't be able to recognize Site activity and will not be able to evaluate our Site performance.

Please note these Cookies do not collect or store any information that will directly identify you (such as your name, email address or address) and the information that is collected is used in aggregate.

**3\. Functional Cookies**

These Cookies enable enhanced Site features and allow the Site to provide deeper levels of functionality and personalization such as feature enhancement, spoiler prevention, and live chats.

These Cookies may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we use on our Site.

If you decide not to allow these Cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.

**4\. Advertising Cookies**

These Cookies help improve communications through advertising and social media, allowing us to accurately and properly:

* Pay for ads placed on our behalf (e.g., an ad that led you to purchase or download one of our games)
    
* Get paid when you see an ad on our Sites or third-party services
    
* Prevent you from repeatedly seeing the same ads
    
* Display targeted ads or other content on your computer or device (such as on our Sites or social networking services you are visiting or an app you are using) that may be of particular interest to you.
    

These Cookies may be set through our Site by our advertising partners. They also may be used by those partners to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant ads on our Sites or other third-party sites based on topics you may like.

If you do not allow these Cookies, you will still receive ads, but they will be less targeted to your device and/or your interests.

Please note these Cookies do not collect or store any information that will directly identify you (such as your name, email address or address).

**Managing Your Cookies:**
--------------------------

**In the Preference Tool**

We read or write Cookies for the preference level you set in the Cookie Preference Tool section of the Site you are visiting.

Please note that Cookies set though the Cookie Preference Tool before you changed your preferences will still be on your device, but we will honor your current choice for that Site when we read your updated preferences. You can however delete Cookies by using your browser settings.

**In Your Browser**

Most browsers will allow you to select your privacy settings. You can block Cookies, accept all Cookies, or pick a setting somewhere in-between. This range lets you control your Cookie settings, so you can:

* See what Cookies you've got and delete them on an individual basis
    
* Block third-party Cookies
    
* Block Cookies from particular Sites
    
* Block all Cookies from being set
    
* Delete all Cookies when you close your browser
    

Deleting Cookies means that any preference settings you have made on a Site will be lost. If you've set your preferences to opt out of Cookies, this setting will be lost too, as that information is stored in a Cookie. Blocking all Cookies means functionality on our Sites will be lost or limited, as described above. We don't recommend turning all Cookies off when using our Sites.

If you want to reduce your Cookie settings at any time --- for example, if you accept all Cookies, but later decide you don't want a certain type of cookie --- you'll need to use your browser settings to manage or remove any Cookies dropped on your previous visit.
