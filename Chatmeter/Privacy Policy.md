Privacy Policy
==============

#### This privacy policy was revised February 2022

Chatmeter, Inc (and our affiliates) know that you care about how the information we receive from you is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes Chatmeter’s privacy practices in relation to information that we collect through websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Domains”), through the software applications made available by us both online and mobile (the “Apps”), through our social media pages and apps located at:

[https://twitter.com/chatmeter](https://twitter.com/chatmeter)[https://www.linkedin.com/company/chatmeter](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chatmeter)[](https://plus.google.com/100440219709534292283)[https://www.facebook.com/thechatmeter/](https://www.facebook.com/thechatmeter/)[https://www.instagram.com/chatmeter/](https://www.instagram.com/chatmeter/)

(collectively, the “Social Media Pages”), and other services provided by us both online and offline; as well as through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Domains, the Apps and the Social Media Pages, the “Sites”). “You” or a “user” refers to any individual who visits or otherwise uses the Sites. By using the Sites, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.  
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Chatmeter does not own or control, or to individuals that Chatmeter does not employ or manage.

This Privacy Policy also does not apply to information that we receive or handle on behalf of our customers in our role as a service provider, such as information that we receive through the Chatmeter Platform or other Chatmeter services, including any apps we make available for use by services subscribers (collectively, the “Services”). Such information is governed by the terms of the applicable services agreement, rather than this Privacy Policy.

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

* Personal Information. “Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including: name, title, company name, job function, expertise, postal address, telephone number, or email address. If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Sites, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
* IP Address: An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access the Sites, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that you visited. Chatmeter uses IP Addresses to calculate usage levels of the Sites, help diagnose problems with its servers, administer the Sites, and monitoring the regions from which you navigate to Chatmeter Sites. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.

### HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION

* Other Information. “Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This might include, for instance, browser and device information; App usage data; information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies; demographic information and other information provided by you; or aggregated information.
