If the amount is not credited into the Savings Account using this option or the mandate is dishonoured, as a fair practice, you will be provided with a grace  period of 5 days from the date when such amount was expected to be credited into Savings Account.  If the minimum amount i.e. INR 50,000 (Indian Rupees Fifty Thousand) or more is not credited to the account then your Salary Account shall be converted to a Federal Bank Savings Account.
