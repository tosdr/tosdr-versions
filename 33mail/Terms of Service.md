EXCLUDING ONLY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF 33MAIL'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, 33MAIL SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF 33MAIL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM ANY USER'S USE OR INABILITY TO USE ANY 33MAIL SITES OR SERVICES THEREON; THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES; UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE 33MAIL SITES; OR ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE 33MAIL SITES.

### General Information

The Terms constitute the entire agreement between each user and 33Mail and govern each user's use of 33Mail's site and services, superseding any prior agreements. Each user may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when that user uses affiliate services, third party content or third party software. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.

The referred user must actively use the 33mail service over a period of time. This determination will be made at the sole discretion of 33Mail.com.
