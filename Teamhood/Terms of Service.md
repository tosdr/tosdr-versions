However, if the Client has initially accepted such transfer and has not later on informed Eylean in writing about his/her objection, it shall be considered that the Client has given his consent for data transfers until the date of the objection. If the Client objects to such transfer, the Client shall not be able to use those new/integrated services/functionalities anymore.
