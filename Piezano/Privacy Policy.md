California residents should refer to our [Privacy Policy For California Residents](https://buypiezano.com/California-Consumer-Privacy-Act-Disclosures)  
  
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW WE WILL TREAT IT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES, YOUR CHOICE IS NOT TO USE OUR SITES. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR SITES, YOU AGREE TO OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES.

BY VISITING OUR SITES, PROVIDING INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITES, AND/OR PURCHASING A PRODUCT FROM OUR SITES, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO AND ACCEPTING THE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  
  
**1\. Information We Collect  
**When we use the term "personal information" in this Privacy Policy, we mean personal information or personal data that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual, household or device. Personal information does not include information that has been aggregated or deidentified so that it does not identify a specific individual, household or device. The term also does not include information that is encrypted, secured, or modified by any other method or technology that removes elements that personally identify an individual or that otherwise renders the information unusable. Personal information does not include publicly available information.  
  
We may collect personal information when you purchase a product, request a service, request refunds, returns, and exchanges, submit a review, subscribe to communications, respond to a survey, or engage in some other activity on our site. We may ask you for contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. We may ask you for location information, or it may be automatically provided by your browser or device. If you do not want us to collect location information, you can turn off location services in your browser or device.  
  
We may also obtain data about individuals from third party sources, such as financial information, credit history information from credit bureaus, search term and search result information.  
  
We limit the collection of personal information to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary to the purposes for which such information is processed.  
  
**2\. How We Collect Your Information  
**When you visit or interact with our Sites, we and our third-party contractors and service providers (such as advertising and analytics providers) use technologies including trackers, cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear gifs, action tags, and other online tracking technologies (collectively, “online tracking technologies”) to collect personal information including MAC addresses, IP addresses, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types, operating systems and platform, device type, and device identifiers, pages visited on our site, referring and exit pages, the dates and times of the visits, and the terms that you use in searches on our Sites. To the extent that these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a “sale” and or “sharing” (which includes targeted advertising, as defined by applicable laws), under certain applicable U.S. state laws, you can opt-out of these online tracking technologies by clicking the “[Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information](https://emson.com/optout)” link on our Sites or submitting a request as set forth in the Opt-Out Rights section of this [Privacy Policy](https://buypiezano.com/Privacy-Policy).

A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of our website may use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. We may use this information for any purpose permitted by law.  
  
Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you prefer not to receive cookies on our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. Refusing cookies or turning them off may have unpredictable effects on the functionality of the site.  
  
  
  
Our Sites may contain links to other sites. If you use these links, you will leave our Site. When you access a third-party site, even one that may contain our name or logos, please be aware that we do not control the content and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third-party sites linked to our Sites, which are outside of our control.  
  
Our Sites may include social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button, or the “Share This” button.

Social media functions provided by a third party are governed by the Third party’s privacy policy.
