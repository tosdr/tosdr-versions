In addition, User will not use the Forum to distribute chain letters, mass mailings or spam or to gather e-mail addresses for the purpose of sending spam to other users of the Forums. Any conduct by User that, in the Company's opinion, restricts or inhibits any other user from using or enjoying a Web site will not be permitted. User acknowledges and agrees that the Company, in its sole discretion, may at any time for any reason or no reason suspend, terminate, or restrict the User's access to or use of the Web sites, or any portion thereof, with or without notice, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law.

The Company reserves the right (but not the obligation) to monitor Forums to determine compliance with these Terms and Conditions, as well as the right to remove or refuse to post any posting, including, without limitation, any of the above postings upon discovery thereof. Notwithstanding these rights, Users remain solely responsible for the content of User's postings.

[Click here to read our privacy policy](https://patriotpost.us/about/privacy).

### 15\. Copyright Agent.

The Company respects the intellectual property of others, and the Company asks each User to do the same.

The Company's Copyright Agent for Notice of claims of copyright infringement on the Web sites can be reached by directing an e-mail to the Copyright Agent at [\[email protected\]](https://patriotpost.us/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### 16\. Tax Deductibility.

When Mark Alexander launched The Patriot online in 1996, he decided to adopt a donor-support model in order to provide our publications and services to military personnel, students and those in the mission field, without requiring a subscription fee. However, we do not have "501-c-3" tax exemption in order to prevent the IRS from dictating limits on the editorial content of our publications -- which would hinder our mission. Nor do we accept commercial ads in order to prevent advertisers from influencing our editorial content -- which, unfortunately, they do with virtually every other publication.

Supporting The Patriot Post's mission and operation budgets is the most cost effective way to promote Liberty across the nation. However, we are not a 501c-3 or c-4 tax exempt organization, and thus are not able to provide you a tax deduction for your financial support of our mission and operations through donations to The Patriot Annual Fund. Your support may qualify as a professional or business expense.

Separate from the Company, you may wish to support [Patriot Foundation Trust](https://patriotfoundationtrust.org/), which is a 501c-3 tax exempt organization with the primary mission of providing program and academic grant support to foster the proper understanding for our Republic's First Principles -- Liberty and Constitutional Rule of Law over the rule of men.

### 17\. Miscellaneous.

These Terms and Conditions, together with the Privacy Policy, represent the entire understanding of the parties regarding the use of the Web sites and the Publications and supersede any previous documents, correspondence, conversations, or other oral or written understanding related to these Terms and Conditions; provided, however, that there may be additional written terms and conditions that govern User's purchase of products, services, Content, Publications, and other materials through certain portions of the Web site. Such additional terms and conditions, if any, will be specified in the Web sites or by a separate agreement. These Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to its choice of law rules, and, where applicable, the laws of the United States. To the extent permissible by law, any disputes under these Terms and Conditions or relating to the Web sites, the Content, the Publications or other products or services accessible or sold by or through the Web sites will be litigated in the State or Federal courts located, and User hereby consents to personal jurisdiction and venue, in Hamilton County, Tennessee. A modification or waiver of a part of these Terms and Conditions will not constitute a waiver or modification of any other portion of these Terms and Conditions. If for any reason any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions will continue in full force and effect. User agrees that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between User and the Company as a result of these Terms and Conditions or access and/or use of the Web sites. The Company may provide notice to User relating to the Web sites and/or these Terms and Conditions by sending an e-mail to User's last known e-mail address, and any such notice shall be deemed given and received on the day it is sent. The Company shall not be liable for any delays or interruptions in its obligations regarding the sale of any products, subscriptions, or services through the Web sites which are due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, acts of any government, war or other hostility, civil disorder, the elements, fire, explosion, power failure, equipment failure, industrial or labor dispute, inability to obtain necessary supplies and the like.

All users and subscribers of Web site agree to abide by and comply with these "Subscriber/User Terms and Conditions of Service," as set forth by Publius Press, Inc., publisher of The Patriot Post, as a condition of subscription or use.
