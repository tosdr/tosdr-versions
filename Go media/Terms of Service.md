These terms of service (“Terms”) serve as an agreement between you and G/O (“G/O,” “We” or the “Company”) and governs your access to and use of the Services, Sites, and Applications offered by G/O. Your access to and use of the Sites is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.

**User Agreement**

The following Terms describe the terms and conditions on which we offer you access to our Sites and Services, defined below. Capitalized terms used in these Terms shall have the meanings set forth below under “Definitions” or in the text of these Terms.

If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms in their entirety, you must cease accessing or otherwise using the Sites and Services in any way. Your use of any of the Sites or Services constitutes your agreement to these Terms.

We may amend these Terms at any time in our sole discretion, effective upon posting the amended Terms at this URL where the prior version of these Terms was posted or by communicating these changes through any written contact method we have established with you. Your use of the Sites or Services following the date on which such amended Terms are published will constitute consent to such amendments. However, if you cease using the Sites or Services upon such publication, your relationship with us will continue to be controlled by the previous version of these Terms.

9\. **Termination of Agreement**

You may discontinue your use of the Sites at any time without informing us. Subject to the provisions in the G/O Privacy Policy, we may retain and continue to use any Content that you have submitted or uploaded to the Sites.

G/O may, without prior notice, change the Sites, stop providing access to the Sites or features of the Sites to you or to users generally, or create usage limits for the Sites. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Sites without notice and liability for any reason, including if, in our sole determination, you violate any provision of these Terms. In particular, G/O may immediately terminate or suspend accounts that have been flagged for repeat copyright infringement, in accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws.

Upon termination of your access to or ability to use the Sites, including but not limited to suspension of your account, your right to use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Termination of your access to and use of the Sites shall not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability which you otherwise may have to G/O or any third party.

Your access to and use of the Sites or any Content is at your own risk.

THE SITES ARE AVAILABLE “AS IS”: YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SITES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, G/O DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

G/O makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to the Sites, including any representation or warranty that the use of the Sites will (a) be timely, uninterrupted or error-free or operate in combination with any other hardware, software, system or data, (b) meet your requirements or expectations, (c) be free from errors or that defects will be corrected, or (d) be free of viruses or other harmful components. G/O also makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to Content; user Content, in particular, is provided by and is solely the responsibility of the users providing that Content. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from G/O or through the Sites, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.

_Release From Liability_: You release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, G/O, its affiliated entities, parent companies, subsidiaries, directors, officers, shareholders, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, suppliers, and/or distributors from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with the following: (i) Disputes between users, including those between you and other users; (ii) Third party sites and services, including Content found on such sites and services; (iii) Disputes concerning any use of or action taken using your account by you or a third party; (iv) Claims relating to the unauthorized access to any data communications or Content stored under or relating to your account, including unauthorized use or alteration of such communications or your Content.

_Limitation of Liability_: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, G/O, ITS AFFILIATED ENTITIES, PARENT COMPANIES, SUBSIDIARIES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER; (B) LOSS OF: PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES; (C) DAMAGES RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITES; (D) DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY OR SUBSCRIBER USING THE SITES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OR CONTENT; AND/OR (E) DAMAGES IN ANY MANNER RELATING TO ANY CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT G/O HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND FURTHER WHERE A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF G/O AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF FIFTY DOLLARS (USD$50) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE SITE(S).

12\. **Waiver, Severability & Entire Agreement**

_Waiver_: The failure of G/O to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

_Severability_: In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

_Entire Agreement_: These Terms and our [Privacy Policy](http://g-omedia.com/privacy-policy) are the entire and exclusive agreement between G/O and you regarding use of the Sites (excluding any services for which you have a separate written agreement with G/O that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between G/O and you regarding use of the Sites.

**13\. Legal Disputes**

_Applicable Law and Class Action and Jury Waiver_. You hereby agree to resolve all disputes through binding individual arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and that you waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative actions. YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, IN PARTICULAR THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST G/O ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION OR OTHER ACTION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. You agree that the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and G/O, except as otherwise stated in these Terms.

_Binding Arbitration_. If you and the Company are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or the Company may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website [www.adr.org](http://legal.kinja.com/www.adr.org). The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, the Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

_Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes Other Than Copyright Matters_. Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Binding Arbitration provision above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and G/O must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York City, New York. You and G/O agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York City, New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

_Judicial Forum for Legal Copyright Matters_. You agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you (or an entity on whose behalf you are visiting G/O’s sites) and G/O regarding infringement of a copyright must be resolved exclusively by the Copyright Claims Board.

**14\. Statute of Limitations.**
