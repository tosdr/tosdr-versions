##### _Last Updated: 9/27/2019_

Welcome to Privacy4Cars. We care about your privacy, so we want to help you understand what modules the Privacy4Cars Mobile Application (‚ÄúMobile Application‚Äù) has access to, why, and how we treat your data, depending on whether you registered as a Business User or Consumer User. This privacy policy applies only to the information collected through your use of the Mobile Application.

##### **_General_**

We only process your personal information when we have a lawful basis to do so. For purposes of this privacy policy, ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù is defined as information that identifies, or can be used to identify, an individual. We collect personal information from individuals using the Mobile Application. Any references in this policy to ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúyour‚Äù should be interpreted in the context in which the information is processed.

Privacy4Cars is the controller of personal information that you provide about yourself through the Mobile Application. Our legal bases for processing your personal information include your consent, fulfilment of a contractual obligation, and where we have a legitimate interest to process your personal information, provided that our interests do not outweigh your individual rights and freedoms. Our legitimate interests include:

* Investigating, preventing, and protecting against fraud, security risks, threats to you and others, and violations of this policy;
* Protecting and defending our rights and properties, including intellectual property;
* Complying with laws and regulations that apply to us, as well as responding to requests from law enforcement or government authorities or as otherwise required by law;
* Improving your experiences with our products and services;
* Understanding and improving our mobile app, website, user experience, and customer relationships; and
* Enabling our business operations.

Where we rely on your permission to process your personal information, you have the right to change, withdraw or withhold your consent.

##### **_**What Information Collected**_**

There is certain information we need to collect in order for the functions and features of the Mobile Application to properly work. When you use the Mobile Application, we may ask you for the following information or the right to access such information on your mobile device:

* **Consumer Account Registration:** When you register a Consumer User Account, we will collect your name, email address, and password.  
    Business User Account Registration: When you register a Business User Account, we will collect your name, email address, and your role within your business.
* **User Content:** If you choose to submit content to the Mobile Application, we will collect the substance of your User Content, as well as your User name, the vehicle from which you are deleting information, the deletion steps you are following, your location, and the time at which you are using the Mobile Application. If you include any personal information in your User Content, we will collect that information as well.
* **Camera:** If you wish to scan the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) via 1D or 2D barcode, Mobile Application the Mobile Application needs access to your camera. The scanned VIN is decoded which enables the Mobile Application to return data-wiping instructions based on Make, Model, and Year of the scanned VIN data and to uniquely determine which vehicles have been wiped. This may be of particular importance for Business Users (e.g., for compliance purposes).
* **Location:** The Mobile Application asks for access to the User‚Äôs location. Allowing the Mobile Application to access your device‚Äôs location permits us to further enhance features that may be applicable to your region. For Consumer Users, this information is VOLUNTARY, and you can always change your preferences either under the Settings Menu of your phone or simply by disabling Location Services. We may use this information to reach out to businesses near where Consumer Users wiped their systems (e.g., a dealer, a rental car location) in order to raise their awareness and sensitivity to protecting the privacy of their customers and employees (all data will be aggregated, de-identified, and anonymized). If you are using the Mobile Application as a Business User, we are required to collect your location based on our agreement with our Customer (the business, company, or legal entity to which your Business User Account is tied). By registering a Business User Account, you consent to our collection and use of your location data.
* **Make and Manage Phone Calls:** The Mobile Application requires a one-time access to your device/phone ID. This will prompt a message on your phone that the Privacy4Cars app requests the ability to make and manage phone call. However, WE PLEDGE:

* 1. We will NOT use this permission to gather any info beyond your Phone ID
    2. We will NOT make or manage any phone calls
    3. We will NOT share this information with third parties
    4. We will NOT use your Phone ID for any purpose other than for security purposes

* To maintain the security of the Mobile Application and prevent fraud
