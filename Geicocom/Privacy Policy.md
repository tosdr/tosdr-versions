### SUMMARY

This summary tells you the basics of our privacy commitment to you: how we process information that can be used to reasonably identify you or your household, directly or indirectly ("Personal Information"), how we protect it, and who can see it. You should read the entire Privacy Policy below for full details.

* We obtain Personal Information from you directly, from your transactions with us, and from third parties such as state motor vehicle departments.
* We do not and will not sell or share (as those terms are defined under data privacy and security rules and regulations ("Data Protection Laws")) your Personal Information.
* Any third parties who perform services for us are required to safeguard any Personal Information that they process on our behalf.
* We use technical, physical, and administrative measures to secure and limit access to your Personal Information.

### THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The following sections tell you more about how and when we collect your Information.

For California Residents, please click [here](#california_residents_collection) to see the categories of Personal Information that we may collect.

#### PERSONAL INFORMATION WE OBTAIN FROM YOU

During the quoting, application, or claims handling processes you may give us Personal Information such as your:

* Name
* Address
* Phone number
* Email address
* Social Security number
* Driver's license number
* Date of birth
* Claims-related data including occupational information and health data

If you give us your email address, GEICO may use it from time to time to notify you of such things as new services, special offers, to confirm transactions, or provide claims related updates. If you do not wish to be contacted by email for non-policy related communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions at the bottom of any GEICO email you receive.

If you provide your mobile phone number, with your consent we may send you text messages regarding your customer account.

If you are a policyholder, you can also log in to your account at geico.com, click on "Update Email Preferences" on the right side of the screen and choose the level of communication you'd like to receive from us. If you have not yet enrolled online, you will need to enroll with geico.com to update your email preferences.

We may also collect Personal Information when you visit our website. However, GEICO's website processes standard opt-out preference signals in a frictionless manner. You can implement a standard opt-out preference signal through any legitimate web browser. When our website recognizes a standard opt-out preference signal, such as the Global Privacy Control ("GPC") signal, your Personal Information will not be collected for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. You can learn more about GPC by [clicking here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

#### INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR TRANSACTIONS

We may collect Personal Information about your transactions and experiences with us and others, such as your payment history, claims, coverage, and vehicle changes.

#### INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES

We may receive Personal Information about you from service providers and third parties, like consumer reporting agencies that provide us with motor vehicle reports, claim reports, and/or credit information where permitted by law. When you ask for a rate quotation, we may obtain credit information if permitted by applicable state law. Our sales and service representatives do not have access to the details of your credit information. Other companies who view your credit report will not see the GEICO inquiry. It will be visible only to you. Our inquiry will not affect your credit score or credit rating. If you are purchasing a commercial policy, we may also confirm the motor vehicle records and claims history of the employees you will have driving on your company's behalf. We may receive claims related data, including information from potential lienholders (e.g., for child support or Medicare). This information is necessary for GEICO to process claims in compliance with applicable law.

#### LOCATION SERVICES

Your current location is only collected and used by us if you permit our services to do so. If you allow your location to be collected using a GEICO app, or with a browser, we will use this Personal Information to determine your estimated location. We use this Personal Information to distinguish your current location and provide location-related services to you.

#### ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

If you are a resident of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, or Virginia, you have the right to request access to and correction of the Personal Information that we have collected from or about you. To do so, simply contact GEICO's customer service department. If you'd like to correct information that you provided to us, our representative will make the appropriate adjustments to GEICO's records. If you wish to correct Personal Information provided to GEICO by a third party (such as a credit rating agency) the representative will provide you with the applicable third party's contact information. Upon written request, we will provide you with a more detailed notice of these rights. Upon the request of residents of other states, we will take reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the Personal Information in our records.

If you are a California resident, please go to the section of this policy titled "[California Residents](#california_residents)" for information regarding additional rights you may have, including the right to know and right to delete, designated methods for submitting requests, and the categories of information we collect.

### THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE DISCLOSE

The Personal Information collected about our customers, former customers, applicants, independent contractors, and employees, will only be disclosed as permitted or required by law.

For our customers and former customers, much of this collected Personal Information is maintained in your policy and/or claims records. We use this Personal Information to process and service your policy; to settle claims; with your consent; or as directed by you.

Following are some examples of how we may disclose your Personal Information:

* When you are involved in a claim, policy information is provided to adjusters and the businesses that will repair your vehicle.
* We may disclose Personal Information with persons or organizations that we have determined need the Personal Information to perform a business, professional, or insurance function for us. These include businesses that help us with administrative and marketing functions. If the law in your state permits, we may share Personal Information with financial institutions with which we have a joint-marketing agreement. All of these entities are obligated to keep the Personal Information that we provide to them confidential and to use the Personal Information only for the purpose for which the Personal Information was provided.
* Personal Information may be provided to organizations conducting actuarial research or audits. In this case, you will not be individually identified in any research report. The organization must agree not to redisclose the Personal Information and the Personal Information will be returned to us or destroyed when it is no longer needed.
* We may also share your Personal Information for other permitted purposes, including:

* with another insurance company if you are involved in an accident with their insured
* with our reinsurers
* with insurance-support organizations that detect and prevent fraud
* among the GEICO companies listed below and other subsidiaries of GEICO Corporation to offer you additional products and services
* with service providers to deliver website and mobile app content based on your location, but only after obtaining your consent
* with consumer reporting agencies as permitted by law
* with medical professionals or institutions to verify coverage or conduct operations or services audits
* with state insurance departments or other governmental or law enforcement authorities if required by law or to protect our legal interests or in cases of suspected fraud or illegal activities
* if ordered by a subpoena, search warrant or other court order or mandatory government or law enforcement process
* if necessary to defend our legal rights, or protect our employees or customers
* in the event of a business transaction involving the sale of all of or a portion of our business or assets in which case we will comply with applicable laws regarding notice and consent in such transfers

### CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY

We restrict access to your Personal Information to personnel who we have determined need it to provide products or services to you. We train our personnel to safeguard customer Personal Information, and we require them to sign confidentiality agreements.

We maintain a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access by third parties.

Personal Information about our former customers and about individuals who have obtained quotes from us is safeguarded to the same extent as Personal Information about our current policyholders.

**Your Security is Important**

Please see our [Internet Security Policy](https://media.geico.com/legal/security_policy.htm) for further information on how we protect your Personal Information on the Internet.

Geolocation data is used to provide services to consumers, as explained above; citizenship or immigration status is used for employment reasons such as work visas; credit card information is collected for financial transactions; driver's license numbers and social security numbers are obtained to verify individuals and offer accurate ratings; health information is used for claims management.

We have not sold consumers' Personal Information in the 12-month period preceding the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy. We have shared IP addresses for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes in the past 12-month period; however, we do recognize standard opt-out preference signals in a frictionless manner, as explained in the "Information We Obtain from You" section, above. GEICO retains each category of Personal Information, including sensitive Personal Information, for legal, compliance and business purposes. The retention criteria vary depending on these purposes which impact, among other processes, claims handling, litigation, and providing applicable employee benefits. However, GEICO's policy is to retain Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary for any of the purposes disclosed above.
