**_Pixels_** : A pixel is code that placed on the website. It helps to track conversions from ads, optimize ads based on collected data, build targeted audiences for future ads, and remarket on pixels’ third party (such as third party sites and social media) to qualified leads—users who have already taken some kind of action on the website- learn more about pixels [here](https://skillcrush.com/2012/07/19/tracking-pixel/)

**_Tags_** **:** Ad Tags are the HTML code a browser uses to fetch an advertisement from an Ad Server – it is a redirect to content rather than content itself. Learn more about tags [here](https://wiki.appnexus.com/display/industry/Ad+Tags)

**_Javascript_** _:_ This script is implemented in the source code of our website. We use it to create interactive effects within web browsers but we do not collect any personal data by means of this technology.

Note that failure to allow the use of cookies and other technologies means that certain services or functionalities of the website will not be available to the user and/or will not work properly.

What types of cookies does Softonic uses and what for?
------------------------------------------------------

**Technical and UI Customization cookies** to store your preferences across web pages (e.g. language) and not linked to other persistent identifiers. These cookies are always active as are strictly necessary for you to have an adequate experience on the website. Technical cookies are used to provide certain functionalities such as keeping track of your input when filling online forms, keeping track of the items the user has selected by clicking on a button, securing the service, storing technical data needed to play back video or audio content, integrating social plug-in modules and to authenticate you upon log on to pages that requires identification / authentication. These cookies are always active as are strictly necessary to provide you with what you would expect as an acceptable service behaviour of any website.

**Analytics cookies** (such as our own and those of _Google_, _ComScore_ or _Hotjar_). These cookies are used to analyse the visits made, places, behaviour and times of website navigation. The cookie information is transmitted to and stored directly by the analytical providers on their servers. These cookies are used anonymously, in aggregate form, to prepare website trend reports and analyse traffic to finally enhance your experience.

* Google Analytics is service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyse how users use our website. The information generated by these cookies (including your truncated IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of our website, compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Please note that Google only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify (approximately) the country from which you are visiting our sites, but is not sufficient to identify you, or your computer or mobile device, individually. The maximum retention period of the data is 14 months. You can find more information [here](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) including a link to [Google’s privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) .
* _Hotjar_ is a service provided by Hotjar Ltd a company located in Malta (EU). It helps us to understand how you use and interact our website by visually representing their clicks, taps and scrolling behaviour. We use the service to help understand and interpret user behaviour anonymously, without personally identifying individual users. An automatic 365-day data retention period is enforced to ensure all analytics data older than 365 days collected through Hotjar is systematically deleted. Find more information [here](https://www.hotjar.com/privacy/gdpr-compliance).
* _Datadog_ is a service provided by Datadog, Inc, a company located in Delaware (U.S). Datadog service provides us with a visualisation on how the users interact with our websites in an aggregated and/or anonymised way with the aim of identifying errors, enhance the service and better monetise our websites.  The maximum retention period of the data is 15 months. Find more information [here](https://www.datadoghq.com/legal/privacy/).

**Advertising Cookies** . We use cookies to make advertising more attractive to users. Cookies are often used to select ads based on content that is relevant to a user, improve reporting of ads campaign performance and avoid showing ads that the user has already seen. Conversion cookies are also used so that advertisers may determine the number of times that people who click on the ads end up buying their products. These cookies allow Softonic and the advertiser to know that you have clicked on the ad and that you have subsequently accessed the site of the advertiser.

To serve you interest-based ads, we use information such as your interactions with Softonic sites, content, or services. We do not use personally identifiable information such as name or e-mail to serve interest-based ads. In serving you interest-based ads we only keep information collected for as long as required to provide our advertising services.

We and our partners use the information collected by means of these cookies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on Softonic sites and third-party sites. We work with DoubleClick, a platform provided by Google Ireland Limited, which helps us gather information about our audience, helping us to manage the ads and marketing campaigns that are published on our website (positions, campaign duration, formats, link, tracking, etc). Approved third parties’ ad partners may also set cookies when you interact with Softonic. Third parties include social media networks and advertising companies. Third parties use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to perform services on behalf of Softonic. You can always check the third parties that set cookies and set your consent preferences for every partner listed individually by clicking “**Cookie Settings**” at the bottom of the page and then “**View our partners**“: Click on a partner name to get more information on what it does, what data it is collecting and how it is using it.

We work with third parties, such as advertisers, publishers, social media networks, search engines, ad serving companies, and advertising companies working on their behalf, to improve the relevance of ads we serve. In providing you interest-based ads we do not associate your interactions on unaffiliated sites with personally identifiable information, and we do not provide any personally identifiable information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads. Advertisers and other third parties may assume that users who interact with or click on an interest-based ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who has viewed a page of a particular software). They may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, show you more relevant advertising content, and perform services on behalf of Softonic.

Softonic offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. You can choose not to receive interest-based ads from Softonic. You will still see ads, but they will not be based on your interests. Please visit our Cookies settings page at the bottom of the page to learn how to set your preferences.

Our website further uses other advertising IDs (such as the ones from Criteo and Facebook pixels, and Liveramp for US and India Softonic’s websites). These enable us to show our advertisements to visitors who are interested in our products on partner websites and apps. Re-targeting technologies use your cookies or advertising IDs and display advertisements based on your past browsing behaviour. In particular, Facebook Pixel is placed by Facebook; It is a third-party advertising type of cookie that enables Softonic to measure, optimize and build audiences for advertising campaigns served on Facebook. It enables Softonic to see how our users move between devices when accessing the Softonic web site and Facebook, to ensure that Softonic’s Facebook advertising is seen by our users most likely to be interested in such advertising by analysing which content a user has viewed and interacted with on the Softonic web site. Specifically, when you visit a download page or download any software, we share with Facebook the program name visited or downloaded, so based on your behaviour, Facebook will display related ads when visiting Facebook. For further information about the Facebook Pixel please go [here](https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616.). To read more about the Criteo pixel please go [here](http://www.criteo.com/privacy).

Liveramp Pixel (only applicable for the U.S. and India Softonic’s websites) helps companies to serve online display media on third party websites and apps based on previous activity, while keeping your data anonymous and secure. Liveramp does not place “tracking” cookies that correlate activity across websites; instead, Liveramp place anonymized demographic and interest data into cookies. Cross-site web-browsing activities are neither tracked nor stored by Liveramp. To learn more about how Liveramp collect and use information for online advertising, please go [here](http://liveramp.com/privacy/).

We also use ID5 Universal ID. This technology enables us to create unified anonymous IDs that are unique for each visitor and are used to display personalised advertisements to you by means of a first-party cookie, which may capture your IP address, browser version and/or type , operating system version and / or type. ID5 Universal ID also enforces your privacy preferences and prevents data leakage by ensuring only companies that you have authorized via your consent preference to read or use the ID.

Please go to [youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) to learn more about behavioural advertising and to know the steps you can take to protect your privacy on the internet

Our website uses JavaScript too to detect the use of ad blocking extensions for web browsers. This script is implemented in the source code of our website. The script simulates the display of an ad and confirms that it is displayed on a user’s device. To do this, we do not store any information on users’ devices and process no personal data. If we detect that a user deploys an ad blocker, we may interact with them on the use of ad blockers and/or adapt the content available to them. If a user no longer wants us to use ad blocker detection mechanisms, they may opt-out by leaving the web site. We reserve the right to restrict access to our websites if users do not agree to the use of ad blocker detection mechanisms.
