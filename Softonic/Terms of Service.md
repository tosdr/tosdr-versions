Users acknowledge and agree not to have any right, title or interest over those intellectual property rights, nor have right to use, except to the extent permitted under these Terms of Use. Consequently, none of the rights or obligations conferred or assumed under this Terms of Use will be construed as an assignment or license, in whole or in part, of the industrial and intellectual property rights over the Website or any of the parts thereof, or affect the ownership thereof, unless it is expressly provided otherwise.

It is expressly prohibited to reproduce, distribute, modify, transfer, communicate or make available to the public, extract, reuse, resend and in any other manner use by any means the Website or any of the parts or elements thereof (including, but not limited to text, design, graphics, information, data, archives, sound files and/or images, logos, etc.), unless the holder of the relevant rights (either SOFTONIC or a third party) has provided its prior written authorization or if it is permitted by law.

Users must not use any part of the information, content or material on the Website for commercial purposes without obtaining a license to do so from SOFTONIC or its licensors.

Provided that they are not obtained or used for commercial or professional purposes but for private purposes only and in accordance with that established in the applicable legislation, users may view and obtain temporary private copies of the information, materials, and content of the Website in their computer systems (hardware and software).

Each party will immediately inform the other one, through any of the contact ways referred to in these Terms of Use, of any violation of intellectual or industrial property rights they may be aware of, and shall fully cooperate in the defense of such rights.

Nothing in these Terms of Use excludes or limits SOFTONIC liability for death or personal injury, for gross negligence or willful misconduct, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.

To the extent permitted by law, SOFTONIC excludes all conditions, warranties, representations or other terms which may apply to the Website or any information, content or material on it, whether express or implied.

SOFTONIC reserves the right to terminate the users’ access to the Website as well as the provision of any or all content or service provided through it at any time and without notice, for technical, security, maintenance or power failure reasons or any other reasonable cause.

Accordingly, SOFTONIC does not guarantee the reliability, availability or continuity of the Website, the content or the services, so that the use of them by users is done at their own risk, and SOFTONIC cannot be held liable for any loss or damage arising under or in connection with the use of, or inability to use the Website or services or the discontinuance or unavailability of the Website or services.

SOFTONIC will not be held liable for any interruptions to such services, delays, errors, malfunctions and, in general, any other problems that originate from causes beyond the reasonable control of SOFTONIC, and/or due to willful misconduct or fault of users and/or due to Force Majeure. Force Majeure is understood to include all those events beyond the reasonable control of SOFTONIC, such as failures of third parties, operators or service companies, acts of government, lack of access to third-party networks, acts or omissions by public authorities, those produced as a result of natural disasters, power outages, and the attack by hackers or other third parties to the security or integrity of the system. In any case, whatever their cause to the extent permitted by the applicable law, SOFTONIC shall have no liability whatsoever for any direct or indirect damages, consequential damages and/or loss of profits.

To the extent permitted by the applicable law, SOFTONIC excludes all liability for damages of any kind that may result from the lack of truthfulness, accuracy, completeness and/or timeliness of the content transmitted, stored, made available or received, obtained or accessed through the Website, nor for the content provided or offered by third parties or entities.

8.- Links to third party sites (outbound links)
-----------------------------------------------

The Website may include technical linking devices, directories, and even search tools that allow users to access other sites (“**Linked Sites**“) solely with the purpose to facilitate the search for and access to information, content, and services available on the Internet.

In the event that users consider that a Linked Site contains illegal or inappropriate content then they should promptly contact SOFTONIC via email (legal@softonic.com), indicating: (a) the name of the sender, telephone number and email address for responses; (b) a description of the facts that reveal the illegal or inappropriate nature of the Linked Site; and, (c) a confirmation that the information contained in the communication is an accurate statement.  However, in no event will such a communication imply an automatic removal of such Linked Site, nor does it imply any actual knowledge by SOFTONIC of the activities and/or contents specified by the sender. SOFTONIC reserves the right to delete any link already published on the Website if the relevant Linked Site undergoes any change or when the content and/or services do not comply with the principles or provisions of these Terms of Use or with the current legislation.

In no event does the existence of Linked Sites deem the existence of agreements or any business relationship between SOFTONIC and those who run, manage, are responsible for or owners of such Linked Sites, nor the support, approval, recommendation, promotion or identification of SOFTONIC with the content or services offered by them.

SOFTONIC (i) does not assume any responsibility for the content or services of other websites, and shall not be held liable for any losses or damages caused by the unlawfulness, quality, unavailability, error or use of the content and/or services of the Linked Sites nor for any other damage that is not directly attributable to SOFTONIC except for that which may be set out herein; and (ii) does not guarantee the absence of viruses or other similar elements which may cause alterations in the users’ information systems (hardware and software), electronic documents and/or files.

If users choose to visit and/or use any of the Linked Sites then they do so at their own risk and must take appropriate protective measures against viruses or other harmful elements.

9.- Links to the website (inbound links)

In the event that a third party links to any of SOFTONIC’s Websites domain or subdomain names (or a specific country variant of such domain), SOFTONIC may seek, at any time and without providing the reasons for the request, the removal of any link to the Website, after which the party responsible for such site should immediately proceed to the elimination of such inbound link.

The insertion of the link will in no event imply the existence of agreements or a relationship between SOFTONIC and the relevant third party or the approval by SOFTONIC of the content and services offered in the relevant website.

10.- Privacy and protection of personal data
