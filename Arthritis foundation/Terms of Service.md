Thank you for visiting [www.arthritis.org](https://www.arthritis.org/) and/or our mobile apps (collectively, the “Sites”), all of which are offerings of the Arthritis Foundation.  By accessing or using a Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.  If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, you may not access or use any Site. 

**1\. ELIGIBLE USERS**

Each Site is intended for use only by adults, except any pages within a Site that expressly provide that they are intended for use by individuals under the age of 18.  If you are under the age of 18 but at least 13 years old, you may use those pages, but only if (a) your use has been approved by your parent or legal guardian, and (b) he or she has agreed to the Terms of Use on your behalf.  Under no circumstances may a minor under the age of 13 use a Site without parental supervision during use.

If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor who is permitted to use a Site pursuant to the preceding paragraph, you represent and warrant to the Arthritis Foundation that you have the legal capacity to agree to the Terms of Use on the minor’s behalf, and you agree that you are and will be fully liable and responsible for any access to and use of the Site by the minor. 

Each Site is further intended for use only by individuals who access the Site from within the United States of America.

**2\. PERMISSIBLE USE**

The purpose of each Site is to provide information, support and resources to individuals living with arthritis or related medical conditions, their families and friends, and others interested in our cause.  We hope you find our Sites informative and engaging.  You may use the Site for personal, non-commercial purposes only.  

There are some ground rules for your access to and use of a Site which we feel are important to protect our rights and to establish and maintain a positive and productive environment for our users.  As a result, the following restrictions apply to your access and use:

**(a) No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or User Content.**  You may not use, or encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use, a Site for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available User Content (which we define in Section 6 below) that is illegal, harmful, inaccurate, fraudulent, infringing or offensive. Prohibited activities and User Content include:

* Illegal, Harmful or Fraudulent Activities. Any activities that are illegal, that violate the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others, our operations or reputation, including: (i) impersonating or otherwise misrepresenting affiliation, connection or association with, any person or entity, or (ii) offering or disseminating fraudulent goods, services, communications, schemes, or promotions, such as make-money-fast schemes, ponzi or pyramid schemes, phishing, or pharming.
* Infringing User Content. User Content that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others.
* Offensive User Content. User Content that is defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable.
* Harassment. “Stalking” or otherwise harassing any person, or contacting any person who has requested not to be contacted.
* Harmful User Content. User Content or other computer technology that may damage, interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, program, or data, including viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, or cancelbots.
* Content Scraping or Harvesting.  Harvesting or otherwise collecting information about Arthritis Foundation users, including email addresses and phone numbers, or using or attempting to use any automated engine, software, tool, agent, or other device or mechanism (including bots) to harvest, scrape, or extract or otherwise collect Content (which we define in Section 8 below) from the Site.

**(b) No Security Violations.**  You may not use a Site to violate the security or integrity of any network, computer or communications system, software application, or network or computing device (each, a “System”). Prohibited activities include:

**(c) No E-Mail or Other Message Abuse.**  You will not distribute, publish, send, or facilitate the sending of unsolicited mass e-mail or other messages, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (like “spam”) through a Site or to other users identified through access to a Site, including commercial advertising and informational announcements.
