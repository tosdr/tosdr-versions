**6\. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES**

Various federal and state laws provide privacy rights to consumers including the right to know, access, delete, or correct personal information, the right to opt-out of sharing of personal information with affiliates for marketing or the right to opt-out of receiving email marketing.

**Privacy Rights Under CCPA and Similar State Laws:** 

California residents have certain rights under CCPA to access, correct and delete personal information, and other rights described below. Similar rights exist for Virginia, Texas, Oregon, New Hampshire, Connecticut and other states' residents for some of the personal information we collect. While these rights apply only to some of the personal information we collect, for transparency and for your convenience you can submit a request no matter where you live.

**Right to Know and Access Your Personal Information:** You have the right to request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you and the right to know:

* the categories of personal information we've collected,
* the categories of sources from which personal information was collected,
* the business purpose for collecting the personal information, and
* the categories of third parties with whom we disclose or share personal information.

* Comply with a legal obligation, or
* Otherwise use your Personal Information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information. 

**Right to Correct Personal Information:** You have the right to request we correct any inaccurate information we have about you. We may request that you provide documentation to support your request and we will correct your information unless we determine that the personal information is more than likely accurate. 

**Non-Discrimination Rights:** We don't discriminate against you if your exercise any of the privacy rights described in this privacy statement. 

  
**Verified Requests:** To protect you and your personal information, we will only respond to requests to know, access, delete or correct that we have been able to properly verify through our authentication processes. To verify your identity, you will be asked to provide several pieces of personal information, such as name and demographic information, which we only use to verify your identity or authority to make the request.

  
**Authorized Agents:** You may designate an authorized agent to submit an access or deletion request on your behalf. In order to verify that the agent is authorized to make a request on your behalf, we may require you to: (1) provide the authorized agent signed permission to submit a privacy request on your behalf, (2) verify your identity directly with us, and/or (3) directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the privacy request on your behalf.

**Submitting a Request:** To submit an access, deletion, or correction request, please visit the [Access/Correction/Deletion webpage](https://allstateprotectionplans.consumerprivacyinfo.com/) or call us at 1-866-265-4801. Responses to a verified request may take up to 45 calendar days, or longer depending on the nature of the request. If additional time is needed, we will notify you of the additional time. We may only respond to two access requests within a 12-month period. Requests from authorized agents must be submitted via the same online portal or toll-free number but to protect your privacy, consumers will be required to verify their identity directly with us via our online portal or toll-free number. 

**Virginia, Texas, Oregon, New Hampshire, Connecticut and other states' Residents Right to Appeal:** If we are unable to fulfill your request to access, review, delete or correct your personal information, we will respond to you explaining why. If you would like to appeal for additional review of our inability to fulfill your request, please visit the [Appeals webpage](https://appeals.consumerprivacyinfo.com/).

**7\. DATA TRANSFERS, STORAGE AND PROCESSING GLOBALLY**

We operate globally and may transfer your Personal Information to our affiliates or partners companies, service providers, or third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. Wherever your Personal Information is transferred, stored or processed by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your Personal Information.

For transfers of Personal Information (referred to as personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR’)) outside of the United Kingdom (“UK”) and European Economic Area (“EEA”) our affiliates execute standard contractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission in respect of transfers of Personal Data. Under the GDPR, SquareTrade, Inc. and our affiliates act as joint data controllers.

**EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles**

We comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. We have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of Personal Information received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view our certification, visit the [Data Privacy Framework webpage](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/). 

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, we commit to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit [TRUSTe Feedback and Resolution System](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request) for more information or to file a complaint. The services of TRUSTe are provided at no cost to you. In certain cases, the DPF provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the [DPF Principles webpage](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/framework-text). 

If we transfer Personal Information to a third party, the third party’s access, use, and disclosure of the Personal Information must also be in compliance with our Data Privacy Framework obligations, and we will remain liable under the Data Privacy Framework for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 

**A Note to Users Outside of the United States:** If you are a non-U.S. user of our sites, applications, or other services, by using these and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Statement. In addition, your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your information, you consent to such transfer.

* * *

**8\. SOCIAL MEDIA, LINKS AND EXTERNAL SITES**

Links to other company’s sites may be provided on our sites as a convenience to you. If you choose to go to these external sites, you will be subject to the privacy practices of those external sites; we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our sites to read the privacy policies or statements of every site you visit, as those privacy policies or statements may differ from ours. Our Privacy Statement applies solely to the sites where this Privacy Statement appears.

Our sites include Social Media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

* * *

**9\. SECURITY**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use a combination of reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Information. However, no site, application, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” So, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse.

We limit access to your Personal Information to those who need it to do their jobs. We comply with all applicable federal and state data security laws.

* * *
