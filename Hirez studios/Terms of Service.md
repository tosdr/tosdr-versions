5. Accounts.



In order to be a registered user of the Service and the Software Product, you must have or establish an

account with Hi-Rez (“Account”) and complete Hi-Rez’s online registration process. Hi-Rez does not provide

Internet access, and you are responsible for all fees associated with your Internet connection. By accepting

this Agreement and completing the Account registration process, you represent that you are an adult 18

years of age or older. If you are under the age of 18, you must have the consent of a parent or guardian

who is willing to provide their identity and details upon request. Only one person may use an Account. The

registered user of an Account may use the Account or may choose instead to permit a child of the registered

user who is at least thirteen (13) years of age to use the Account. You are liable for all activities conducted

through your Account, and parents or guardians are liable for all activities of their minor child conducted

through the Account. To create an Account, you must select a login name and password. Your login name

is your Hi-Rez online identity. You may not use a login name that is used by someone else, and your login

name cannot be vulgar or otherwise offensive, or be used in any way that violates this Agreement,

applicable law or another person’s proprietary rights. You must provide truthful and accurate information in

creating your Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your

login name, password and Account. You should not reveal your Account information to anyone else or use

anyone else’s Account. You agree to immediately notify Hi-Rez of any unauthorized use of your Account

or any other breach of security of which you are aware. Hi-Rez shall not be responsible for any damages,

losses or expenses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account and you agree to indemnify and

hold Hi-Rez harmless for any improper or illegal use of your Account. This includes, without limitation, any

illegal or improper use by someone to whom you have given permission to use your Account. Your Account

is at risk if you let someone use it inappropriately, and your Account is subject to termination if you or

anyone using your Account violates this Agreement. If your Account is terminated, you may not join the

Service again without our express prior written permission. By agreeing to this Agreement, you agree that

you license through this and other agreements, and do not own, either the Account you use to access the

Service, the characters, avatars or digital items created through the Account or any additional materials,

features or content accessed or purchased through the Account or Site. Those persons who have complete

the required steps to establish and maintain their Account in good standing are sometimes referred to in

this Agreement as “Members.”



6. Your Information.



The personal information you submit to Hi-Rez or Hi-Rez collects in connection with your use of the Site or

the Service is subject to Hi-Rez’s Privacy Policy at http://www.hirezstudios.com/legal, which is expressly

made part of this Agreement. If you have not already read Hi-Rez’s Privacy Policy, you should do so now.

If you establish an Account or access the Service, (a) you agree to provide accurate, current and complete

information required to register with the Service and establish an Account, and at other points as may be

required in the course of using the Service or Products (collectively “Registration Data”), and (b) you agree

that Hi-Rez may, whether itself or through third party providers, store and use the Registration Data you

provide (such as credit card information) in connection with the Service, including without limitation, for use

in maintaining your Account, all as more fully provided in the Privacy Policy.



7. Online Content.



You understand that by accessing the Site or using the Service or Products, you may encounter content

that may be deemed mature, offensive, indecent or objectionable, which content may or may not be

identified as having explicit language or adult themes, and which may be due to the content or your

interactions with other users in the course of accessing the Site, or using the Service or Products. You

agree that your access and use of the Site, and if applicable to you, your access and use of the Service

and Products, is at your sole risk and that Hi-Rez shall have no liability to you for content that may be found

to be mature, offensive, indecent or objectionable. Most Product descriptions contain the applicable

Entertainment Software Ratings Board rating, if any, and it is your responsibility to be sure that you

understand the rating for any Product prior to purchase. The Service is available for individuals aged 13

years or older. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement carefully

with your parent or legal guardian to make sure that you and your parent or legal guardian understand, and

agree to be bound by, this Agreement before purchasing any Product through the Service or Site. Hi-Rez

HI-REZ STUDIOS TERMS OF SERVICE AND USE

July 12, 2018



does not endorse, approve, or prescreen any content that you or other users post or communicate on the

Service or Site. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Hi-Rez does not assume any

responsibility or liability for content that is generated by Members or other guests on or through the Service

or Site. We reserve the right to remove any content that is objectionable to us for any reason. This

determination is in our sole discretion, and is final. Hi-Rez does not assume any liability for any failure to

remove, or any delay in removing, any content. If we have removed content that you created, we may send

you a warning. If it is a serious offense or you have violated this Agreement before, we may ban you from

participating in the Service and terminate your Account. You also acknowledge that the time that you spend

on the Service or Site is solely for entertainment purposes, and that no value can be attributed to such time.

In particular (but without limitation), you understand that no value can be attributed to the time that you may

spend accumulating digital items or objects or developing content.



8. Digital Rights Management and Usage Rules.



You agree to comply with all local, state, federal, and national laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations

that apply to your use of the Service, Site or any Product. You understand that the Service and Products

purchased through the Service may include a security framework using third party digital rights

management technology (“DRM”) that protects digital information and limits your use of the Service or

Products to certain usage rules established by Hi-Rez and/or its third party licensors or providers (“Usage

Rules”). The DRM may be an inseparable part of a Product, or a separate software component installed

directly to a different section of your hard drive when installing such Product. By purchasing any Product

through the Service or Site you are consenting to any such installation and continued presence of the DRM

on your computer and agreeing to its operation related to the Usage Rules. Such operation may involve the

communication between your computer and the systems involved in regulating the Usage Rules. These

Usage Rules may limit, among other things, the number of machines on which each Product may be

activated or your ability to make copies of each Product. The DRM technology is licensed or provided to

Hi-Rez by third parties, and Hi-Rez shall have no responsibility or liability to you for any issues you

experience due to such DRM technology. The Usage Rules are subject to change at any time and Hi-Rez

makes no promises regarding your ongoing ability to activate Products. You agree to comply with such

Usage Rules, and to not attempt to, or assist another person to, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile,

disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security components related to such Usage Rules for any

reason whatsoever. If you live in a jurisdiction in which any of the foregoing activities may not be prohibited

by applicable law, you agree to notify Hi-Rez prior to engaging in any such activity, and Hi-Rez will have

the right to terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon notice. Usage Rules may be controlled

and monitored by Hi-Rez and/or its third party licensors or providers for compliance purposes, and Hi-Rez

reserves the right, for and on behalf of itself and such third parties, to enforce the Usage Rules with or

without notice to you.



9. Product Requirements.



Use of the Site, Service and Products requires a compatible computer, Internet access (fees may apply),

and certain software (fees may apply), and use of the Service and Products may require obtaining patches,

updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Site, Service and Products involves hardware,

software, and Internet access (high speed Internet access is strongly recommended), your ability to use

the Site, Service and Products may be affected by these factors. You are responsible for being aware of

any particular system requirements for any Product and for your ability to meet such requirements, which

may change from time to time. Applicable system requirements at the time of purchase can be found at

http://www.hirezstudios.com/legal. Certain Products may also require you to register for an account with a

third party (which may require an initial and/or ongoing fee) or to install third party software and content in

connection with their use. Hi-Rez does not assume any responsibility or liability for any such fee, account

or third party software or content.

10. Payment and Delivery.



If you purchase Products from Hi-Rez, the following terms and conditions shall apply.



Pricing and Sales Tax; VAT. Your total price will include the price of the Product plus any applicable sales,

value added taxes or use taxes in effect at the time of purchase, and based on the bill to address. Hi-Rez

reserves the right to change prices and availability of Products at any time, and does not provide price

protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering. Hi-Rez is not responsible for

typographic errors in connection with the Service. If a price is materially incorrect when you place an order

for a Product, you will be entitled to a refund of the difference. You will not be entitled to any refund for price

drops or promotional offerings occurring after the time of your purchase. Failure on Hi-Rez’s part to invoice

you for any applicable sales, value added taxes, use taxes, or other taxes does not relieve you of the liability

to pay such taxes, and you must pay to the applicable taxing authority any such taxes which may be due

as a result of your purchase through the Site or Service.



Orders. Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of

your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. Hi-Rez reserves the right at any time after

receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. We may require additional verification

or information before accepting any order.



Payment for Products. The Service accepts as forms of payment major credit cards and debit cards that

display the MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover logos, PayPal, and such other payment

providers, if any, as may be indicated on the purchase page. If a credit card is being used for a purchase,

Hi-Rez, through its third party provider, obtains a pm-approval from the credit card company for the amount

of the order. You agree to pay for all Products you purchase through the Site or Service, and that Hi-Rez

may charge your chosen payment method (such as credit card or PayPal) for any Products purchased, and

for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) as may be accrued by or in

connection with your Account. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES

AND FOR PROVIDING HI-REZ WITH VALID PAYMENT METHOD INFORMATION FOR PAYMENT OF

ALL FEES. All fees will be billed to the payment method you designate during the checkout process. Hi-

Rez may pre- populate your payment method and related fields, and you will be responsible for verifying

any information in such fields or for changing the payment method designated. Billing to your selected

payment method occurs at the time of purchase. If you use the services of an alternate payment method

provider such as PayPal, you will be bound by that party’s terms and conditions, which are available on that

party’s website. You also may be required to create an account with such payment method provider and to

provide that payment method provider with your credit card or other details. If you want to designate a

different payment method or credit card or if there is a change in status of your payment method, you must

change your information online on the “my account” page of the Service. Hi-Rez reserves the right to change

the payment methods offered at any time.



Electronic Signatures and Contracts. Your use of the Service includes the ability to enter into agreements

and/or to make purchases electronically. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC

SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY SUCH

AGREEMENTS AND TO PAY FOR SUCH PURCHASES. YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE

BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL

TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING

WITHOUT LIMITATION, NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND

APPLICATIONS.



Delivery of Products. On occasion, technical problems may delay, interrupt or prevent the download or

activation of your Product. Your exclusive and sole remedy with respect to any Product that is not

downloadable or able to be activated within a reasonable period will be either replacement of such Product,

store credit or refund of the purchase price paid for such Product, as determined by Hi-Rez. Hi-Rez shall

have no liability for issues encountered with downloading, activating or using Products due to factors

beyond its control, including your computer’s performance and the speed of your Internet connection. In

some cases, certain Products may be “pre-ordered,” meaning you will have the opportunity to purchase

such Product prior to its release, such that you will have the right to such Product upon its release. You

HI-REZ STUDIOS TERMS OF SERVICE AND USE

July 12, 2018



understand that in some instances Product release dates may be delayed and that release dates and times

posted on the Service or Site are only estimates, and you will not be entitled to any refund for a delayed

release date. For such pre-orders, a portion or all of the Product software may be downloaded onto your

computer prior to the release date, though the Product cannot be activated or played until the release date.

Hi-Rez may provide you with the option to have such Product software automatically loaded to your

computer, and by choosing such option you consent to Hi-Rez’s monitoring your computer’s latency for the

purpose of effecting such download. Our obligation to deliver any Product to you shall be complete at the

time when and place where you first receive the information necessary to commence download of such

Product. In all circumstances it is your responsibility to ensure that the Product is correctly and completely

installed on your computer. Once a Product is purchased and you receive the Product, it is your

responsibility to keep the Product from being misplaced, damaged or destroyed, and Hi-Rez shall be without

liability to you in the event of any loss, damage or destruction. Hi-Rez encourages all its users to

appropriately back up the Product files and any other elements associated with the Products (such as key

information).



No Ongoing Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Hi-Rez and its licensors

reserve the right, without liability to you, to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Products,

content, or other materials comprising a part of or sold through the Service or Site at any time without notice.

You acknowledge that some aspects of the Service, Site and Products, and administering of the Usage

Rules, entails the ongoing involvement of Hi-Rez. Accordingly, in the event that Hi-Rez changes any part

of the Service or discontinues the Service, which Hi-Rez may do at its election, you acknowledge that you

may no longer be able to use Products to the same extent as prior to such change or discontinuation, and

that Hi-Rez shall have no liability to you in such case. You understand that nothing in this Agreement entitles

you to any future updates, versions or enhancements to any Product (although Hi-Rez may offer such

updates, versions or enhancements in its sole discretion). The Service is not part of any other product or

offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee

you access to the Service.



11. Customer Assistance With Orders and Refunds.



If you purchase Products, the following terms and conditions shall apply.



Assistance with Customer Orders. For assistance with inquires as to your order or for other billing questions,

please refer to our support page located at https://account.hirezstudios.com/support/default.aspx.



Refund Policy. Please note that certain terms, conditions and restrictions apply to the sale of a Product on-

line through the Service that might not otherwise apply to the sale of physical goods. No refunds will be

issued if your computer does not meet the minimum Product requirements or due to your dissatisfaction

with the Product. If you feel you qualify for a refund please refer to our support page located at

https://account.hirezstudios.com/support/default.aspx.

1\. The Product has NOT been activated;

ARE FINAL.

Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000, as amended, may apply to you and may provide you with

the right to withdraw from your purchase of the Product within fourteen (14) calendar days, commencing

on the date after you purchase the Product (the “Withdrawal Period’). You will lose any such right of

withdrawal if you begin downloading the Product or if Hi-Rez begins the performance of services (including

Period. Our services will commence immediately after you have received a purchase confirmation email.

world must be obeyed online as well. We have zero tolerance for illegal behavior on or through the Site or

service providers, and state, local and federal laws, or foreign or international laws where appropriate.

Ignorance of the law is no excuse. We will terminate your Account and use of the Service and cooperate

You hereby agree that Hi-Rez would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not

specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that Hi-Rez shall be entitled, without bond or other security

or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction with respect

to any breach of this Agreement, which equitable remedies shall be in addition to such other remedies as

Hi-Rez may otherwise have available under applicable law.



27. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.



(a) To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement

(“Dispute”), you and Hi-Rez agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly

provided below) informally for at least 30 days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such

informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one party to the other. Hi-Rez will send its notice

to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to Hi-Rez. You will

send your notice to Hi-Rez Studios, Inc., 3905 Brookside Pkwy, Alpharetta, GA, attn: Account Management

Department, or to such other address or person as Hi-Rez may hereafter direct.



(b) If you and Hi-Rez are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or Hi-Rez

may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively

resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN

COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the

Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the

AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which

are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to

arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an

arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA

Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in

person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in

writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow

applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise

provided in this Agreement, you and Hi-Rez may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings

pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

HI-REZ STUDIOS TERMS OF SERVICE AND USE

July 12, 2018



(c) You and Hi-Rez agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Hi-Rez and you

individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (ii) there

is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action

procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative

capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.



(d) You and Hi-Rez agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning

informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning

the validity of, any of your or Hi-Rez’s intellectual property rights; (ii) any Dispute related to, or arising from,

allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for injunctive relief.



(e) Any arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America. Any

Dispute not subject to arbitration, or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided by a

court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, United States of America, and

you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.



(f) Except as otherwise set forth herein, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under,

the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to choice of

law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of

Goods is expressly excluded. For our customers who access the Service from, and are residents of,

Canada, Australia, Singapore or New Zealand, other laws may apply if you choose not to agree to arbitrate

as set forth above; provided, however, that such laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent required

by such jurisdiction. In such a case, this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms

and conditions hereof. If you access the Service from New Zealand, and are a resident of New Zealand,

The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (“Act”) may apply to the Service as supplied by Hi-

Rez to you. If the Act applies, then notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, you may have

rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are

inconsistent, instead of, the rights or remedies set out in this Agreement. Those who choose to access the

Service from locations outside of the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, or New Zealand do so

on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are

applicable.



(g) You and Hi-Rez agree that if any portion of this Section 27 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any

portion of 27(d)) that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and

effect. If Section 27(d) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Hi-Rez will elect to

arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of Section 27(d) found to be illegal or unenforceable and

such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Fulton, State of

Georgia, United States of America, and you and Hi-Rez agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that

court.



28. Miscellaneous.



This Agreement constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the

subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements. The provisions of Sections 4,

7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any

reason. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and

the remainder of the Agreement shall be given full force and effect.
