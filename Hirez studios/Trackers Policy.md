What is Do Not Track (DNT)?

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), forthe Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of theironline activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been workingwith industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. Nostandard has been adopted to date. As such, we do not generally respond to “do not track” signals, nor do most otherwebsites.
