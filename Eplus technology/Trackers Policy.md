### Cookie Policy

This cookie policy was last revised on May, 25 2018.

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small text files that are sent by a website to a web browser and contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. This enables the website to identify and track the web browser. Cookies can, among other functions, enable a website to recognize a device each time it visits, remember user preferences and recommend content. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, but rather the computer used. However, some cookies may contain personal information such as user identification numbers.

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a more personalized user experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our website. By continuing to browse and use our website, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.

Different cookies do different things and some are essential to the operation of a website, whilst others are not. The different types of cookies are: 

* Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website.
* Analytical/performance cookies. These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors to our website and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
* Functionality cookies. These are used to recognize you when you return to our website, enabling us to personalize our content for you and remember your preferences.
* Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visits to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and any advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information (in anonymised form) with third parties for this purpose.

To the extent that any personal information is collected through our use of cookies, our Privacy Policy ([http://www.eplus.com/privacy](http://www.eplus.com/privacy) ) will apply to our processing of that personal information.
