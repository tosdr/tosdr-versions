We collect Personal Data on your visit to our websites through cookies, IP information, or other data provided by your web browser or device.  We also collect data that you voluntarily provide to us through your interactions with our websites, contacting us through email forms or if you call, email, write to us or contact us through social media. 

We combine all of this data, together with data provided by third parties as set forth below, to offer you services and to otherwise facilitate the activities described in the following section.

**How will we use your Personal Data?**

**What is our legal basis for Processing your Personal Data?**

The applicable legal basis for which we process your Personal Data for the specific purposes listed above, include the following:

**Cookie and similar technologies that collect Personal Data**

**Cookies**

This website uses a technology called a "cookie". A cookie is a small data file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive, where your internet browser files are kept. A cookie saves you the trouble of reentering certain information in some registration areas because cookies can be used to enable a site to “remember” information a visitor has previously inputted. A cookie also helps deliver content user-specific information to you and track how sections of the website are used. Cookies can be placed on your computer both by us and by third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship, such as web analytic services and advertising network services. With most Internet browsers or other software, you can change your browser settings to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please check your browser instructions to learn more about these functions. If you reject cookies, functionality of the site may be limited, and you may not be able to take advantage of many of the site's features. [Click here to see our website cookie policy.](https://www.eplus.com/cookie-policy) 

**Web beacons**

Our websites and emails use a technology known as web beacons (also known as an “action tag” or “clear GIF technology”) that allows the collection of web log information. A web beacon is a tiny graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web log information is gathered when you visit one of our websites by the computer that hosts our website (called a "webserver").

Web beacons also help analyze the effectiveness of websites by measuring the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.

**Do Not Track**

There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal. Please note that currently our websites and web-based resources do not respond to these signals from web browsers. At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected.
