**What Personal Data do we collect about you?**

Through our websites linking to this Privacy Statement and by information you provide directly to ePlus, we collect and process Personal Data, including data that does not directly identify you by name or include your contact information, but which may be used to identify that a specific computer or device has accessed our website and which if combined with certain other information could be used to identify you.

The Personal Data we process about you includes the following categories of Personal Data:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| * Name;<br>* Login Information;<br>* Business contact information (address, telephone, email address);<br>* Demographic data (date of birth, gender, country of residence);<br>* Online identifiers<br>* Internet Protocol (IP) address; | * Third party cookies;<br>* Website Interactions (Uniform Resource Locators (URL) Clickstream, Scrolling, Clicks, Mouse-overs)<br>* Social media use and utilization;<br>* Geo-location data, as may be transmitted from your smart phone or other location-aware devices |

We collect Personal Data on your visit to our websites through cookies, IP information, or other data provided by your web browser or device.  We also collect data that you voluntarily provide to us through your interactions with our websites, contacting us through email forms or if you call, email, write to us or contact us through social media. 

We combine all of this data, together with data provided by third parties as set forth below, to offer you services and to otherwise facilitate the activities described in the following section.

**How will we use your Personal Data?**

Processing of your Personal Data includes where we may record, organize, structure, store, adapt or alter, retrieve, consult, use, disclose by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise make available, align or combine, restrict, erase, or destroy your Personal Data.

For any additional purposes where we are required to notify you and get your consent, including those purposes required by local law, we will obtain your consent before we process your Personal Data for those purposes. 

**What is our legal basis for Processing your Personal Data?**

The applicable legal basis for which we process your Personal Data for the specific purposes listed above, include the following:

* **Based on your consent:**  In some cases, at the point at which you provide Personal Data, we will ask you for your consent to collect and process your Personal Data.  If you choose to provide us with your consent, you may later withdraw your consent (or opt-out) by contacting us as described in the “how do you contact us” section below.  Please note that if you withdraw your consent it will not affect any processing of your Personal Data that has already occurred.  Where we process your Personal Data based on consent, we will provide more detailed information to you at the time when we obtain your consent.

* **Compliance with applicable laws or performance of a contract:**  In specific circumstances, we may need to process your Personal Data to comply with a relevant law/regulation or to fulfill our obligations under a contract to which you are subject.  Where we process your Personal Data to meet our legal obligations, you will likely not be permitted to object to this processing activity, but you will usually have the right to access or review this information unless it would impede our legal obligations.  Where we are processing to fulfill our contract obligations under a contract where you are a party, you might not be able to object to this processing, or if you do choose to opt-out or object to our processing, it may impact our ability to perform a contractual obligation that you are owed.

* **Our legitimate interest:**  We process your Personal Data based on our legitimate interests in communicating with you and managing our interactions with you regarding our products and services.  In addition to the other rights you may have described below, you have the right to object to such processing of your Personal Data.   You can register your objection by contacting us as described in the “how do you contact us” section below.

**Cookie and similar technologies that collect Personal Data**

**Cookies**

This website uses a technology called a "cookie". A cookie is a small data file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive, where your internet browser files are kept. A cookie saves you the trouble of reentering certain information in some registration areas because cookies can be used to enable a site to “remember” information a visitor has previously inputted. A cookie also helps deliver content user-specific information to you and track how sections of the website are used. Cookies can be placed on your computer both by us and by third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship, such as web analytic services and advertising network services. With most Internet browsers or other software, you can change your browser settings to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please check your browser instructions to learn more about these functions. If you reject cookies, functionality of the site may be limited, and you may not be able to take advantage of many of the site's features. [Click here to see our website cookie policy.](https://www.eplus.com/cookie-policy) 

**Web beacons**

Our websites and emails use a technology known as web beacons (also known as an “action tag” or “clear GIF technology”) that allows the collection of web log information. A web beacon is a tiny graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web log information is gathered when you visit one of our websites by the computer that hosts our website (called a "webserver").

Web beacons also help analyze the effectiveness of websites by measuring the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.

**Do Not Track**

There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal. Please note that currently our websites and web-based resources do not respond to these signals from web browsers.
