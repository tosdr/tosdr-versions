We have no liability whatsoever for editing, removing, or continuing to permit the display of any Submissions.

We may obtain many Submissions on the Website that contain, or otherwise develop on our own, or through third party vendors we engage, ideas, inventions, materials and other content that may be similar or identical in theme, idea, format or other respects to Submissions you make to the Website. For example, SC Johnson is actively engaged in research and development for new products and services, and the creation of marketing and advertising materials and other content related to our products and services or that may otherwise be of interest to other users, on our own and through third party vendors.

NOTICE OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT UNDER U.S. LAW
-----------------------------------------------

SC Johnson controls and operates the Website from the company’s headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin, in the United States of America.

These Terms, and the agreement they create, shall be governed in all respects by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin, U.S.A., without regard to choice of law provisions. Likewise, your use of the Website shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Wisconsin, U.S.A. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to these Terms.

SC Johnson’s failure to exercise, enforce or insist upon strict performance of any right or provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable under applicable law, it will not affect the lawfulness, validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any of these terms and conditions. SC Johnson may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without notice to you.

Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Website must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arises or be forever barred and waived.

In no event shall you seek or be entitled to rescission, injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation or exploitation of the Website, any advertising or other materials issued in connection therewith, or any content or other material used or displayed on the Website. You understand and agree that no fiduciary relationship is established between you and us by your use of the Website. Your use of the Website shall not be deemed to create the relationship of employer and employee, or principal and agent, joint venture or partner between you and us.

While we design the Website to be compatible with the laws of the countries in which we operate, we in no way represent or imply that the Materials on the Website are appropriate or available for use outside of the United States, and access to them from territories where their content is illegal is prohibited. If you use the Website from locations outside of the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. You may not use or export the materials in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO USERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
----------------------------------------------------------------

We strive to create a global community with consistent standards for everyone, but we also strive to respect local laws. The following provisions apply to users and non-users who interact with SC Johnson outside the United States:

* You agree that the Website is subject to the laws of the United States.
* You agree to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States or another country in accordance with our [**Privacy Notice.**](http://privacy.scjbrands.com/en-us)
* If you are located in a country embargoed by the United States, or are on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals you will not engage in commercial activities on the Website. You will not use the Website if you are prohibited from receiving products, services, or software originating from the United States.

PRIVACY
-------

Our [**Privacy Notice**](http://privacy.scjbrands.com/en-us) states in full our policy regarding how we handle information that we collect about you (including through automatic means) or that you choose to submit to us.

FILTERING
---------

Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d), as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors.  Information identifying current providers of such protections is available on the following two sites: [GetNetWise](http://www.getnetwise.org/) and [OnGuard Online](http://onguardonline.gov/). SC Johnson does not endorse, support or approve any of the products or services listed at such sites.

GENERAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO E-COMMERCE
--------------------------------------

Reference to any product on the Website does not constitute an offer to sell or supply that product and does not mean that the product is available or that the name and description of any product from our wholesale distributors will be the same as that included on the Website.

We cannot guarantee that product listed as available will actually ship right away, as inventory can change significantly from day to day. In rare cases, a product may be in stock when you place your order, and sold out by the time your order is processed.

Where applicable, our policies relating to shipping and return/replacement of products are posted on the Website for your review. Review those policies prior to purchasing products from the Website.

Prices and availability of products listed on the Website are subject to change without notice.

While we strive to provide accurate product and pricing information, pricing or typographical errors may occur. In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price due to a typographical error, or any other reason, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order placed for such product at the incorrect price, even if the order has been confirmed and/or your credit card has been charged. In the event that an item is mispriced, we may, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, we shall promptly issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the incorrect price.

There may be certain orders that we are unable to accept and must cancel. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may be applicable to orders placed by or using the same online account, the same credit card, and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. We will provide notification to the customer should such limits be applied.

Some situations that may result in your order being cancelled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is cancelled after your credit card has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card in the amount of the charge.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This is the entire agreement regarding all the matters that have been discussed in the preceding paragraphs.
