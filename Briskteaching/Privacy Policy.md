1\. WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA?

When we use the term “personal data” in this Privacy Notice, we mean any data or information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular natural person or household.  

2\. OUR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA  

We collect personal data in a variety of ways. For example, we may collect personal data when you register for an account on our Service, send us messages, subscribe to our mailing lists, newsletters or other forms of communications, participate in a survey, or integrate our Service with a third-party site or service. In addition, we may collect personal data automatically when you interact with our Service. At times, we may also collect personal data about you from other sources and third parties.  

_Information You Provide_

We collect the following information you provide in connection with our Service:

* **Account Information,** including full name, email address, School name, and other account information that you choose to provide to us.
* **Inquiry and Communication Information,** including information in customer messages sent through forms, in emails, or via phone. For example, if you join our waitlist, then we may ask you to provide your name and state of residence. We use this information to investigate and respond to your inquiries, communicate with you, and enhance the services we offer to our users and to manage and grow our Service.
* **Information Collected Through the Use of the Service,** including any files, documents, videos, images, data, or information you choose to upload or transmit through your communications with us or your use of the Service.

Information from Educators may include Student Records as further described in the ["Student Records"](https://www.briskteaching.com/privacypolicy#section5) section below.

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages. We may also send you Service-related emails or messages (e.g., user account verification, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices) and communications from or about Brisk.  

_Personal Data Automatically Collected_

As is true of many digital properties, we and our third-party partners may automatically collect certain information from or in connection with your device when visiting or interacting with our Service, such as the list below and in the sub-sections here:

* **Information We Receive from Third-Party Sites You Connect to/Integrate with Our Service,** including personal data we may receive about you from third-party platforms, networks, services and/or sites that you integrate with our Service and combine that with information we collect through our Service. For example, if you register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party site or service, such as Google (e.g., Google Classroom, G-Suite including Google Docs, Google Chrome, and Google Drive), we may collect personal data that is associated with your third-party site account. This information we collect may include, for example, your name, email address, courses, Student rosters, course materials, information about Google Doc views, version history, comments, and authentication action information, and Student submissions, including some Student Records. If you create or upload assessments or other academic or educational resources or materials, we collect the content of these materials and metadata you provide about them. The information we receive from these third-party sites is dependent upon that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Service.
* **Log Data,** including internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, device type and version, browser type and version, browser ID, the URL entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, other user agent string data, the time spent on our Service, and any errors that may occur during the visit to our Service). Log data may overlap with the other categories of data below.
* **Analytics data,** including the electronic path you take to our services, through our services and when exiting our services, UTM source, as well as your usage and activity on our services, such as the time zone, activity information (first and last active date and time), usage history (flows created, campaigns scheduled, emails opened, total log-ins) as well as the pages, links, objects, products and benefits you view, click or otherwise interact with. We may also analyze the interaction between you and your customer using our Service.
* **Location data,** such as general geographic location that we or our third-party providers may derive from your IP address, or more precise geolocation with your permission when accessing our online services through a mobile device.  
    

We and our third-party providers may use (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual’s computer and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “cookies”) to automatically collect this personal data. We may also use this information to distinguish you from other users of our Service. This helps us monitor and analyze how you use and interact with our Service. It also helps us and our partners to determine products and services that may be of interest to you. For more information about these practices and your choices regarding cookies, please see the [Control Over Your Information](https://www.briskteaching.com/privacypolicy#section6) and [Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising](https://www.briskteaching.com/privacypolicy#section7) sections below.  

‍

_Personal Data from Third Parties_

We also obtain personal data from third parties. We often combine with personal data we collect either automatically or directly from an individual. We may receive the same categories of personal data as described above from the following third parties:

* **Other Users or Individuals who Interact with our Service.** We may receive your information from other users or other individuals who interact with our Service. For example, if an Educator uses our browser extension to detect AI-generated content in an online document, our Service will process any personal data included in the document.
* **Information we receive from authentication services you connect to our Service:** Some parts of our Service may allow you to login through a third-party social network or authentication service such as Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal data with us, which could include your \[your profile information, profile picture, gender, username, user ID associated with your social media account, age range, language, country, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties\]. The data we receive is dependent on that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also send you service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, purchase confirmation, customer support, changes, or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).
* **Other Sources:** We may also collect personal data about individuals that we do not otherwise have from, for example, publicly available sources, third-party data providers, or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, generate leads, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages about products and services that may be of interest to you.

3\. OUR USE OF PERSONAL DATA

5\. STUDENT RECORDS  

We consider Student Records to be confidential and do not use Student Records for any purpose other than to provide the Service on the School’s behalf, in accordance with contractual agreements with the School. To help Schools address their obligations to protect their students’ data privacy, we have implemented additional controls and procedures for Schools when they enter into a contract with Brisk to use the Service as part of a School’s educational curriculum. When the Service is used as part of a School’s educational curriculum, the personal data related to Students that is (i) provided to Brisk by a School, or (ii) collected by Brisk during the provision of the Service to a School, may include information defined as “educational records” by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or “covered information” under California’s Student Online Personal Data Protection Act (“SOPIPA”), or other information protected by similar student data privacy laws. We call this information “Student Records.”  

As between us and the School, Student Records are owned and controlled by the School. Our collection and use of Student Records is governed by our contracts with the Schools and by applicable privacy laws. For example, we provide the Service to Schools as a “School Official” under FERPA and we work with Schools to help protect personal data from the Student’s educational record, as required by the FERPA.

* We collect, maintain, use and share Student Records only for an authorized educational purpose and as described in our Agreement with the School, or as directed by the School or by the Student’s parent or legal guardian (each, a “Parent”).
* We do not use or disclose Student Records for targeted advertising purposes.
* We do not build a personal profile of a Student other than in furtherance of an educational purpose.
* We maintain a comprehensive data security program designed to protect the types of Student Records maintained by the Service.
* We will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users.
* We will never sell Student Records unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Privacy Notice or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Records by deleting the Student Records before the transfer occurs.
* We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Notice or contractual agreements that relate to the collection or use of Student Records without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before the Student Records are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.

_How We Share and Disclose Student Records_

We disclose Student Records solely as needed to provide the Service on behalf of specific Schools in accordance with our contractual agreements with those Schools or with the consent of the School or Parent. For example, Student Records and account usage data may be disclosed to or accessible by users who are authorized to use the Service on behalf of the School. In addition, depending on the manner in which Brisk is used by the School and the terms of the agreement between the School and Brisk, we may provide access to certain Student Records to the Student and/or to the Parent of the Student about whom the records relate, for the purpose of monitoring Student usage and activity and evaluating the effectiveness of the School’s use of the Service. We also disclose Student Records to our trusted service providers who have a legitimate need to access such information on our behalf, subject to appropriate contractual terms to protect such data.

Furthermore, we may disclose Student Records in connection with a business transaction or to support our legal rights and obligations, as described in our Our [Our Disclosure of Personal Data](https://www.briskteaching.com/privacypolicy#section4) section of this Privacy Notice.

_How We Use De-Identified Data_

We may also generate, use, and disclose de-identified information for adaptive learning purposes or customized student learning purposes, to recommend content or services relating to School purposes or other educational or employment purposes, as well as for development, research and improvement of our Service. In addition, we may use de-identified information for the development and improvement of other educational sites, services and applications or technologies more generally to the extent permitted under applicable law. “De-identified information” means data from which all personally identifiable information has been removed or obscured so that the remaining information does not reasonably identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual.  

_How We Retain Student Data_

We will not knowingly retain Student Records beyond the time period required to support an educational purpose, unless authorized by the School.

_Please note: Schools are responsible for maintaining current class rosters, and for managing Student Records which they no longer need for an educational purpose by submitting a deletion request._

If you are using the Service on behalf of a School and wish to access Student Records, delete Student Records or close your account, please contact us (privacy@briskteaching.com). If you are a Parent or Student and wish to access Student Records, delete Student Records or close your account, please direct your request to your School.

_Questions About Student Data_

7\. THIRD-PARTY TRACKING AND ONLINE ADVERTISING

8\. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY  

Brisk collects and uses Student Records at the direction of and under the control of a School. As such, we rely on each School to provide appropriate notice to Parents of the School’s use of third-party service providers such as Brisk, and for the Schools to provide consent, if necessary, and authorization for Brisk to collect Student Records, as permitted under applicable laws.
