5\. STUDENT DATA  

_In short: We consider Student Data to be confidential and do not use Student Data for any purpose other than to provide the Service on the School’s behalf, in accordance with our contract with the School. For more details about our Student Data privacy practices, please see below._

To help Schools address their obligations to protect their students’ data privacy, we have implemented additional controls and procedures for Schools when they enter into a contract with Brisk to use the Service as part of a School’s educational curriculum. When the Service is used as part of a School’s educational curriculum, the personal data related to Students that is (i) provided to Brisk by a School, or (ii) collected by Brisk during the provision of the Service to a School, may include information defined as “educational records” by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) or “covered information” under California’s Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (“SOPIPA”), or other information protected by similar student data privacy laws. We call this information “Student Data.”

As between us and the School, Student Data is owned and controlled by the School. Our collection and use of Student Data is governed by our contracts with the Schools and by applicable privacy laws. For example, we provide the Service to Schools as a “School Official” under FERPA and we work with Schools to help protect personal data from the Student’s educational record, as required by the FERPA.

* We collect, maintain, use and share Student Data only for an authorized educational purpose and as described in our Agreement with the School, or as directed by the School or by the Student’s parent or legal guardian (each, a “Parent”).
* We do not use or disclose Student Data for targeted advertising purposes.
* We do not build a personal profile of a Student other than in furtherance of an educational purpose.
* We maintain a comprehensive data security program designed to protect the types of Student Data maintained by the Service. For more information about our security practices, please see the **Security** section below.
* We will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users.
* We will never sell Student Data unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Privacy Notice or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Data by deleting the Student Data before the transfer occurs.
* We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Notice or contractual agreements that relate to the collection or use of Student Data without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before the Student Data are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.

_How We Share and Disclose Student Data_

We disclose Student Data solely as needed to provide the Service on behalf of specific Schools in accordance with our contracts with those Schools or with the consent of the School or Parent. 

For example, Student Data and account usage data may be disclosed to or accessible by users who are authorized to use the Service on behalf of the School, for example a school or district administrator. In addition, depending on the manner in which Brisk is used by the School and the terms of the agreement between the School and Brisk, we may provide access to certain Student Data to the Student and/or to the Parent of the Student about whom the data relates, for the purpose of monitoring Student usage and activity and evaluating the effectiveness of the School’s use of the Service. 

We also disclose Student Data to trusted service providers who have a legitimate need to access such information on our behalf, subject to appropriate contractual terms to protect such data. Our current list of service providers is available upon request.

We may also disclose Student Data in connection with a business transaction or to support our legal rights and obligations, as described in the **Our Disclosure of Personal Data** section of this Privacy Notice. 

_How We Use De-Identified Data_

We may also generate, use, and disclose de-identified information for adaptive learning purposes or customized student learning purposes, to recommend content or services relating to School purposes or other educational or employment purposes, as well as for development, research and improvement of our Service. In addition, we may use de-identified information for the development and improvement of other educational sites, services and applications or technologies more generally to the extent permitted under applicable law. “De-identified information” means data from which all personally identifiable information has been removed or obscured so that the remaining information does not reasonably identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. 

_How We Retain Student Data_

We will not knowingly retain Student Records beyond the time period required to support an educational purpose, unless authorized by the School. 

_Please note: Schools are responsible for maintaining current class rosters, and for managing Student Data which they no longer need for an educational purpose by submitting a deletion request._

If you are using the Service on behalf of a School and wish to access Student Data, delete Student Data or close your account, please contact us ([privacy@briskteaching.com](mailto:privacy@briskteaching.com)). If you are a Parent or Student and wish to access Student Data, delete Student Data or close your account, please direct your request to your School.

In addition to our tools for Educators, we are launching [Brisk Boost](https://www.briskboost.ai/), a powerful tool designed to help learners boost their academic progress using AI. 

We may choose to make Brisk Boost available to children under the age of 13. However, Brisk will not collect personal data from children under 13 without appropriate consent or authorization, as follows: 

* When Brisk provides the Service on behalf of a School, the School provides consent for Brisk to collect information from Students under the age of 13 through the Service provided on the School’s behalf, as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). In this case: some text
    * We collect and process personal data from Students under 13 solely at the direction of and under the control of a School, and do not require Students to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to use the Service. 
    * At all times, Schools have the right to request to review or delete the personal data from Students under 13 or decline to permit further collection or use of the Students’ personal data by contacting the School’s account representative. 
    * Schools are responsible for providing appropriate notice to Parents of the School’s use of third-party service providers such as Brisk. We recommend that our School customers provide a link to this Privacy Notice to all Parents. 
    * For more information on how we collect and process Student Data, please see the section on **Student Data** above.
* When Brisk provides the Service directly to children under 13 outside of the school context, we require the child’s parent or legal guardian to provide the appropriate consent or authorization for their child to use Brisk. 
* The parent, legal guardian or school may withdraw consent at any time.

_Data Collected from a Child_

When a child under 13 uses the Service, we will ask for certain information about the child that is typically provided by the adult setting up the Service for the child, which may include the child’s name and information about the child’s parent, guardian or School (as applicable). 

When the child uses the Service, we will collect the following information from the child: 

* Information Collected Through the Use of the Service, including any files, documents, videos, images, or other information the child chooses to provide through the child’s use of the Service.

This information is typically collected through cookies or similar technologies and we may use third-party providers to collect this information on our behalf. We collect this information to help us understand usage, to diagnose problems and provide support, to administer our Service, facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, to remember users’ settings and preferences, to personalize the user’s experience while using the Service, and to recognize a user’s computer or device in order to assist the use of the Service and for security purposes. 

We do not require the child to provide any more information than is reasonably necessary to use the Service. 

_How we share or disclose a child’s personal data_ 

We share or disclose a child’s personal data as needed to provide our Service or with third parties with appropriate consent or authorization. For example, we share a child’s personal data with third parties as authorized by the Parent or the School, such as school administrators, counselors, resource professionals and others subject to appropriate authorization. Similarly, children may communicate with others through the Service subject to appropriate authorization, such as with their teachers.

We also share information with our trusted third-party service providers who provide services to us or on our behalf, such as website hosting and customer support services, information technology and related infrastructure provision, and other services. Our current list of service providers is available upon request.

We may also share personal data if we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, our users or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. If Brisk becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, change of control, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, a child’s personal data may be transferred or disclosed in connection with the business transaction, subject to any applicable laws.

We may also share aggregate or de-identified information in a manner that cannot be reasonably used to identify an individual user.

_How to access and delete a child’s personal data_ 

A parent/guardian has the right to access the personal data we have collected from the child, withdraw consent for further collection and request deletion of the child’s personal data. If you are a Parent of a child under 13 that uses our Service outside of school and you want to access, correct, or delete your child’s personal data, please contact us to submit your request. If you are a Parent of a Student under 13 using the Service through a School and you want to access, correct, or delete the Student’s personal data, please contact your child’s School to submit your request. We will respond to the School’s instructions with respect to your child’s personal data.

Unless we receive a deletion request, we will retain the personal data collected from the child for as long as necessary to provide the Service and comply with our legal obligations, which could include retaining information as needed for recordkeeping and billing obligations. We will delete and/or de-identify the child’s personal data when it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected. 

If you require additional assistance regarding your child’s personal data, please contact us at [privacy@briskteaching.com](mailto:privacy@briskteaching.com). We will respond to all requests as soon as possible. For requests that relate to Students, we may be required to refer the request to the School or School administrator for action.
