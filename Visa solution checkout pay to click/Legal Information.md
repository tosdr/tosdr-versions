Visa Global Privacy Notice
==========================

**Effective date:[](https://usa.visa.com/legal/privacy-policy.html)** March 3, 2023

This Global Privacy Notice explains how Visa and its Affiliates¹ collect, use, and share Personal Information when you use our, or our clients’, products, services, offers, and promotions.

As a global payments technology company, Visa fulfills many roles. When we act on behalf of our Visa clients, we only collect, use, and share Personal Information as authorized by our contracts with our clients. If you have questions about how these companies handle your Personal Information, or wish to exercise your rights, please contact them directly. For example, if you have questions about your Visa card transactions, please contact the institution that issued your card for more information.

Where Visa acts a controller under applicable laws and collects information directly from an individual, the controller is the Visa entity listed on the terms and conditions you sign when enrolling in a Visa service, product, or offer. Some Visa companies and services have different privacy notices that are provided when you use them. We also have supplemental privacy notices that provide additional information as required by law.

You can learn more and exercise your privacy choices under relevant laws at our [Privacy Rights Portal.](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/dd0d9755-b749-45c9-8c89-f768637132db/2820c4d2-137a-425e-bf35-ffb2bab5611d)

Inc. or its parent company Visa Inc. through ownership—for example, Visa International Service Association, Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Canada Corporation, Visa International Servicios de Pago España, S.R.L.,Visa Europe Limited, Visa do Brasil Empreendimentos Ltda, CardinalCommerce Corporation, CyberSource Corporation, and Verifi, Inc.

### Online Privacy

When you visit our website, use our mobile applications, or engage with our emails and online ads, we may collect information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs, and web beacons.

In some cases, the information we collect is only used in a non-identifiable way. For example, we use information we collect about all website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns. We do not use this information to profile you or target our ads.  

In other cases, we may use the information in an identifiable way. For example, we may authenticate you or your device, deliver personalized content or use the information for analytics, fraud detection, and security. We may also use the information for online ad targeting. Our [Cookie Notice](https://usa.visa.com/legal/global-privacy-notice/cookie-notice.html) provides more information about our online data collection technologies and your choices.   

As described in our [Cookie Notice](https://usa.visa.com/legal/global-privacy-notice/cookie-notice.html), we have relationships with third-party advertising companies. These third parties may track you, your browser or your device across different websites and applications.

Subject to your settings, we may place cookies or tags on your computer when you visit our website so that they can display targeted advertisements to you on other websites. The use of your data by these companies is subject to their own privacy policies.  

Many Visa websites only place marketing, personalization, and advertising cookies if you explicitly accept these cookies by clicking “Accept All Cookies” when you first visit the website. Our [Cookie Notice](https://usa.visa.com/legal/global-privacy-notice/cookie-notice.html) explains how to manage your preferences and how to disable previously accepted cookies.

Our websites may enable you to interact with us and others via social media platforms. We collect information from these platforms as permitted by the sites’ legal terms. We may also display interest-based ads to you when you are using these platforms. The platforms allow us to personalize the ads that we display to you, and they may gain insights about individuals who respond to the ads we serve.

Certain mobile applications controlled by Visa may allow us to share data with advertising platforms for purposes of showing you interest-based ads. We rely on the mobile network operators’ settings to allow you to opt into this type of sharing when you download our applications. However, where able, we will also provide you choices within the account profile section of the application.

We collect device identifiers and other device-related information, including your device’s advertising ID, if available. This information is used to identify your device and authenticate you. We may also use device-related information to associate you with different devices that you may use, including for fraud-protection purposes and to better target advertising. In many cases, you can reset your device’s advertising ID. Both Android and iOS devices enable you to reset your device identifier under the “settings” menu.
