==============================

IMPORTANT: PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING VISA SOLUTION TERMS OF SERVICE ("TERMS"). YOU HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS IF YOU HAVE REGISTERED IN THE VISA SOLUTION OR ACTIVATED A CARD FOR THE VISA SOLUTION. THESE TERMS REPLACE ALL PRIOR TERMS IN RESPECT TO THE VISA SOLUTION. 

 

For registrations of the Visa Solution after July 1, 2024, the following section shall apply.

The Visa Solution is subject to cardholder eligibility. You understand that where your Issuer provides Click to Pay, you may not be eligible for the Visa Solution. Visa may however, co-ordinate with your Issuer (including by sharing information you have provided to register for the Visa Solution) to ensure you receive appropriate and streamlined services. If you are ineligible for the Visa Solution, you understand that acknowledgement and confirmation of these Terms does not create an agreement with Visa and the remaining Terms shall not apply. Capitalized terms are as defined in these Terms.

 

1\. The Visa Solution
---------------------

The Visa Solution is operated by Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa”). Contact information for Visa is included under Contact Us in Section L below.

As used in these Terms, the term "Visa Solution" shall mean all of the following: all Visa Click to Pay and/or Visa Checkout features, functionality and services, now available or added in the future, whether branded as Visa Click to Pay, Visa Checkout or a different name, and whether available through the Visa Solution website or mobile site as operated as a domain or subdomain ("Website") or through an application or functionality offered by an issuing bank or payment institution, merchant, or other third party (collectively, "Services"); the logos, designs, text, images, videos, graphics, software and other content and materials of Visa or its licensors available through the Visa Solution, and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, "Content"); and Visa's hardware, software and networks associated with making the Visa Solution available to you (collectively, the "Visa Solution System").

The Visa Solution offers you (i) the ability to store payment account and other related information such as e-mail address, mobile phone number, and billing and shipping addresses ("Card Details") for your Visa credit, debit and reloadable prepaid cards and other cards or payment methods that Visa has decided are eligible to be used with the Visa Solution ("Eligible Cards"); and (ii) the ability to use the Visa Solution to share your Card Details with merchants, or other third parties, that display the Click to Pay icon ‍‍ where Visa is accepted or that display a Visa Checkout mark, to allow them to process a transaction. Visa may automatically update certain Card Details such as card number and expiration date, as provided by the financial institution or other entity which issued your Eligible Card(s) (“Issuer”).

Your Issuer may provide additional information about your Eligible Card(s), such as the availability of rewards points, installments options, and other Eligible Card(s) benefits. If so, we present this information to you in the Visa Solution as-is, as received from the Issuer of your Eligible Card. If you have any questions about this information, please contact your Issuer.  Where applicable, Visa will process your information to determine if you are eligible for these options or benefits, and to display these to you.

When you use the Visa Solution, we will transmit your Card Details to the merchant, or other applicable third party, in order to allow them to process the transaction. Visa may generate a numerical surrogate of your Visa Eligible Card payment account number (a token) to be used in order to help protect your Eligible Cards. You agree that the merchant or other applicable third party can transmit information about the transaction to the applicable network for your Eligible Card and that your transaction will be paid for using the Eligible Card you have selected.

You acknowledge that the Card Details stored or provided through use of the Visa Solution are provided by you or, in certain jurisdictions, on your behalf by your Issuer or a merchant or third party, and contain personal financial information. You may only use Eligible Cards in connection with the Visa Solution if your Issuer regards you as the cardholder or authorized user and your name is shown on the Eligible Card. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the Card Details and other information you store with the Visa Solution or provide through use of the Visa Solution. You must only use valid email addresses and phone numbers owned or controlled by you. Although Visa may perform certain validation checks for Card Details for Visa cards, Visa is not responsible for the accuracy of Card Details or the other information you provide, including whether Card Details are current and up-to-date.

The Visa Solution is not a bank or payment account and does not offer any credit to you or a merchant. Any transaction that you make using the Visa Solution will be reflected in the account which relates to the Eligible Card you use for the transaction. Payment of that account is solely a matter between you and the Issuer of the Eligible Card.

 

2\. Important Notice About Your Transactions
--------------------------------------------

WHILE THE VISA SOLUTION HELPS FACILITATE THE TRANSACTION, VISA IS NOT A PARTY TO THE TRANSACTION AND THE PAYMENT TO OR FROM A MERCHANT IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE VISA SOLUTION, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OR RETURN OF GOODS OR SERVICES, IS SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE MERCHANT.

IF YOU REQUIRE A REFUND OR REVERSAL OF ANY TRANSACTION COMPLETED USING THE VISA SOLUTION, YOU MUST CONTACT THE APPLICABLE MERCHANT AND/OR THE ISSUER OF THE ELIGIBLE CARD YOU USED FOR THE TRANSACTION. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT VISA IS NOT A PARTY TO THE TRANSACTION, AND THUS VISA IS NOT ABLE TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH ISSUES THAT YOU MAY HAVE WITH THE TRANSACTION.

IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH A MERCHANT ABOUT A TRANSACTION MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE VISA SOLUTION, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTLING THE DISPUTE DIRECTLY WITH THE MERCHANT OR VIA YOUR ISSUER. DUE TO HOW THE VISA SOLUTION FUNCTIONS, VISA IS NOT A PARTY TO THE TRANSACTION.

-----------------------------

If you choose to register in or activate an Eligible Card for the Visa Solution, you agree to provide us with true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and update us if there are changes to the information. To the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, you acknowledge and agree that Visa will have no liability associated with or arising from your failure to maintain accurate information with Visa, including your failure to receive important information and updates about the Visa Solution.

As a part of your registration, you are required to establish a username and in some markets may be required to establish a password. These pieces of data are used to authenticate you when you use the Visa Solution.

You are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your username and password(s), if any. In addition, if you choose to be remembered on your device or browser, or link your use of the Visa Solution with a digital wallet, on one or more device(s), you are responsible for protecting the safety of and access to such device(s). It is important that you do so since we are not responsible for any losses you incur as a result of unauthorized use of your Eligible Card and, depending on the circumstances, your Issuer may hold you responsible for unauthorized use of your Eligible Card account. You agree to notify Visa immediately of any unauthorized use of your username, password, if applicable, or Eligible Card in the Visa Solution, or if your device(s) on which you’ve chosen to be remembered, or linked your use of the Visa Solution with a digital wallet, has been lost or stolen or otherwise suffered unauthorized access, or any other actual or potential security breach relating to your use of the Visa Solution. Visa reserves the right to remove your Eligible Cards from, or suspend or terminate your use of, the Visa Solution and/or, if you have a password, require you to change your password, if Visa believes it is no longer secure.

You are responsible for use of your Eligible Cards in the Visa Solution and for ensuring that use of or access to the Visa Solution complies fully with these Terms.

You acknowledge that Visa may send a one-time passcode to your email and/or mobile phone to verify it's you when you use the Visa Solution.

We regularly review the security measures for the Visa Solution. However, we cannot guarantee that information you transmit via the Internet is entirely secure.

You may choose to use the capabilities on your personal device such as fingerprints, face authentication and/or your device passcode (“Passkeys”) in connection with the Visa Solution, where made available by Visa. Your use of Passkeys is governed by the agreement between you and your device manufacturer. Your fingerprints, face authentication data and/or device passcode do not leave your device. You may choose whether to use Passkeys in connection with any payment transaction, and you may disable your use of Passkeys in connection with the Visa Solution by unlinking your card or removing your device [here](https://secure.checkout.visa.com/createAccount?channel=destination&niflow=destination&nicmp=destination&locale=en-EN&country=EN.html).

You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Visa Solution complies with any Cardholder Agreement.

    You must have a Visa Solution account username to access information electronically or to conduct any activity regarding your Visa Solution account.
2. **Waiver.  
    **Our failure or delay to exercise or enforce any provision or right contained in these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision or right.
3. **Entire Agreement.**  
    These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Visa and you with respect to your use of the Visa Solution.
4. **Severability.**  
    You and Visa agree that if any provision of these Terms is deemed unlawful, void (including by virtue of law) or for any reason unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
5. **Interpretation.**  
    Headings and captions are for convenience only and shall not be considered included for purposes of interpretation. Words such as "hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" shall mean and refer to all these Terms, rather than any particular part of the same. The term "including" shall mean "including, without limitation". Whenever used herein, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular, and the use of any gender shall be applicable to all genders.
6. **Relationship of the Parties.**  
    Nothing in these Terms will be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship between you and Visa, and you do not have any authority to create any obligation or make any representation on Visa's behalf.
7. **Indemnification.**  
    To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Visa Parties from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, damages, fines and costs, due to, in connection with or arising out of your breach of these Terms.
8. **Dispute Resolution & Governing Law.**  
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Visa agree that:

1. if you are a resident of an Eligible Jurisdiction other than those in H (b.) below, the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:  
    **THIS SECTION CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT PROVIDES THAT ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE VISA SOLUTION OR THESE TERMS SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. IN ARBITRATION NEITHER YOU NOR VISA WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT, OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THE CLAIMS. CLAIMS MAY BE ARBITRATED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. PRE-HEARING DISCOVERY RIGHTS AND POST-HEARING APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED, BUT THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS PERMITTED UNDER THESE TERMS.**  
    Any dispute, cause of action, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Visa Solution or these Terms, including the formation, interpretation, breach, performance, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms, the validity and enforcement of this provision, and the determination of the scope or applicability of the agreement to arbitrate (referred to in this section H(a) as a "Dispute") that can be subject to arbitration, shall be resolved exclusively pursuant to the process and arbitration clause set out in this section. Any Disputes between you and Visa shall be resolved through binding arbitration; except that, if you are a U.S. resident, you may assert claims in small claims court (if your claims qualify). This arbitration clause only applies to Disputes with Visa regarding the Visa Solution. If you have a dispute with your Eligible Card Issuer you must resolve that dispute with your Issuer.  
    Any arbitration between you and Visa shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if you reside in the United States and JAMS’ International Arbitration Rules if you reside outside the United States, to the extent that those rules do not conflict with this provision. You may obtain a copy of these rules by contacting JAMS at 1-800-352-5267, by writing to JAMS at 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018 or online at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/) or [www.jamsinternational.com/](https://www.jamsadr.com/global/?tab=overview).  
    **ANY CLAIM SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THIS MEANS THAT BOTH YOU AND VISA ARE PROHIBITED FROM JOINING OR CONSOLIDATING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST OTHERS UNLESS BOTH YOU AND VISA AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, AND YOU AND VISA ARE PROHIBITED FROM ARBITRATING ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND VISA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.** The arbitration will take place before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall (i) be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; and (ii) not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. The arbitrator will be mutually agreed upon by you and Visa. If you and Visa cannot agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be appointed according to JAMS procedures. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and Visa both waive any right to a jury trial.  
    You may elect to hire an attorney, but are not required to do so. Each party will be responsible for its own attorney fees and costs, unless awarded by the arbitrator under applicable law. The party that initiates the arbitration will pay the filing fee (unless otherwise dictated by JAMS due to a finding of hardship). Visa will advance all other administration, case management and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, through payment directly to JAMS. At the end of the arbitration, the fees paid by Visa may be allocated between you and Visa at the direction of the arbitrator in compliance with JAMS procedures.  
    All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision. Any decision of the arbitrator shall be final. Judgement on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Visa’s liability is limited as described in Section 13 above, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  
    These Terms and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.  
    If the arbitration provision in this section is found to be unenforceable, or the waiver of class action rights is found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made, then the governing law and forum selection provisions described in H (b.) below shall apply.  
    The remainder of this section applies to U.S. residents:  
    The arbitrator cannot award punitive or exemplary damages, except as may be required by statute, or any pre-award interest; nor may the arbitrator award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits or harm suffered by third parties. Any relief afforded cannot affect other Visa Solution users. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the Terms and this section shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).
2.  if you are a resident of (i) **Argentina**, **Brazil, Canada** or an Eligible Jurisdiction in **Europe**, (ii) any Eligible Jurisdiction in which the arbitration provision in paragraph H (a) above is found to be unenforceable, or (iii) any other Eligible Jurisdiction where the waiver of class action rights is found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made, then the following shall apply: (x) any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Visa Solution will be governed by and construed under the laws of the Eligible Jurisdiction of your residence; and (y) any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Visa Solution shall be resolved within the competent civil courts residing within such Eligible Jurisdiction. Any mandatory consumer protection law remains applicable.

10. **Assignment.**  
    You may not assign these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Visa's prior written consent. Visa reserves the right to assign these Terms, and the rights and obligations hereunder, to any third party without notice to or consent from you. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against you and your respective successors and assigns. You may terminate your use of the Visa Solution at any time, including if you are not happy with our assignment of these Terms.
11. **Country Specific Provisions.

ii) public authorities, courts, European Union courts or institutions imposing upon Visa obligations that have a direct impact on the contents of these Terms; this would not, however, concern any change of the provisions that are unfair for consumers under Article 385(1) § 1 of the Act of April 23, 1964. - Civil Code;

iii) to introduce new, additional functionality to the Visa Solution;

iv) to make technical enhancements to the functioning of the Visa Solution; and/or

In case of a change to the Terms under this section, Visa will only add, delete, or amend the relevant provisions of the Terms in connection with the reason that served as the basis for change, and only to the extent necessary to introduce the proposed change.

Visa will provide you thirty (30) days’ prior notice by email of upcoming changes. The notification will state the reason and grounds for introducing the change. If you do not accept the changes, you will have the right to terminate your use of the Visa Solution at any time.

Apart from the changes indicated in the paragraph above, Visa may change and/or modify any aspect of the Visa Solution and/or these Terms, temporarily or permanently, including the availability of any portion of the Visa Solution with your express consent by providing you with a minimum of thirty (30) days’ notice prior to carrying out the above activity. In such notification message, Visa will indicate the scope of the proposed changes, the date of their implementation and the request for you to agree to them. If you do not agree to such change and/or modification, Visa will terminate your use of the Visa Solution.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set out in these Terms, Visa may suspend, discontinue or terminate your access to or use of the Visa Solution at any time, immediately if you violate section 12 of these Terms (“User Conduct”). Visa will inform you of the suspension, discontinuance, or termination of your use of or access to the Visa Solution and in such a notice Visa will state the reasons thereof. Upon termination, you remain liable for all payments and other obligations you have incurred under these Terms.
