d. Agency/Buying Service means any Person who purchases the placement of any Advertisement on behalf of an Advertiser for placement on the Property(ies).

e. Client means the Advertiser and, if applicable, any Agency/Buying Service engaged by Advertiser, jointly and severally.

f. Client Licensed Data means the data, information and materials provided by Client to Nexstar, specifically excluding the Advertisements, that contains personal information (as defined in Section 14) for purposes as set out in the Order.

g. Contract means any Order and these Terms.

h. Data Insights means Nexstar’s products (i) combining Site Data with Nexstar Data for attribution and attribution reporting, and/or (ii) combining Site Data, Nexstar Data and third party anonymized and aggregated data in order to create predictive audience targeting recommendations, as ordered by the Client set out in the Order.

i. Managed Services means certain advertising services provided by Nexstar to Client as set out in the Order to facilitate the display of Advertisements on the Properties, including without limitation, social media campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing, email marketing, Data Insights, reporting keyword campaigns, media buying services and advertising design and creative services.

j. Nexstar Data means (i) all data generated by or gathered from the Properties pursuant to an Order, and (ii) all third party data sources used by Nexstar pursuant to an Order, excluding the Site Data.

k. Order means each and every proposal, order, confirmation, invoice or other ordering document between Nexstar and Client.

q. Site Data means the website visitor data collected by Nexstar by placing a pixel on Client’s website as part of Data Insights.

r. Station means any television station owned by Nexstar or one of its subsidiaries.

2\. Contract.
-------------

The Order and these Terms represent the entire contract (“Contract”) between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, contracts and understandings between the parties, both oral and written. Any amendment to these Terms must be in writing and signed by Nexstar. The terms of this Contract apply to the parties hereto and all of their successors or assigns.  If there is any conflict between the terms of the Order and these Terms, the terms of the Order will apply.  If any part of the Contract is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such term shall be excluded from the Contract and the remainder of the Contract will remain enforceable and in effect.

3\. Order and Payment.
----------------------

Nexstar reserves the right to increase or change the rates in any Order at any time for any Advertisement subject to demand and availability. In the event Nexstar provides notice of any rate change, Client may terminate this Contract within ten (10) days of receipt of such notice. Nexstar will bill Client monthly unless otherwise stated in the Order. The Order invoice shall include the charges to Client for placement of the Advertisement on the Property(ies). Client must dispute any invoice in writing within 10 days of receipt, and any failure to do so within such 10-day period shall be deemed a waiver by Client of any claim relating to such disputed invoice. Advertiser and Advertiser’s Agency/Buying Service, jointly and severally, are obligated to pay Nexstar in full within 30 days after receipt without any deduction or right of set-off. Payment by Advertiser to Advertiser’s Agency/Buying Service does not constitute payment to Nexstar, and failure of Advertiser’s Agency/Buying Service to receive funds from Advertiser does not relieve such Agency/Buying Service of its obligations to timely make all payments due. Failure to pay in accordance with these terms will result in a monthly service charge of 1.5% (or the maximum amount permitted by law) on all unpaid balances not received within 30 days from receipt of invoice. Nexstar may terminate any Order if payment of any prior Order has not been timely made. Nexstar, in its sole discretion, may require payment in full in advance for any Order; provided all Advertisements for political matters will require payment in full in advance. Any failure by Client to make payment when due shall render Client liable for all reasonable fees (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Nexstar for the collection of all amounts due and owing by Client.

4\. Placement.
--------------

Nexstar will provide Client with the use of commercial inventory on its specified Properties as mutually agreed in the Order to which these Terms are attached. Nexstar will have sole determination of the placement of all Advertisements within a Program or Page. Placements are not guaranteed. Nexstar specifically disclaims (i) any obligation to place Client’s Advertisement at a specific time or place, unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing in the Order, (ii) the scheduling of such Advertisement near competitive products and like advertisers, unless specifically agreed otherwise in writing in the Order and (iii) any overlays appearing on the Advertisement (e.g., EAS notifications, viewer tools, information and actions that a viewer or third party may activate, and the like). Nexstar does not guarantee ratings for any Advertisement unless specifically set forth in the Order and shall have no obligation to provide Client with ratings information. Client agrees that placement of any Advertisement in any Program will result in such Advertisement being displayed via multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), virtual (OTT) MVPDs, video-on-demand, mobile applications and all other platforms on which the Program is broadcast.

5\. Television Inventory Preemptions.
-------------------------------------

From time-to-time, preemptions of advertising may occur in any Program or on any Station for any reason. Client agrees that Nexstar may replace any preempted Advertisement with a “Makegood” in similar inventory. Nexstar’s rate cards (which are subject to change) and date of order entry will be the sole determinant of inventory clearance and preemption status (e.g., a grid 5 advertisement entered on May 5 will clear before a grid 5 advertisement entered on May 10; a grid 4 advertisement regardless of date of entry will clear before all grid 5 advertisements, etc.) In the event Nexstar is unable to provide a Makegood, Nexstar may provide a credit not to exceed the amount paid by Client for such preempted Advertisement. Such credit shall be Client’s sole remedy for any preemption not made good.

6\. Program Substitutions.
--------------------------

Nexstar makes no representations or guarantees regarding any Program. In the event Client purchased a specific Program, Nexstar may substitute another Program for any Program purchased by Client if such original Program is no longer available. Any such replacement Program will be of comparable quality with comparable demographics (as determined by Nexstar in its sole discretion) and/or in the same time period and day as originally ordered.

7\. Digital Impressions.
------------------------

In the event a digital Order guarantees delivery of a certain number of impressions, Nexstar will use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) deliver the impressions in accordance with the delivery obligations set forth in the Order and (ii) deliver the impressions starting with the start date and ending with the end date set forth in the Order. Because the estimates are forecasts, Nexstar makes no guarantee regarding the levels of impressions for any individual Advertisement. Unless otherwise provided in the digital Order, (i) Nexstar will maintain impression delivery statistics and Advertiser acknowledges that impression delivery statistics provided by, or on behalf of, Nexstar are the official and definitive measurements of Nexstar’s performance on any impression delivery obligations provided in an Order, and (ii) no other measurements or usage statistics (including those of Advertiser or any third party) shall be accepted by Nexstar or have any effect on an Order. In the event the impression obligation set forth in an Order is reached prior to the end of the term of an Order, Nexstar may cease distribution of the Advertisement. The impression obligation will be deemed reached if at least 90% of the impressions are delivered, unless otherwise specified in the Order. If there is a shortfall in delivery of impressions of more than 10% at the end of any specified period, Nexstar may provide, as Advertiser’s sole remedy, “Makegood” impressions in the same or a comparable manner or class of time, or alternatively Nexstar may provide a credit.

8\. Order Errors and Changes.
-----------------------------

Unless errors in the Order are brought to Nexstar’s attention within three (3) business days of acceptance, the Contract is deemed accepted as written. No verbal cancellation or changes to this Contract are permitted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Client may request revisions to the Publication Dates and/or substitute new creative no later than two weeks prior to each such Advertisement’s Publication Date. No further changes will be accepted after such date unless otherwise agreed upon between the parties in writing (email shall suffice).

9\. Advertisement Standards.
----------------------------

All Advertisements furnished by Client must conform to Nexstar’s standards as well as any advertising and technical guidelines provided by Nexstar to Advertiser. Client represents and warrants that all Advertisements furnished to Nexstar under this Contract (i) will comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and industry standards, (ii) will contain proper sponsorship identification under the Communications Act and FCC rules, (iii) will comply with applicable rules and policies of the Federal Trade Commission and any other government agencies having jurisdiction, (iv) will be truthful, (iv) will not include any Harmful Code or persistent tracking; (v) will not promote any content that is defamatory, false, misleading or offensive; (vi) will maintain and adhere to Advertiser’s privacy policy, which will abide by applicable laws and shall include appropriate notices, disclosures and opt out means in connection with the party’s collection, sharing, use and storage of data related to end users, their computing or mobile devices, and/or their interactions with the advertising materials; and (vii) comply with all applicable best industry standards in connection with the advertising materials, including but not limited to, those set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance, Interactive Advertising Bureau, Network Advertising Initiative, mobile app store providers and other industry standard third parties, organizations or guidelines including the most recent iOS operating system and Google Play disclosures. “Harmful Code” means content or other material that contains software viruses, worms, Trojan horses, time bombs, cancelbots, or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents, programs, or programming routines. Client agrees to furnish advertising substantiation material to Nexstar promptly upon request.

10\. Delivery/Right of Rejection.
---------------------------------

Client is responsible for timely furnishing, at Client’s sole cost and expense, all Advertisements to Nexstar by the deadline established. Nexstar shall not be liable for its inability to deliver or place any Advertisement not timely received and Client will remain liable for payment of the reserved placement. Nexstar has the right to reject any Advertisement in its sole discretion. Nexstar will attempt to timely notify Client of such rejection. In the event Nexstar provides a notice of rejection to Client of any Advertisement, Client is solely responsible for timely providing new creative to Nexstar. If Client fails to timely furnish an appropriate new Advertisement, Nexstar, in its sole discretion, may schedule promotional or public service announcements in place of Client’s rejected Advertisement with a courtesy identification to Advertiser. No action by Nexstar under this paragraph will relieve Client of its obligations to make all payments provided for in the Order.

11\. Intellectual Property Rights.
----------------------------------

Client hereby represents and warrants that Advertiser owns, controls or has obtained all intellectual property rights (including all copyrights and music licensing rights and payments therefore) in and to all Advertisements placed under this Contract and hereby grants Nexstar, without charge, the rights necessary to use all such Advertisement on any Nexstar Property set forth in this Contract. Client further confirm that Nexstar’s use of the Advertisement will not and does not infringe upon the rights of any Person. Client hereby grants to Nexstar a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty free right to distribute, reproduce, copy, reformat, digitize, cut, adapt, compress, transcode, display, perform and technologically manipulate an Advertisement in all cases as reasonably necessary to distribute the Advertisement, or to comply with any applicable federal, state or local law, regulation or court order. Each Party owns and retains all right, title and interest in and to all of its intellectual property, and no rights are granted to the other Party’s intellectual property except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

12\. Managed Services.
----------------------

In providing the Managed Services, Advertiser may grant Nexstar access to certain Advertiser’s Accounts. Nexstar shall access the Accounts to provide the Managed Services to Client and for no other reason. Nexstar shall treat the Accounts, including the login or access credentials information to the Accounts, as Advertiser’s confidential information.

13\. Site Data.
---------------

If ordered by Client as part of an Order, Nexstar may collect Site Data to provide Data Insights or to provide the Services set out in the IO. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in collecting Site Data, Nexstar shall act as the Service Provider/Data Processor as defined under applicable data protection legislation as it relates to the processing of any personally identifiable information (“PII”) as defined by applicable data protection legislation. Client represents and warrants that Advertiser has provided all notices and obtained all consents required under applicable law to permit Nexstar to provide the Services and use the PII as set out herein. Nexstar represents and warrants that, as it relates to Site Data, including PII, it shall: (i) not retain, use or disclose such data for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of providing the Data Insights or other Services to Client as set out herein; (ii) it shall not use such data for Nexstar’s own commercial purposes except in the case where such data is aggregated and anonymized so that Client and any PII cannot be identified; (iii) shall provide Client with all reasonable assistance in relation to individuals exercising their rights under applicable data protection laws; (iv) shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures taking into account state of the art, designed to protect against the unauthorized or unlawful access, use, disclosure or other processing of the PII; (v) promptly delete the Site Data at the end of the Term. Nexstar certifies that it understands its obligations and restrictions set out in this Section 13 and will comply with them.

14\. Client Licensed Data.
--------------------------

If Client makes Client Licensed Data available to Nexstar in order to provide Services set out in an Order, Client grants Nexstar and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, royalty free, license to use, reproduce, distribute copies, modify and prepare derivative works of the Client Licensed Data, solely to perform the Services as set out in the Order. Ownership of the Licensed Data shall remain with Client. If any Client Licensed Data includes data that would be considered “personal information” under applicable data protection laws, including without limitation the California Consumer Privacy Act 2018, including all regulations and guidelines, (collectively, “Privacy Laws”), Client represents that appropriate notice was given and consent was received from the data subjects for it to make available the Client Licensed Data to Nexstar to perform the Services. Client represents that it provides data subjects with the opportunity to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information. Client shall not make available any personal information from any data subject that has opted-out of the sale or sharing of its personal information. In providing the Services, Nexstar shall: (a) not sell, retain, use, share, or disclose (collectively, “Use”) personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services pursuant to the Order; (b) not Use personal information for its own commercial purposes; (c) provide Client with all reasonable assistance in relation to individuals exercising their rights under applicable Privacy Laws; (d) maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect against the unauthorized or unlawful access, use, disclosure or other processing of personal information; (e) promptly delete a personal information upon request by Client, or at the end of the Term, whichever is earlier, provided that Nexstar may retain such data for its internal purposes once anonymized and aggregated; (f) comply with all Privacy Laws and notify Client if it (i) can no longer meet its obligations, or (ii) becomes aware of a breach or potential breach of the personal information; (g) not engage any sub-processors to provide any part of the services without a contract with such sub-processors, either directly or indirectly, with similar requirements as set out in this Section 14; and (h) allow, upon reasonable notice, Client to review Nexstar’s compliance with this Agreement and take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate the unauthorized use of personal information. Client and Nexstar shall comply with Privacy Laws.

15\. Confidentiality/Subpoenas.
-------------------------------

Neither party is authorized to share details of this Contract, including without limitation specific advertising rates, proposals, insertion orders, and targeting information, or any other non-public information relating to the other party obtained by virtue of this Contract, without express written consent of the other party. Client acknowledges and agrees that as between the parties, the personal data and any other data originating from the Properties belongs to Nexstar and is Nexstar’s confidential information and shall not be shared by Client with to any third party. Client hereby consents to (i) Nexstar sharing information about this Contract with any other Property owners, (ii) Nexstar’s vendors who need to know the information for performance of the Contract, and (iii) Nexstar’s production to any and all third parties pursuant to a subpoena or as otherwise required by applicable law.

All Nexstar Data shall be owned by the Nexstar and, without Nexstar’s written consent, Client may not use such data and Nexstar shall have no obligation to provide such data to Client. If for any reason Nexstar does provide Client with such Nexstar Data, such data shall constitute Confidential Information. In addition, Client shall not (i) combine any Nexstar Data received by it from Nexstar with any other data or information; (ii) use such Nexstar Data for any purpose other than the evaluation of Client’s advertising campaign; (iii) re-identify or attempt to re-identify an individual; or (iv) use such data for a discriminatory purpose or in a manner contrary to law. Client further agrees it will not include in its Advertisement flash cookies, HTML5 databases, local shared objector or any other technology used for tracking end user behavior or information in any manner that: (i) that stores files, code or data (collectively, “Tracking Data”) on an end user’s computing or mobile device in such a manner that such Tracking Data cannot be easily and readily deleted by the end user via customary means (e.g., web browser and mobile device options menus) or (ii) that, without the end user’s knowledge, restores such Tracking Data after intentional deletion by the end user. Except as authorized by Nexstar in writing, Client shall not collect from mobile user devices any unique device identifiers, carrier ID numbers, or MAC addresses, created by and stored on end user devices by device manufacturers, operating system providers, or mobile carriers, which uniquely identify such devices or end users.
