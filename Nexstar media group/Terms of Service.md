We reserve the right to change or discontinue at any time any aspect or feature of the Properties without notice to you. Additionally, we reserve the right to change these Terms of Use or to impose new conditions on use of the Properties from time to time, in which case we will post the revised Terms of Use on the Properties. Any modifications are effective immediately upon posting. By continuing to use the Properties after we post any such changes, you accept the modified Terms of Use.

**PERSONAL AND NONCOMMERCIAL USE**The Properties are for your personal and noncommercial use only, unless otherwise permitted by us. The Properties are not designed for or marketed to children under age thirteen. As a condition of your continued use of the Properties, you warrant to us that you will not use the Properties for any purpose that is prohibited by these Terms of Use or by applicable international, federal, state, or local laws, and that you are at least thirteen years of age.

**PROHIBITED CONDUCT/ACTIVITY**It is a condition of your use of the Properties that you do not:

**THIRD PARTY WEBSITES**The Properties may contain hyperlinks to websites offered by third parties. Such hyperlinks are provided for your convenience only. We are not responsible for the content of any such website and our inclusion of hyperlinks to such websites does not imply any endorsement or sponsorship by us of the material on such websites or any association with their operators.

**LINKING**Unless you are subsequently advised otherwise by us, you are hereby licensed to create hyperlinks to the Content on the Properties, provided that the hyperlink accurately describes the Content as it appears on the Properties. We reserve the right to revoke this license generally, or your right to use specific links, at any time. Under no circumstances may you “frame” the Properties or any of their Content or copy portions of the Properties to a server, except as part of an Internet service provider’s incidental caching of pages. Each page within the Properties must be displayed in full (including all trademarks, branding, advertising and promotional materials), without any accompanying frame, border, margin, design, branding, trademark, advertising or promotional materials not originally displayed on the page within the Properties.

**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**The Properties and all the Content available on the Properties are the property of us or our licensors, and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not use the Properties or the Content available on the Properties in a manner that infringes the owner’s rights or that has not been authorized by the owner. Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms of Use, you may not copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, modify, rewrite, create derivative works from, transmit, transfer, sell, exploit, or distribute in any manner or medium (including by email or other electronic means) any Content contained on the Properties without the prior consent of the owner. None of the Content or software contained on the Properties may be reverse-engineered, disassembled, decompiled, transcribed, stored in a retrieval system, translated into any language or computer language, retransmitted in any form or by any means (electronic, mechanical, photo reproduction, recordation or otherwise), resold or redistributed without our prior written consent.

Your use of any software available on or through on the Properties is governed by the end user license agreement, if any, that accompanies or is included with the software. You may not install or use any software without first agreeing to the terms of such end user license agreement. For any software not accompanied by an end user license agreement, we hereby grant to you a limited personal, nontransferable, non-sublicensable license to use the software for viewing and other purposes within the scope of use of such software anticipated by us in accordance with these Terms of Use, and for no other purpose. Any such software is provided to you subject to the warranty and liability exclusions set forth in these Terms of Use.

You may make single copies of Content displayed on the Properties for your personal and noncommercial use only, provided any copies include the copyright and other notices displayed with the Content on the Properties. You may not distribute such copies to others, whether or not for a charge or other consideration, without prior written permission from us or from the owner of the copied material. Requests to reproduce Content on the Properties for distribution or other purposes should be sent to us at the address provided below. You may also embed any videos that we make available on our Properties, provided, however, that you acknowledge and agree that we may remove any such videos at any time, in our sole discretion and without notice to or consent from you, which will render such videos unusable.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that Content or activity on the Properties was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

We do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy or reliability of any User Content or endorse any opinions expressed by such users.

**ANY RELIANCE UPON USER CONTENT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

**INDEMNIFICATION**You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless us, our officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers from and against any and all claims, actions, demands, liens, allegations, damages of every kind and description, encumbrances, losses, costs, expenses, fines, liabilities and settlements, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting fees, resulting from, or alleged to result from: (i) your use of the Properties or any content, product or service offered through the Properties; (ii) your use of any User Content or use by others of User Content submitted by you; or (iii) your infringement or alleged infringement of the copyright, trademark, patent, publicity rights, or other proprietary rights of third parties or your breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by you in these Terms of Use.
