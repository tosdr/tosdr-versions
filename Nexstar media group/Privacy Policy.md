We may also automatically collect information that does not directly identify you but may be considered your personal data under applicable law (“Other Information”). Other Information may include but is not limited to information such as identifiers like your IP address, device ID and cookie ID as well as internet and connecting device information and other information.

Identifiable Information and Other Information shall collectively be referred to as “Personal Information” throughout this Privacy Policy.

3\. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
-----------------------------

#### _Information Provided Directly to Us._ 

Registration, Events, Activities. The Properties provide certain activities in which we gather Personal Information from users of the Properties, such as an activity that requires that a user complete a registration process and receive/select a “user name” and password. Registration to participate activities promoted on the Properties may require the submission of your mobile number, email address, zip code, date of birth and other Personal Information. Personal Information that may be submitted include your password hints, gender, personal interests, industry you work in, occupation/role, household income, communication preferences, preferred news source, and any other information you provide to us in order to use a Property feature or service. If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. If you attend an event hosted or sponsored by us, we may require that you register for that event and provide your name, address, email address, phone number and payment information. We may also request your feedback and other information related to the event.

Alerts and Promotional Communications. In addition, you may have the ability to opt in to additional subscription services, such as email and/or text alerts or promotional and marketing information to be received directly from Us and/or our advertisers and co-sponsors which may require you to provide certain Personal Information.

Testimonials. We may collect Personal Information from the testimonials or posts you may provide. If you submit any testimonials to be posted on our Properties, we will obtain your consent prior to using your name and testimonial. Information Provided by Others. We may also collect Personal Information about you when such information is provided by another individual on your behalf (for example, if another individual submits a birthday notice with your name and email address or submits a photo or video with you in it). For certain activities you may be asked to submit a person’s name, address, phone number and/or email address.

Communications. We may collect information about you when you communicate with us via email, post, our online tools, telephone, or otherwise through our Properties, as well as any communications you post on our social media pages such as Facebook and Twitter.

Photographs. You may provide us with photographs or video materials that contain Personal Information about you and others for use on our Properties.

#### _Information Collected Automatically._

In addition to the information that you may provide to us, our Properties also automatically collect Other Information about you that may include information related to your computer, including your browser type, operating system and computer monitor resolution; your Internet Protocol (IP) address (the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area); sites and/or applications you visited before and after visiting our Properties; web pages and advertisements you view; links you click on our Properties; unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law (we will only collect precise location data with your consent on your first use of the service); information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies; information about your interactions with video content, such as the content viewed; information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and standard server log information.

Cookies and similar technologies: You should be aware that Other Information may be automatically collected on the Properties through the use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies (collectively referred to as a “cookie”). Nexstar uses cookies for delivery and reporting of advertisements; tracking users’ responses to an ad (e.g., click rate and conversions); reviewing the frequency and time of the display of an advertisement; storage of user preferences; saving of your password; and the collection, aggregation and analysis of anonymous tracking data to help measure and track traffic and general user behavior. We may also use cookies to help us offer you more relevant information or products and services of interest to you. Further, to better serve relevant ads to you, we may also assign an identifier (“ID”) to your device, computer, or browser when serving an ad. The ID may be implemented on your computer/device through a cookie. Such method does not enable Nexstar to personally identify you. The ID can be used to attempt to match an assigned user by inference, based on the user’s activities tracked across multiple devices or browsers. Cookies also identify you to our servers allowing you the opportunity to avoid reentering your email and password each time you access the Properties.

Our third-party service providers, advertisers and affiliates may use cookies to manage or measure the performance of their information displayed or delivered over our Properties. For more information regarding this use, please see our Links to Third Party Sites and/or Applications” section below.

We may also use technical methods in our HTML emails that we send to you to determine whether you have opened or forwarded an email and/or clicked on links in those emails, to customize the display of banner advertising and other messages to you, to determine whether you have made an inquiry or purchase in response to a particular email and other similar activities. These technical methods may enable us to collect and use your Personal Information.

#### _Information Obtained from Other Sources._ 

Where permitted by applicable law, we may also obtain Other Information (e.g. demographic information, interests, purchases, etc.) and/or Personal Information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (such as mobile devices, third-party services, and embedded video players), from co-branded partners, advertising related companies, from sites/applications (for example, on our pages on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media), and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases).

You can also engage with our content, such as videos, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and other third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites, plug-ins, and/or applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo(s), gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the “likes” you make) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application or plug-in. We may also obtain Other Information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information regarding advertisements within the content you have been shown and may have clicked on) from your interaction with our content.

When you provide Personal Information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Properties, and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. When you

provide Personal Information to us through an application, on our Properties, or on social networking sites (e.g., in the form of a post or through profile information to be viewed by others), it may be publicly viewed by other members of these sites and/or applications and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties.

Through some social networking sites’ privacy settings, you can control what data you share. For more information about how social networking sites handle your Personal Information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.

#### _Combining Information._ 

Please note that all of the information we collect about you may be combined, to help us tailor our communications, products, services, and advertisements to you and to develop rich online content and services across the Properties.

#### _Wireless Device Information._ 

Unless otherwise provided in a separate registration page, we do not request for marketing purposes, contact information for a mobile phone, text messaging or any wireless device that includes a domain name address (such as “wireless.bellsouth.com”) as part of the contact information. Federal law prohibits the sending of commercial marketing email messages directly to a wireless device that uses a domain name, unless you have first given your affirmative consent. We may inadvertently collect a wireless device number that includes a domain name when you send us an inquiry or register for a contest/sweepstakes or membership club. However, we will not knowingly use that contact information for sending commercial marketing email. We reserve the right to respond to user inquiries or requests sent via a wireless device that uses a domain name, as such messages are not deemed to be commercial marketing email.

We may require verification of your identity to action your request and such verification required may vary depending on the information you are requesting. Your Privacy Rights are subject to restrictions and exceptions as set out in the Privacy Laws and if such exceptions or restrictions apply to your request, we will explain that to you. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.

You may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf. To do so, we will require either: (i) a valid power of attorney; or (ii) a signed written permission from you. If your authorized agent is relying on a signed written permission from you, we may also need to verify your identity and/or contact directly to confirm permission to proceed with the request.

If you exercise any of your rights and are not satisfied with how we handled your request, you can ask for a review of your request and our response by emailing us at: [PrivacyAdministrator@nexstar.tv](mailto:privacyadministrator@nexstar.tv).

Retention. We will retain your information only for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, to provide you with the services, to comply with our legal obligations and for our own internal business purposes.

CCPA Metrics. CCPA Regulations require us to disclose metrics for the previous calendar year regarding certain requests by California residents exercising their rights under the CCPA. The metrics for our Properties governed by this Privacy Policy are as follows:

| Privacy Requests | Access | Correct | Delete | Limit Use | Do Not Sell |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Received | 12  | 5   | 100 | N/A | 2,012,678 |
| Complied With | 12  | 5   | 100 | N/A | 2,012,678 |
| Unverified/Denied | 0   | 0   | 0   | N/A | 0   |
| Average Days to Respond | 6   | 6   | 6   | N/A | 1   |

\* Please note that where the values are N/A it may mean that the right is not made available as it isn’t applicable to our use or non-use of your Sensitive Personal Information. For example, you may have opted-in to allow our weather apps to collect precise geolocation information. In this case, we will not use your Sensitive Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide that app to you. Therefore, the right to limit the use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information is not applicable as we are already limiting our use and disclosure.

Further, once a year and free of charge, to request information about certain types of Personal Information (if any) that a business has disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year. However, under the law, we are not required to provide this information as long as we: (1) notify you that you have the right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information, and (2) provide you with a cost-free means to exercise that right.

CA Eraser Law. Additionally, if you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any Property where this Privacy Policy is posted, you may request and potentially obtain removal of content or Personal Information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to [caleraser@nexstar.tv](mailto:caleraser@nexstar.tv). All requests must provide: (a) a detailed description of the specific content or Personal Information you want removed; (b) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the content or Personal Information, including but not limited to the name and URL (if applicable) of the Property where such information is located; and (c) your registered username and contact information reasonably sufficient to contact you if we have questions. We shall not accept requests via postal mail, telephone, or facsimile. We are not responsible for requests that are not properly sent and may not be able to respond or take appropriate action if you do not provide complete information. Please also note that requests for removal do not ensure removal of the content or Personal Information you have posted, and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow for removal even if requested.

Non-US visitors. Our Properties are intended for US audiences only. If you are visiting our Properties from outside the United States, our content may be blocked or it may be available for you to view, however, you will not get the same experience as our US users as a result of our restricted data processing.

10\. SECURITY OF INFORMATION
----------------------------

We take reasonable security precautions to secure the Personal Information that you choose to provide against the loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized access of such information. Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information that you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.

We do not and will not ever request your login information, password or credit card information in an unsecured or unsolicited email or telephone communication. This practice is commonly known as “phishing.” For more information about “phishing” and protecting your Personal Information from identity theft, you may want to visit the Federal Trade Commission at [www.ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/).

11\. OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
-----------------------------------------

Our Properties are intended for a general audience and we do not knowingly collect or store Personal Information about children under the age of 13. We may ask for a birth date to ensure that we are not collecting Personal Information from children under 13 or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken in connection with Personal Information collected from children under 18. In those instances where we have actual knowledge that we are collecting Personal Information from children or the Properties offer a service directed toward children, we will comply with applicable laws.

12\. APPLICABLE LAW
-------------------

We control and operate our Properties from the United States. The Properties are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Please note that we do not represent or warrant that the Properties are appropriate for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Properties do so at their own initiative and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Further by using and participating in our Properties or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, access and processing of your information in and/or outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside.
