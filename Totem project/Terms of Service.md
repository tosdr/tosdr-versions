About
-----

Totem is designed as an educational resource for communities learning about digital security. It is an initiative of Greenhost and Free Press Unlimited. The Totem platform provides a way for content contributors and community users to continuously interact and exchange knowledge throughout the learning process.

#### The goals of the platform are

* To improve basic understanding of digital security and related tools for journalists, activists and human rights defenders by creating a safe online classroom environment.
* To build a safe MOOC based on existing open source software (Open edX) that is co-developed with and usable for digital training organisations, individual trainers and students.
* To be sustainable through collaboration to ensure the availability of the platform once the initial stage of the project is completed.

#### Greenhost and Free Press Unlimited

Totem is built on Open edX, an open source educational platform started by edX, an initiative of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) together with the xConsortium. Greenhost and Free Press Unlimited provide Totem as an open source platform in order to ensure the sustainability of this resource, welcoming contributors and communities well beyond the start of the project.

#### Types of content

Totem platform content is adapted, developed and produced in cooperation with content partner organisations, digital security trainers, and communities. Totem hosts three kinds of content:

1. Original content developed for Totem by Greenhost and Free Press Unlimited, which is available to all Totem users
2. Content created by content contributors, which is also available to all Totem users
3. Community content created by course instructors, which is only available to those participating in the course.

#### Content standards

* Original Totem content developed by Greenhost and Free Press Unlimited, together with content partner organisations, is vetted by an advisory board to ensure that it meets content standards or conforms to a set of quality guidelines
* Community content is the responsibility of course instructors. It can be flagged by users of the platform who want to provide feedback or express a concern over its quality
* Original and community content has a timestamp to indicate the date it was last updated in order to help contextualise and verify the accuracy of the materials presented.

#### Licensing

All content on Totem is licensed under a [creative commons attribution share-alike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). This licensing scheme provides autonomy and control to community content contributors while also encouraging collaboration and avoiding the duplication of existing resources.
