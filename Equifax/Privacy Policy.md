**Professional or employment-related information.** Information regarding your employment status, history, and compensation. This is typically provided by your employer or its payroll provider as a result of Equifax providing a Workforce Solutions service to your employer, or otherwise collected through an Equifax affiliate's capacity as a credit reporting agency under the FCRA. Please read the [Equifax Workforce Solutions](#WorkforceSolutions) section for more information.

#### Sources of Personal Data

We collect personal data from the following sources:

**Directly from you.** We collect personal data through our interactions with you, such as when you contact customer support or interact with our social media accounts. We also collect personal data from you through our products, such as when you register to create an account. Some of this information is collected about your interactions, use, and experience with our products and communications.

**Devices and browsers.** We collect personal data through browsers and devices that interact with our websites, online services, and mobile applications.

**Employers.** Companies provide us with personal data about their employees, including prospective and former employees. We usually receive this information as part of providing services to our Workforce Solutions customers. Employment and compensation information is sometimes provided by your employer's payroll provider on your employer's behalf. Please read the [Equifax Workforce Solutions](#WorkforceSolutions) section for more information. We also receive this information when employers provide or purchase our products as a benefit to their employees.

**Financial institutions.** We collect personal data from companies that offer financial products or services to consumers, like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance. This includes banks, mortgage lenders, loan brokers, some financial or investment advisors, insurance companies, and debt collectors.

**Consumer credit customers.** We collect personal data from businesses you permit to access your consumer credit report information in connection with a transaction between you and the business. For example, this includes retail businesses that offer branded credit cards, car dealerships that arrange or facilitate financing for your car purchase or lease, property managers that evaluate your lease application, utility and telecommunications providers, and third-party businesses that offer you access to the information in your Equifax consumer credit report as part of a product or service.

**Third-party data providers.** We purchase personal data from third-party companies that collect and aggregate personal data. Data resellers collect personal data from a variety of sources, including directly from consumers, through devices and browsers, public records, news sources, and from other businesses and data brokers.

**Business customers.** Our business customers provide us with personal data when we provide them with our products and services. For example, a business customer may provide us with its customer list so that Equifax can help manage its accounts through our identity resolution services, or provide information to supplement the customer list for marketing purposes. In most instances, Equifax is limited in using the personal data provided by the business customer to provide the product or service requested by the business customer.

**Government agencies and contractors.** Federal, state, and local government agencies and contractors provide us with personal data. We receive personal data from government agencies in our role as a service provider for government agencies, when providing compliance solutions for our Workforce Solutions customers, in our affiliates' role as a consumer reporting agency, and when we receive information used for compliance purposes such as government-maintained sanctions lists.

**Public records.** We collect personal data which is sourced from public records made available by federal, state, and local governments. This includes information on real property title, lien, ownership and sales history, tax assessments, secretary of state filings, court filings, and federally provided sanctions lists.

#### How We Use Personal Data

We also share personal data for the following reasons:

**Disclosure for legal reasons or as necessary to protect Equifax, its affiliates and others**. We may release personal data to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, court order, or other legal process; (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, a threat to homeland security, a threat to our system or network; or (3) cases in which we believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate or prevent harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal conduct.

**Changes in our corporate structure**. If all or part of our company is sold or merged, if we make a sale or transfer of assets, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we may transfer your information, including your personal data, to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.

#### Commercial Purposes

We use and sell personal data to nonaffiliated third parties for the following commercial purposes:

**Consumer credit reporting.** Some of our affiliates collect, use, and sell personal data when acting as a consumer reporting agency, as this activity is regulated by the FCRA.

**Commercial credit reporting.** We collect, use, and sell personal data as part of our commercial credit reporting services. These services permit our customers to make informed decisions regarding providing credit to or investing in businesses. Commercial credit reports may contain the names and other personal data of owners, principals, guarantors, or agents of the businesses.

**Workforce Solutions.** We collect, use, and sell personal data as part of the Workforce Solutions that we provide to our employer customers.

These services help us and our customers prevent security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and prosecute those responsible for that activity, as well as more accurately manage the account information of their customers.

**Regulatory compliance.** We collect, use, and sell personal data as part of our regulatory compliance products, which help customers comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations.

The entity maintaining this website is a data broker under Texas law. To conduct business in Texas, a data broker must register with the Texas Secretary of State (Texas SOS). Information about data broker registrants is available on the Texas SOS website.

In cases where we have data that cannot be reasonably linked to, or used to infer information about you (i.e., de-identified data), we are committed to maintaining and using the information in a de-identified form and not attempting to re-identify the information, except in an effort to confirm the efficacy of the de-identification process.

#### Equifax Workforce Solutions

Through its Equifax Workforce Solutions ("EWS") products, an affiliate of Equifax collects employee personal data from employers and their employees. EWS's employment verification products use employer-provided information to offer income and employment verification services, which automates the process of employers responding to employment and income verification requests from third parties such as lenders and banks. The collection, use, and sharing of personal data for this purpose is regulated by the FCRA.

EWS also offers products which allow employers to outsource and automate the performance of certain payroll-related and human resource management business processes, including unemployment claims management, tax credits and incentives, I-9 and W-2 form management services, immigration case management, and services which assist with Affordable Care Act compliance. Employers and employees provide employee personal data to Equifax through these EWS products.

As part of providing EWS services, Equifax and its affiliates agree to only use personal data collected through EWS products for the purpose of providing the EWS services, and not for other purposes such as marketing. This applies to employee personal data provided to Equifax by an employer and personal data provided to Equifax by an employee through interacting with an EWS product.

In some instances, when permitted by its clients, EWS uses deidentified employee data to perform analytics, modeling and/or demographic studies. This deidentified employee data does not include any information that individually, or collectively, could be used to identify either the employer or individual employees.

#### Notice of Collection, Storage, Use and Destruction of Biometric Information

Equifax Information Services LLC partners with Mitek Systems Inc., Private Identity LLC, and Acuant Inc. to offer products through which Equifax, other businesses, and government agencies allow you to verify your identity by submitting photos of yourself and your photo identification. If you utilize one of these products, Equifax Information Services LLC, its partners Mitek Systems Inc., Private Identity LLC, Acuant Inc., and the other business or government agency with which you initiate the transaction (the "Parties"), may collect, capture, transmit, store, maintain, use, and otherwise process information about face geometry and related biometric information derived from the photos and other information (including information from your driver's license/passport) that you submit to us for the purpose of providing identity-verification services.

The Parties may use this information from the time of your submission of the information to us, and for the duration of the period that we need to retain the information for identity-verification purposes. We will promptly destroy all biometric information after the completion of our verification process, in no case longer than 13 months after your submission of the information to us.

When you consent to the collection and use of this information, you acknowledge and agree that the Parties may share biometric information with other service providers for use in the verification services. Otherwise, we will not disclose face geometry or other biometric information to third parties without first obtaining additional consent.

Your consent to this Notice of Collection, Storage, use and Destruction of Biometric Information prior to submitting the photos signifies your written release to us to collect, store, use, and eventually destroy the face geometry and other biometric information that we may derive from the information that you submit to us.;

#### Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technology

#### Cookies

We use session and persistent cookie technology. Cookies are text files saved by a device's browser that stores information. That information is available to us later when the browser returns to one of our websites.

#### Web Beacons

We use web beacons to tell us when a person views a web page, opens a video or reads their email. Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on webpages, videos, and in emails.

#### Other Local Storage

We use other kinds of local device storage in connection with the use of our services. These technologies are similar to cookies in that they are stored on devices. Local storage allows us to monitor people's activities on our services and store their preferences.

#### Measurement Code

We use code on our websites to estimate financial and other attributes of our visitors. This is done by correlating the IP address of the visitor with a geographic location. We then correlate that with general financial and economic information about people in that location.

#### Third-party Cookies and Tracking Technology

Our partners use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies for similar purposes. We have agreements with companies, sometimes called "Ad Networks," that serve advertising on behalf of other companies. These Ad Networks may place or recognize a cookie, called a "third party cookie," on a visitor's computer when they visit a website not affiliated with us that has a contract with them. Ad Networks use cookies to understand web usage patterns of people who see advertisements, to control the sequence of advertisements they see, to provide them with the most relevant advertising, and to make sure they don't see the same ad too many times. Ad Networks may connect information about pages visited on our site with information about pages visited on other sites. They show advertising based on this combined information, including advertising for our products.

While we do not control Ad Networks or what they do with the information they collect, we only work with companies that have agreed to participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and/or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), and abide by the associated principles.

#### Analytics Services

Our websites, products, and online advertisements often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These analytics providers are able to set or read their own cookies on your device through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites, and other products. To learn more about controlling information provided to these analytics providers, click on the following links: [Adobe opt-out site](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html), [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

#### Choices and Control over your Information

In general, choices concerning our collection, use and disclosure of information are limited to those provided by law. For details of choices under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, please see our [FCRA Summary of Rights web page](https://www.equifax.com/privacy/fcra/). Beyond those choices, individuals may elect to not provide information directly to us. However, in many cases this will limit our ability to provide services.

#### Opting out of Promotional or Marketing Email

If you do not wish to receive promotional or marketing offers by email, you may opt out of receiving further promotional offers and emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" button in the email. In addition, some Equifax products allow you to manage your communications preferences by logging into your account and managing your account profile. For example, you can manage this preference by logging into my.equifax.com and clicking on "My Account." Note, however, if you are an Equifax customer, you will continue to receive emails from us related to the operation and administration of your account.

#### Opt out of the Sharing of your Personal Data

You can limit the sharing of your personal data among our affiliates to market to you, the sharing of your personal data with non-affiliates to market to you (other than sharing as part of a joint marketing agreement), and the sharing of personal data regarding your creditworthiness among Equifax affiliates for everyday business purposes. To limit the sharing of your personal data, take any of the below actions:

* Visit us online: [https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/).

#### Online Behavioral Advertising

You can opt out of receiving ads based on your online behavior either by visiting the DAA opt-out page at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1), or by clicking on the Ad-Choices icon in or near the ad. If you elect to opt out of online behavioral advertising (OBA), you will still see ads, but they may not be as relevant to you. Please keep in mind that opting out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt out cookie is applied. If you delete your browser cookies or if you use a different computer or different browser and want to continue to be opted out of interest-based advertising, you will need to opt out again. For more information, please read our [Online Behavioral Advertising Notice](https://www.equifax.com/ad-Choices). 

You can learn more about online advertising, including OBA or interest-based advertising, on the DAA website at www.aboutads.info/consumers and on the Network Advertising Initiative web site at [www.networkadvertising.org/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). 

#### Do Not Track

Some browsers transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates. We currently do not take action in response to these signals

[**BACK TO TOP**](#Top)

#### Security

We are committed to protecting the security of your personal data and use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect the personal data we maintain, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. Equifax complies with applicable data protection laws, including security breach notification laws.

#### EU-U.S. and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks

Equifax Inc. and its U.S. subsidiary Kount Inc. (together, "Equifax") comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Equifax has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Equifax adheres to the EU-U.S. DPF Principles for consumer data. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/). 

Personal data collected from you may be stored in the region in which you reside, and depending on the service or data use, Equifax may also store and process your data in other regions where Equifax or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate. Equifax takes steps to process data we collect in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the requirements of applicable law. Your personal data may be shared with third parties to perform services on our behalf. In the context of an onward transfer, Equifax has responsibility for processing personal data it receives under the DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party for external processing. If we transfer personal data received under the DPF to a third party, the third party's access, use, and disclosure of personal data must also be in compliance with our DPF obligations, and we will remain liable under the DPF for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. For information related to the types of data we collect, the purposes for collecting data, the types of third parties we may disclose your data to, and your rights, please refer to the applicable sections of this Privacy Statement. 

If you have a question or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, we encourage you to contact us through our [Privacy Contact Form](https://www.equifax.com/privacy/contactus/) or write to the Chief Privacy Officer, Equifax Inc., 1550 Peachtree Street, NW, Atlanta, GA 30309. Please reference “Data Privacy Framework,” when contacting us about the DPF. For any complaints related to the DPF that Equifax cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant [EU Data Protection Authority](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en), or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and the [UK Information Commissioner’s Office](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/) for resolving disputes with UK individuals. As further explained in the DPF Principles, binding arbitration is available, under certain conditions, to address residual complaints not resolved by other means. Individuals seeking additional information can visit the [DPF Annex I](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction) for more information. Equifax is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and may be required to disclose personal data we handle under the DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
