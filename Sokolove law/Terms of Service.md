We’ve helped people in all 50 states get the legal support they need to move personal injury claims successfully through the court system. Please find our web site's _Terms of Use_ below.

* * *

Terms of Use
============

Thank you for visiting one of the websites of Sokolove Law, LLC and Sokolove Law, LLP. Our websites provide information about the legal services that we offer, provide general information and resources, and allow you to contact us.

All references to “**Firm**,” “**we,”** “ **us**,” or “**our**” refer to Sokolove Law, LLC (which operates as a limited liability company in all states except California, Michigan, Tennessee and Virginia), Sokolove Law, LLP (which operates as a limited liability partnership in California, Michigan, Tennessee and Virginia), and their affiliated and related entities. All references to “ **websites**” include Firm websites that post a link to this Terms of Use (“**Terms**”), including this website, our other Firm-owned and/or operated websites that post these Terms, and websites that post these Terms that are operated for the Firm by service providers under agreement with the Firm.

**Please read these Terms of Use carefully. They are legally binding terms and conditions under which you may access and use the websites. If you do not agree to abide by these Terms, do not use or access the websites.**

These Terms of Use govern your use of our websites, including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions of our websites. By using any one of our websites you accept, and consent to the collection and use of your data in accordance with, our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.sokolovelaw.com/privacy/ "Privacy Policy"). By using our websites, you further agree that we may change, alter, or modify the settings or configurations on your Device (defined in Paragraph 5(C) below) in order to allow for or optimize your use of the websites.

We reserve the right to terminate or limit your access to the websites for any violation of these Terms, or for any other reason, at our sole discretion.

**1. Legal Notices and Disclaimers**

(A) **No Attorney-Client Relationship is Created by Your Use of the Websites.** No attorney-client relationship between you and the Firm is or may be created by your access to or use of the websites or any information contained on them. The only way to become our client is through a mutual agreement in writing. Any information you submit via the websites will not be considered confidential and may be subject to applicable disclosure and reporting requirements, as required by law. If you are interested in asking us to represent you, please call us or otherwise contact us through one of our websites so we can determine whether the matter is one for which we are willing or able to accept professional responsibility. Each website includes a submission form through which you can request that we contact you about our potentially representing you, and each website includes a phone number that you can use to contact us. In addition, please note that attorney ethical rules in certain of the states where our attorneys are licensed require that we provide certain information, so please review our [**Disclaimer**](https://www.sokolovelaw.com/disclaimers/ "Disclaimer") for additional information.

(B) **If You are not a Client Pursuant to a Written Engagement Letter, do not Submit Confidential or Sensitive Information.** If you submit information to us by email or otherwise through one of our websites in connection with a matter for which we do not presently represent you, you acknowledge that it will not be considered to be confidential and consent to our sharing it with other law firms to determine whether we will agree to represent you. We cannot represent you until we know that doing so will not create a conflict-of-interest. Accordingly, please do not send us any information about any matter that may involve you or the matter until you and we enter into an engagement letter or other written agreement stating that we agree to represent you. You recognize that any information that you submit and our review of your information will not preclude any lawyer in our Firm from representing a party directly adverse to you, in any matter where that information is relevant, even if that information is highly confidential and could be used against you and even if it is transmitted in a good faith effort to retain us. We reserve the right to decline any representation, and may be required to decline representation if it would create a conflict of interest with our other clients.

(C) **You Should Not Rely on the Information Contained on the Websites.** The information provided on the websites is general in nature and does not apply to any particular factual, legal, medical, financial, insurance, or other situation. As such, you should not rely on any information on our websites, and should seek professional advice as you determine appropriate. In particular, you should consult personally and directly with:

* an attorney to understand what your legal rights may be in any particular situation;
* appropriate medical, health, counseling, or other professionals for any medical, health, counseling, or other similar advice.  
    For example, if at times you submit an inquiry to a social worker, nurse, or other professional through one of our websites, the response is for your general information only and should not be relied on; and/or
* appropriate financial or insurance professionals for advice related to any financial matters, such as related to any stocks or mutual funds, or insurance matters.

Any opinions expressed may not reflect the opinions of the Firm or any individual attorney. Although we strive to keep the content on the websites relevant and useful, laws are often changing, and we cannot guarantee that all of the content is complete, accurate or current.

**2\. Third Party Sites; Dealings with Third Parties**

(A) **Third-Party Content and Sites.** The websites, including User-Generated Content (defined below), may contain links to third-party sites and ads (collectively, “**Third-Party Sites** ”) that are not owned, controlled or operated by the Firm, including Third-Party Sites operated by advertisers, licensors, licensees, and other third parties such as our service providers or parties who have business relationships with the Firm. The Firm may have no control over the content, operations, policies, terms, or other elements of Third-Party Sites, and the Firm does not assume any obligation to review any Third-Party Sites. The Firm does not endorse, approve, or sponsor any Third-Party Sites, or any third-party content, advertising, information, materials, products, services or other items. Furthermore, the Firm is not responsible for the quality or delivery of the products or services offered, accessed, obtained by or advertised at such Third-Party Sites. Any activities you engage in in connection with any of the same are subject to the privacy and other policies, terms and conditions of use and/or sale, and rules issued by the operator of the Third-Party Sites.

(B) **Dealings with Third Parties.** Any interactions, correspondence, transactions, and other dealings that you have with any third parties found on or through the websites (including on or via Third-Party Sites or advertisements) are solely between you and the third party (including issues related to the content of third-party advertisements, payments, delivery of goods, warranties (including product warranties), privacy and data security, and the like).

**3\. User Accounts**

You may be asked to create an account to access some features of the websites, such as a discussion board. The Firm’s practices governing any resulting collection and use of your personal information are disclosed in our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.sokolovelaw.com/privacy/ "Privacy Policy"). If you are under the age of thirteen (13), then you are not permitted to register as a user or otherwise use the websites or submit personal information to us.

If you register for any feature that requires a password and/or username, then you will select your own password at the time of registration (or we may send you an e-mail notification with a randomly generated initial password) and you agree that you will:

1. You will not use a username (or e-mail address) that is already being used by someone else, may impersonate another person, belongs to another person, violates the intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or is offensive.  
    We may reject the use of any password, username, or e-mail address for any other reason in our sole discretion;
2. You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete registration information about yourself in connection with the registration process and maintain and update such information continuously and promptly to keep it accurate, current, and complete;
3. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, password, and username – whether or not you authorized the activity;
4. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for restricting access to your Device so that others may not access any password protected portion of the websites using your name, username, or password;
5. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, password, or username, or any other breach of security; and
6. You will not sell, transfer, or assign your account or any account rights.

We will not be liable for any loss or damage (of any kind and under any legal theory) to you or any third party arising from your inability or failure for any reason to comply with any of the foregoing obligations.

**4\. Content You Submit and Community Usage Rules**

(A) User Generated Content

1. General. The Firm may now or in the future offer users of the websites the opportunity to create, build, post, upload, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, or otherwise make available on or submit through the websites (collectively, “**submit**”) messages, text, illustrations, files, images, articles, blogs, books, course materials, graphics, photos, comments, responses, sounds, music, audio, videos, information, content, ratings, reviews, data, questions, suggestions, personally identifiable information, or other information or materials and the ideas contained therein (collectively, “**User-Generated Content** ”). Subject to the rights and license you grant in these Terms, you retain whatever legally cognizable right,title, and interest that you have in your User-Generated Content and you remain ultimately responsible for it.

(B) **Community Rules**. As a user of the websites, these Community Rules (“**Community Rules**”) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the websites’ blogs, rating functionality and similar places where you can post comments on the websites (collectively, “**Communities**”).

(i) Nature of Rules.Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:

* Your User-Generated Content. All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms
* No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family. If you choose to submit photos to the websites, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.
* Act Appropriately. All of your activities on the websites must be venue appropriate, as determined by us. Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy. If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn’t belong on the websites. Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited. Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap. Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.
* Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes. Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.
* Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes. Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.
* Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content. Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.
* Others Can See. We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members. However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users. Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, e-mail address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others.
* Don’t Share Other Peoples’ Personal Information. Your User-Generated Content should not reveal another person’s address, phone number, e-mail address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by the Firm.
* Don’t Damage the Websites or Anyone’s Computers or Other Devices. Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the websites or any computer or other Device (as defined in Paragraph 5(C) below).

If you submit User-Generated Content that the Firm reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may discontinue your access to the websites without prior notice to you and take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.

If any provision of these Terms is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms (which will remain in full force and effect). To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter. Wherever the word “including” is used in these Terms, the word will be deemed to mean “including, without limitation”. The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms.

(E) **Communications**. When you communicate with us electronically, such as via e-mail and text message, you consent to receive communications from us electronically. Please note that we are not obligated to respond to inquiries that we receive. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

(F) **Investigations; Cooperation with Law Enforcement; Termination; Survival**. The Firm reserves the right, without any limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of its websites’ security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms,(iii) investigate any information obtained by the Firm in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with criminal laws, (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms, and (vi) discontinue the websites, in whole or in part, or, except as may be expressly set forth in any additional terms, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user Accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third party. Any suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to the Firm under these Terms or any Additional Terms. Upon suspension or termination of your access to the websites, or upon notice from the Firm, all rights granted to you under these Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the websites. The provisions of these Terms, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to the Firm in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.

(G)  **Assignment**. The Firm may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice. These Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of the Firm.

(H) **No Waiver**. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, (i) no failure or delay by you or the Firm in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.

Effective Date: These Terms were last revised on February 17, 2015.
