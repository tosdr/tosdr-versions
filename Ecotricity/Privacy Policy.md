* Your Personal Data will be held on our systems and may be accessed by or transferred to any entity in our corporate group, including any entity that acquires us or that we may acquire.

* Countries outside the UK and European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws which afford adequate protection to individuals’ personal data, and so we limit when we transfer data to them. When data is transferred internationally, we will always take steps to ensure it is afforded an adequate degree of protection by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented;

\- our compliance is required by law;

\- we receive a request from a public authority or law enforcement agency;

### Legal basis for processing personal information

* Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
    
* We will normally collect personal information from you only where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, where we have your consent to do so, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
    
* In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, if we are asked to provide your telephone number or location data to the emergency services in an emergency situation).
    
* If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information)

### Security

* We employ security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. Protection of the registration details and any debit or credit card information you give to us is a major priority. We have implemented a security policy that guards against unauthorised access. Data on our secure pages is encrypted using SSL technology.
    
* Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential, and for letting us know if you think that your password has been compromised.
    
* All your private data will be encrypted at all times whilst in transit over the Internet. SSL is special software that automatically encrypts any data sent by you on our secure pages. Our server then reads the data using a private key. This means that your data, be it debit or credit card information or any other personal details, is turned into code that can only be decoded with the private key or password. All pages on the site that require you to enter personal or sensitive information are secure. Your browser will indicate that the page is secure by displaying a padlock or key in the status bar at the bottom of the window. If your browser is suitably configured, you will receive a warning message when you first access any secure page on the site. This is simply information to advise you that the site is protecting your data.
    
* Although Ecotricity will do its best to protect your personal data, it cannot guarantee the security of any personal data that you disclose online. You must accept the inherent security implications of using the Internet and we will not be responsible for any breach of security unless we have been be in breach of applicable laws and then only to the limits set out in the terms and conditions for the Website.
    
* Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers, affiliates and members of our corporate group. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies/web site terms of use and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check such policies before you submit any personal data to them.
    

### Data Retention

* If you are a Customer, we will retain your information for as long as you continue to use the Services and for a period of 7 years (or as long as the law requires) after your account has closed. We may decide it is necessary to retain your information for longer for the purpose of resolving disputes or payment issues, or because it is still useful (in an anonymised form) to us to analyse your use of the Services.
    
* If you have requested information about the Services we provide, for example a quotation, we will retain your information for a period of up to 24 months from the provision of the information requested, after which your personal data will be deleted, providing that there is no ongoing legitimate reason for us to retain it.
    
* When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until permanent deletion is possible.
    

### Access to information

* You are entitled to access, correct or update your personal information. You can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contact” heading below.
    
* In certain circumstances you can object to our processing of your personal information, request deletion of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contact” heading below.
    
* You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.

* If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on other lawful grounds.

* We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

### Climate Clock

The Climate Clock is a version of the Doomsday clock that has been running since 1947 - this tracks the risk of global man-made disaster, through man made technology (like nuclear weapons) - displaying the minutes and seconds left before midnight, when disaster strikes. The climate crisis is a small part of the calculations made.

The climate clock uses a similar approach, but, focuses only on the climate crisis - which is the biggest and most urgent existential threat we face.

"The Climate Clock is a countdown to the biggest man-made disaster we face - but also a measure by which we can track our progress - moving from fossil to renewable energy. It shows we have no time to lose - the clock is ticking…" **Dale Vince, OBE.**
