**MEISTERLABS – PRIVACY NOTICE**
================================

**Last Updated**: November 2023

This Privacy Notice explains how MeisterLabs, Inc. (“**Meister**”, “**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”) collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal data in connection with our websites (the “**sites**”), our community platform (the “**platform**”) and our other services and web and mobile applications that link to this Privacy Notice (collectively, with the sites and the platform, the “**services**”). 

We may provide additional or supplemental privacy policies to individuals for specific promotions, products, or services that we offer, at the time that we collect any additional personal data.  These supplemental privacy policies will govern how we may process the information in the context of the specific promotion, product, or service.

### **What is Personal Data?**

When we use the term “personal data” in this Privacy Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to a person or household.  It does not include aggregated or de-identified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to a person.

### **Customer Data**

Data protection laws sometimes differentiate between “controllers” and “processors” of personal data. A “controller” determines the purposes and means (or the why and the how) of processing personal data. A “processor,” which is sometimes referred to as a “service provider,” processes personal data on behalf of a controller subject to contractual restrictions.

As part of our business relationship with our customers we are often asked to receive, gather, store, analyze, or otherwise process information, which may include personal data, on behalf of our customers. We refer to this type of information and personal data as “customer data.” When we process customer data, we generally act as a processor. This means we process customer data on behalf of our customers subject to restrictions set forth in our contracts with them.

This Privacy Notice does not cover or address how we or our customers process customer data in connection with our role as our customers’ processor. Instead, this Privacy Notice only covers our processing of personal data in our capacity as a controller. In addition, we are generally not permitted to respond to individual requests relating to customer data. As a result, we recommend referring to the privacy notice of the business with which you have a relationship for information on how they engage processors, like us, to process customer data on their behalf.

**1\. OUR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA**
---------------------------------------

We collect personal data directly from individuals or when they interact with us through our services. We also collect personal data automatically when an individual interacts with our services. At times, we may also collect personal data about an individual from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction with that individual. 

### **Personal Data Provided By Individuals**

We collect the following categories of personal data individuals provide to us in connection with our services:

* **Contact Information,** including first and last name, email address, phone number, and communication preferences. We use this information to fulfill your request or transaction, to communicate with you directly, and to send you marketing communications in accordance with your preferences. We also use contact information to send our newsletters to individuals who sign up for them.
    
* **Account Information**, including first and last name, email address, user ID and password, profile information, affiliations, job title, account balances, payment and purchase history information, and any other information individuals provide to us. We use this information to primarily administer an individual’s account, provide individuals with the relevant service and information, communicate with individuals regarding their account and their use of the services, and for customer support purposes.
    
* **User Content**, including user-created projects, tasks, mindmaps, comments and notes in combination with profile information (name, username, e-mail address, avatar). Tasks, mindmaps and notes may contain comments, uploaded files (e.g., text files, videos, images) and may be published publicly. If a user participates in our community forum, we also collect any information published. We use this information primarily to provide individuals with relevant services and allow individuals to interact with our services and platform. 
    
* **Payment Information**. If you sign up for one of our services requiring payment (i.e., subscription), we collect the information provided in connection with such payment. Please note that we use Braintree and PayPal, payment processors, to process credit card payments made to us. As such, we do not retain any personally identifiable financial information in connection with credit card payments, such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly by you to our third-party processor. The payment processor’s use of your personal data is governed by their privacy notice. To view the privacy policy of these providers, please visit the websites of above mentioned payment processors. 
    
* **Webinar and Demo Information**. If individuals register for a webinar or demo, we collect information from individuals such as name, email address, username, job title, organization, phone number, region/country, IP address, preferred language, attendance, comments posted during the webinar or demo, and any other information an individual provides to us. We use this information to primarily administer and facilitate the services, to conduct market research, to inform our marketing and advertising activities, to improve and grow our business, and to facilitate the related webinar or demo.
    
* **Feedback Information.**  We may also collect feedback, survey responses, and ratings you provide relating to our services or products. We use this information to communicate with you, to conduct market research, to inform our marketing and advertising activities, and to improve and grow our business.
    
* **Business Representative Contact Information.** If you are a business representative, we collect your information in connection with the performance of the agreement or potential agreement with us. This information may include your first name, last name, company contact information (e.g., email, phone, address), job title, and any other information related to the performance of the agreement with us.
    
* **Inquiry and Communications Information**, including information provided in custom messages sent through the forms, in chat messages, to one of our email addresses, or via phone. This also includes contact information provided on our services. We use this information to investigate and respond to your inquiries, and to communicate with you, to enhance the services we offer to our users, and to manage and grow our organization.
    

If you choose to contact us, we may need additional information to fulfill the request or respond to your inquiry. We may provide additional privacy disclosures where the scope of the request we receive or personal data we require fall outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy disclosures will govern how we may process the information you provide at that time.

### **Personal Data Automatically Collected**

As is true of many digital platforms, we collect certain data automatically when individuals use our services or otherwise interact with us:

* **Log Data**, including internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, device type and version, browser type and version, browser id, the URL entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, other user agent string data, the time spent on our services, and any errors that may occur during the visit to our services). Log data may overlap with the other categories of data below.
    
* **Analytics Data**, Including the electronic path taken to our services, through our services and when exiting our services, as well as usage and activity on our services, such as the links and content individuals view or engage with, platform features used, and people or accounts interacted with. 
    
* **Location Data,** such as general geographic location that we or our third-party providers may derive from your IP address. 
    

For information about our and our third-party partners’ use of cookies and related technologies to collect information automatically, and any choices you may have in relation to its collection, please refer to our [Cookie Notice](https://www.mindmeister.com/home/cookies). 

### **Personal Data from Third Parties and Other Sources**

We also obtain personal data from other sources, which we often combine with personal data we collect either automatically or directly from an individual.

We may receive the same categories of personal data as described above from the following sources and third parties:

* **Our Affiliates:** We may receive personal data from other companies and brands owned or controlled by Meister, and other companies owned by or under common ownership with Meister.  
    
* **Your Employer / Company**: If you interact with our services through your employer or company, we may receive your information from your employer or company, including another representative of your employer or company. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the services.
    
* **Other Users or Individuals who Interact with our Services**: We may receive your information from other users or other individuals who interact with our services. For example, if you engage in one of our communications hosted on third-party platforms, we will be able to see any public communications made within that platform. 
    
* **Social Media**: When an individual interacts with our services through various social media networks, such as when someone follows us or shares our content on social networks, we may receive some information about that individual that they permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon an individual’s privacy settings with the social network, and may include your profile information, name, external user ID, avatar URL, access tokens, profile picture, username, and any other information the individual permits the social network to share with third parties. Individuals should always review and, if necessary, adjust their privacy settings on third-party websites and social media networks and services before sharing information and/or linking or connecting them to other services. We use this information to primarily operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the services, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you messages about products and services that may be of interest to you.
    
* **Advertisers and Publishers**: We engage in advertising both on our platform and through third-party services. Advertisers and publishers may share personal data with us in connection with our advertising efforts. For example, we may obtain information about whether an advertisement on our platform led to a successful engagement between an individual and a third-party advertiser.
    
* **Service Providers**: Our service providers that perform services solely on our behalf, such as survey and marketing providers and payment processors, collect personal data and often share some or all of this information with us. The information may include contact information, demographic information, payment information, information about your communications and related activities, and information about your account. We may use this information to administer and facilitate our services, your account, and our marketing activities.
    
* **Business Partners**: We may receive your information from our business partners, such as companies that offer their products and/or services on our services. We may use this information to administer and facilitate our services, your account, and our marketing activities.
    
* **Single Sign-On**: We allow users to sign into our services through certain third-party accounts the user maintains. When you use single sign-on services to access our services, we do not receive your login credentials for the relevant third-party service. Instead, we receive tokens from the single sign-on service to help identify you in our system (such as by your username) and confirms you successfully authenticated with the single sign-on services. This information allows us to more easily provide access to our services.
    
* **Other Sources**: We may also collect personal data about individuals through other sources, such as publicly available sources, third-party data providers, brand partnerships, or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions.

Please submit a request by:

* Emailing [\[email protected\]](https://www.meisterlabs.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject line, “U.S. Data Subject Request.”
    

We will need to verify your identity and confirm you are a resident of a state that offers the request right(s) before processing your request. In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful login to your account or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems.

Although we try to limit the personal data collected in connection with a request to exercise any of the above rights, certain requests may require us to obtain additional personal data from you. In certain circumstances, we may decline a request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems, or where you are not a resident of one of the eligible states.

### **To Exercise the Right to Opt Out of the Selling or Sharing of Personal Data for Targeted Advertising Purposes**

The CCPA defines “selling” and “sharing” broadly to include not only traditional selling of data for monetary consideration, but also data sharing arrangements where the recipient can use the personal information that they receive for the recipient’s own business purposes. While we do not “sell” your Personal Information for monetary consideration, we do disclose certain Personal Information to third party ad tech companies to provide more relevant ads and content which can constitute “selling” or “sharing” under the CCPA.

We may sell or share personal data (including Identifiers, Commercial Information, Internet/Network Information, and Inferences) to certain third-party ad networks, social networks and advertising partners to deliver targeted advertising (also known as “cross-context behavioral advertising”) and personalized content to you on our services, on other sites and services you may use, and across other devices you may use, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.

The third parties to whom we sell or share personal data may use such information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own privacy statements, which may include reselling or sharing this information to additional third parties.

To facilitate these targeted advertising purposes, we and our third-party providers use cookies and related technologies to collect personal data about users of our services. To exercise your right to opt-out as it relates to the use of cookies and related technologies that involve the sale of personal data or the use of personal data for targeted advertising purposes on our Services, please click [here](https://accounts.meister.co/me/policies) to adjust your cookie preferences.

Please note these cookie options may be unchecked or opted out by default. In addition, this opt-out tool is device and browser specific, so you will need to change your preferences on each device and browser you use to interact with the services you are visiting.

You can also opt out of cookie-based sales by businesses that participate in the DAA’s CCPA Opt-Out Tool by visiting [https://www.privacyrights.info/](https://www.privacyrights.info/). In addition, you may follow the other steps set forth in our Cookie Notice to further exercise control over cookies and related technologies. Lastly, you may exercise your non-cookie-related rights by following the instructions provided at the beginning of this “How to Exercise Your Privacy Rights” section.

### **Authorized Agents**

In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf through the designated methods set forth above where we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. In order to verify the authorized agent’s authority, we generally require evidence of either (i) a valid power of attorney or (ii) a signed letter containing your name and contact information, the name and contact information of the authorized agent, and a statement of authorization for the request. Depending on the evidence provided and your state of residency, we may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm the authorized agent has permission to act on your behalf and to verify your identity in connection with the request.

### **Appealing Privacy Rights Decisions**

Depending on your state of residency, you may be able to appeal a decision we have made in connection with your privacy rights request. All appeal requests should be submitted by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.meisterlabs.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject line, “Privacy Request Appeal.”

* **Identifiers**, such as name, email address, telephone number, address, zip code, account username and password, or other similar identifiers.

For more information about our collection of personal data, the sources of personal data, and how we use this information, please see the [Our Collection of Personal Data](https://www.meisterlabs.com/privacy-us/#collection-of-personal-data) and [Our Use of Personal Data](https://www.meisterlabs.com/privacy-us/#use-of-personal-data) sections of our Privacy Notice.

### **Disclosure of Personal Data**

As described in the Our [Disclosure of Personal Data](https://www.meisterlabs.com/privacy-us/#disclosure-of-personal-data) section of our Privacy Notice, we disclose personal data with a variety of third parties for business purposes or we may sell or share your personal data to third parties for targeted advertising purposes, subject to your right to opt out of selling or sharing (see “Your Privacy Rights” above).

In the previous 12 months, we have sold or shared for targeted advertising purposes all of the categories of personal data we collect, explained above, to third parties.

### **Data Retention**

We retain personal data only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. However, if necessary, we may retain personal data for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator or other government authority.

To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal data and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations.

Therefore, we retain personal data for as long as the individual continues to use our services for the purposes explained in the [Our Use of Personal Data](https://www.meisterlabs.com/privacy-us/#use-of-personal-data) section in our Privacy Notice. When an individual discontinues the use of our services, we will retain their personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as, for any additional purpose based on the choices they have made, such as to receive marketing communications. In particular, we will retain call recordings, the personal data supplied when joining our services, including complaints, claims (for insurance products) and any other personal data supplied during the duration of an individual’s contract with us for the services until the statutory limitation periods have expired, when this is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

Once retention of the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or deidentify the personal data or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the personal data and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.

### **Notice of Financial Incentives**

We offer various programs, promotions and other financial incentives that may result in differences in our prices or services offered to consumers. For example:

* Discounts, coupons or other access to exclusive content, research, and insights for customers who sign up to receive our marketing emails or text messages; and
    
* Discounts, coupons or other benefits in connection with a contest or sweepstakes or similar promotion.
    

To obtain access to certain of these programs and other offerings, we may collect and retain personal data, such as name, username, userID, e-mail address, competition content (e.g. mindmap), date of participation in a sweepstake, answers/information provided to us in a survey. We have determined that the value of these programs and other incentives are reasonably related to the value of the personal data we receive and otherwise process in connection with these programs and offerings, based on our reasonable but sole determination. We estimate the value of the personal data we receive and otherwise process in connection with these programs and offerings by considering the expense we incur in collecting and processing the personal data, as well as the expenses related to facilitating the program or offering.

The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms or in the details of the incentive offer. Participating in any financial incentive program is entirely optional and participants may withdraw from the program at any time. To opt-out of the program and forgo any ongoing incentives, please follow the instructions in the program’s terms and conditions or contact us using the contact information below.  Participating individuals may also opt out of receiving marketing communications by following the instructions set forth in the [Choices and Controls Over Information](https://www.meisterlabs.com/privacy-us/#choices-controls-over-personal-data) section of our Privacy Notice.
