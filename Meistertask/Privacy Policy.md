### **7\. Cookies and web tracking**

#### **7.1. Definition of cookies and other technologies**

We use **cookies** to automatically collect data. Our website may contain cookies set by us or by third parties. A cookie is a text file containing a small amount of data. A website can send it to your browser, and it is then stored on your device as an anonymous tag that identifies your device. Some of the pages on our website use cookies in order to be able to offer you better services when you return. The data therefore stored and transferred in our cookies can be found in the [cookies list](https://www.mindmeister.com/home/cookies?_sp=d09fc099-d4df-446a-b209-bb18563187aa.1671011023505&_gl=1*ue3j3l*_ga*ODc3NDEyMDU4LjE2NjYwODI3MDI.*_ga_L9MM033MQ9*MTY3MTAxMDkzMS41MS4xLjE2NzEwMTA5NzEuMjAuMC4w).

In addition, we use **web beacons**, which are also known as 1×1 GIFs, clear GIFs or tags. Web beacons are tiny graphic images that may be embedded in our website. Web beacons allow us to optimise our products and services and to supply third-party partners with analysis data, e.g. how many users visit our website. We may also use web beacons in our email correspondence to determine whether you have opened an email or taken other actions. We also cooperate with other organisations and place our web beacons on their websites or advertisements. The aim of this is to derive statistics as to the number of times a visitor who clicks on an advertisement on a website of Meister GmbH or of an advertising partner actually follows up with a purchase or with some other interaction on the website of an advertising partner.

We use **device IDs** (“IDs”) to automatically collect data for our apps. An ID is a unique sequence of numbers and letters (“string”) that is associated with your device but does not identify you. The ID allows us and selected third parties to understand your behaviour when you use the app. Almost all apps use the ID technology. IDs have various purposes: For instance, they remember your preferences and generally improve your user experience; they tell us whether you have used our app before or whether it is your first visit; they ensure that the advertisements you see on our app are tailored to your interests. Consequently, IDs are extremely useful in improving your user experience.

#### **7.2. Necessary cookies**

Insofar as we use cookies and other tracking tools to provide our website and its basic functions (system cookies) and to store our cookie settings and login data, the legal base for the use of necessary cookies is § 25 sec 2 no. 2 TDDDG. 

#### **7.3. Other cookies**

Provided that you have given us your consent to use cookies and other tracking tools (according to Art. 6 Sec. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 Sec. 1 TDDDG), we use them for targeting, profiling and advertising, to personalise our offers and display personalised advertisements, as well as for anonymised analyses of website use (“web statistics”), so that we can continue to improve our offers and better align them with the needs and interests of the website visitors.

#### **7.4. Web analytics using Google (Universal) Analytics**

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Irland (“**Google**”). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. We process your personal data on the basis of your given consent (Art. 6 sec. 1 lit a GDPR). The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address, sessions statistics, approx. geo-location, browser information and device type) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google acts as our processor. The cookies used for this purpose expire after 24 months.

Our websites use an IP anonymization feature provided by Google Analytics. Your IP address will therefore be truncated/anonymized by Google as soon as it receives it. On our behalf, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to us.

#### **9.2. Online advertising and remarketing**

We are using various cookie-based online advertising tools to offer our website users a more personalized and engaged web experience by offering advertisements on the respective social media channels that are more relevant to them. 

**Google Analytics Remarketing**: Our websites and our services use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google Ads and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google. This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google Ads and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behaviour on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer). Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging. To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion. 

We process your personal data like session statistics, approx. geo-location, browser information and device type on the basis of your given consent (Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/) . 

**GoogleAds and Google Conversion Tracking**: We use Google Ads which is an online advertising program of Google. In the context of Google Ads we use the so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad placed by Google, a cookie will be set for the conversion tracking. Information about cookie lifespan can be found [here](https://business.safety.google/adscookies/?hl=en_US). If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this page. Each Google Ads customer gets a different cookie. The cookies can not be tracked over websites of Ads customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for Ads customers who have chosen for Conversion Tracking. Customers see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, we will not receive any information that can be used to identify users. 

We process your personal data on the basis of your given consent (Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/) . 

**Facebook Ads**: We use Facebook Ads (Facebook Pixel & Facebook Custom Audience) provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly Facebook), 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”). We integrate snippets of code provided by Facebook that load a small library of functions (sometimes referred to as “tracking pixels”, i.e. transparent, pixel-sized images embedded in websites with a tracking functionality). These functions enable us to track your activities on our website, such as URLs visited, domains visited, device(s) used, and, in particular advertising conversions (i.e. actions counted when you interact with one of our ads, such as clicking it and purchasing our product afterwards). Furthermore, we process your personal data like IP address, browser information, page location, document referrer, pixel-specific data (pixel ID, Facebook Cookie). The functions rely on cookies placed by Facebook, which may also enable us to match our website visitors to respective user accounts on the respective social media platform. We may also use the “Custom Audience” service provided by Facebook for delivering targeted advertising to you. In this context, we would check whether you hold an account with Facebook for which you use the same email-address that you have provided to us and include you in a corresponding “custom audience” group. This works by us providing your email-address to Facebook in a hashed format, and this way making sure that Facebook will only process, as a data processor on our behalf, actual email-addresses of users that have already subscribed to their service (further information on this process can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/112061095610075?id=2469097953376494&helpref=faq_content)).

We process your personal data on the basis of your given consent (Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent. You may also opt-out of receiving targeted ads because you are part of a custom audience created by MeisterLabs through clicking a corresponding link when you select the “Why am I seeing this?” feature on the Facebook platform (see [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/562973647153813?helpref=about_content))).

However, IP-addresses are truncated or hashed and direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous.

### **11\. Protection of our rights**

We process your personal data (account data, contractual data, financial data, communication data) in case disputes may arise, e.g. for the assertion of legal claims or in defense of legal disputes. The legal basis for processing of the data is our overriding legitimate interests to protect our organisation and exercise our right by initiating or responding to claims (Art. 6 sec. 1 lit f GDPR).

In such a case, data will be retained until the issue is resolved.

--------------------

We take technical and organisational measures to protect personal data from destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure and access. All data that you disclose to us and that we collect from you are stored on secure servers.

If you have a password to access our websites, apps or platform, you are responsible for keeping your password safe and confidential.

**E. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**
-----------------------------------

We may process your personal data within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in countries where the European Commission decided that they ensure an adequate level of protection.

For the purpose of

* product analytics and monitoring of our services
    
* tax compliance
    
* customer support and customer relationship management
    
* conducting surveys/feedback management
    
* online advertising
    

we commission processors based in the US and other third countries.

Insofar as we transfer personal data to third countries outside of the EEA, we ensure an appropriate level of data protection through contractual measures (i.e., Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission).

**F. YOUR RIGHTS**
------------------

### **1\. Right to withdraw consent**

Insofar as we process your data on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. As of receipt of your withdrawal of consent, we will no longer process these data in the future. Your withdrawal of consent does not, however, affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. 

### **2\. Right of access to personal data**

You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed. Where that is the case, you have the right of access to these data; in particular, regarding the purpose of processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients, the period for which the personal data will be stored, the source of the data, your rights with regard to these data, as well as, where personal data are transferred to a third country, the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 GDPR. Upon request, we will provide you with a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. 

### **3\. Right to rectification**

If we process personal data that is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to obtain the rectification or completion of your personal data.

### **4\. Right to erasure**

You have the right to obtain the erasure of personal data concerning you. We will erase your data if:

* these data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;
    
* you withdraw consent on which the processing is based, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;
    
* you object to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes;
    
* your personal data have been unlawfully processed;
    
* your personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
    
* these data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services to a child (Article 8(1) GDPR). 
    

The right to erasure does not, however, apply to the extent that processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation which requires processing, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, among other things.

### **5\. Right to restriction of processing**

In certain cases, you have the right to obtain restriction of processing of your personal data (without erasure). In consequence, we will continue to store these data, but will only process them with your consent, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.

You have the right to obtain restriction of processing if: 

* you contest the accuracy of the personal data, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
    
* you have objected to the processing of your data pending the verification whether legitimate grounds for processing prevail;
    
* the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data;
    
* we no longer need the personal data for the purpose of the processing, but do need them for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
    

### **6\. Right to object**

Even if the personal data concerning you are accurate and complete and are being lawfully processed by us, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation at any time. You only have this right if we process these data on the basis of our legitimate interests. In this case, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

Moreover, you have the right to object if you receive direct marketing from us and no longer wish to receive this in the future. In this case, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes.

### **7\. Right to data portability**

If the processing of your data is based on your consent or on a contract you entered into with us and the processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive the personal data provided by you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from us to another controller, where technically feasible.

### **8\. Right to lodge a complaint**

Although we do our utmost to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your data, disagreements about the way we process your data cannot be excluded. If you believe that the processing of your data violates the applicable data protection law, you may to contact us via: [\[email protected\]](https://www.meisterlabs.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

In case of questions and in case of possible concerns about the data processing, you can also contact a supervisory authority. The responsible supervisory authority for us is:
