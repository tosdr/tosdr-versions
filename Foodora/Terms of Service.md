Terms & Conditions
==================

GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
============================

  
  

These general terms and conditions (the "**Terms**") apply between you as a customer (the "**customer**", "**you**") and Delivery Hero Finland Oy (business ID 1936684-6), address Pasilankatu 10, 00240 Helsinki ("**foodora**", "**we**", "**us**"), when ordering food, drinks and other products (together referred to as "**Products**'' below) provided on [www.foodora.fi](https://www.foodora.fi/) or foodora's downloadable mobile application (the "**Platform**"). By registering an account with foodora, using the Platform and/or ordering Products and services from foodora and foodora’s Partners (as defined below) you confirm that you have read and agree to these Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and foodora. foodora reserves the right to update the Terms from time to time and by placing an order you approve the Terms applicable at the time of the order.  
  
The latest update of these Terms was made on 4 July 2024.  
  
Via the Platform, you as a customer can order the Products available on the Platform from time to time. The Platform distinguishes Products (including meals) prepared by restaurants ("**Restaurants**") and Products provided by stores ("**Shops**"). The Restaurants and Shops are jointly referred to as "**Partners**" and each as a "**Partner**", and all sales via the Platform are made with traders (in Finnish: _elinkeinonharjoittaja_), unless otherwise explicitly stated, whereby consumer laws and rights will apply.  
  
Products sold via the Platform are intended for personal use and are not to be resold or transferred.  
  
If you have any questions regarding these Terms you may always contact our customer service at [\[email protected\]](https://www.foodora.fi/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  
  
We reserve the right to develop and use policies, procedures, measures and tools to ensure that the Platform is used in a way that is not illegal and otherwise complies with our policies and these Terms. In the event that the Platform is used in a manner that is illegal or otherwise does not comply with our policies or these Terms, we also reserve the right to review and act against such practices. Read more about our right to act against Customers in sections 7 and 10.  
  

**1\. Products and services**
-----------------------------

  
  
We, foodora, provide a Platform where you as a customer can order Products from Restaurants and Shops for delivery or pick-up at the Partner's location ("**Pick-Up**").  
  
The Products are delivered by foodora’s courier partners or Partners to the delivery address specified by you when placing the order, unless you choose Pick-Up, in which case you are responsible to pick up the order at the relevant location and time stated for your order.  
  
foodora processes and administers all orders made through the Platform. At the time of placing your order, you pay for the Products, including any applicable delivery and other fees, directly on the Platform. You do not pay anything to the courier who delivers the Product to you, or to the Partner in connection with Pick-Up, unless you have chosen to pay upon delivery or pick-up, as applicable.  
  
**_Orders from Restaurants_**  
  
When ordering Products from Restaurants through the Platform, foodora acts as seller of the meals and other Products which are prepared by the Restaurants with the exception for orders where cash-on-delivery or card-on-delivery is used as the payment method in which cases the Restaurant shall act as seller.  
  
**_Order from Shops_**  
  
When ordering Products from Shops through the Platform, foodora acts as intermediary between you and the vendor (the Shop) to facilitate, process and conclude the order on these Terms and any additional terms stated by or on behalf of the Shop when placing the order.  
  

**1.1 Offering and ranking of Partners and Products**
-----------------------------------------------------

  
  
The range of Partners and Products on the Platform may differ from time to time and are limited to Products delivered from Partners with a business location near the delivery address specified by you. The range further depends on availability of the Partners and applicable delivery time to your specified address.  
  
Partners have the option to pay for preferential ranking on the pages displaying Restaurants and Shops to customers, as well as in search results. Such listings are marked as "featured", "sponsored", "promoted" or similar. Other than paid placement, and subject to the option for you as a customer to filter or sort listing in a particular order (e.g., filtering cuisines or using "sort: fastest delivery"), the range and ranking may depend on other parameters to ensure that you get a good customer experience. When changing your delivery address, or if you choose Pick-Up, the offering and ranking may change and we refer to the offering available on the Platform from time to time, as delivery areas can also change depending on e.g., weather, traffic, demand, and other situations.  
  
We use recommender systems to sort Products and Partners on the Platform. The offering and ranking of Partners and Products on the Platform may vary from time to time but is always designed to provide you with a good customer experience such as by showing options most relevant for you. In cases where you can change the recommended sorting (for example to sort by delivery time or distance instead) you will see this option in our user interface.  
  
The offering presented is, among other things, based on your chosen delivery address and potential filters that you can use on the Platform, e.g., filtering based on specific categories or by delivery time. Further, criteria such as Partners’ popularity, which is determined by order and click history of other foodora users in relation to the Partner, and interpretations of your preferences, which are based on your previous orders and your use of the Platform, are used. To ensure the quality of the Product until delivery and the delivery time to you, the offering on the Platform is however limited to Products delivered from Partners with its place of business close to your delivery address.  
  
Thus, if you change your delivery address, or choose Pick-Up, the offering and ranking may change, but other circumstances such as weather, traffic and demand may also affect the offering and ranking.  
  
If any paid placements are added to the list of Partners or Products you see, they will be clearly marked as such, as set out above.  
  
**_How search results are ranked_**  
  
When searching for Partners on the Platform, search results may be ordered based on the following principles:  
  

* _Proximity of your search query:_ The search results that most closely reflect the wording of your search query will be listed higher. This may be based on the listed names of the Partners and/or their specific offerings.
* _Opening hours, distance and delivery time:_ Based on your search query, the order of search results will be based on opening hours, distance and delivery time for the relevant Partners to your specified delivery location. The shorter the delivery time, the higher the Partner will be listed higher in your search results, and where there are more than one Partner under the same brand in the same delivery area, the search result may be restricted to only show the Partner under such brand with the shortest delivery time. Note that changing the delivery location or choosing Pick-Up may change the search results.
* _Characteristics of the Products or cuisine:_ If your search query consists of special characteristics relating to Products or Partners (e.g., "sushi"), the listings that most closely reflect those characteristics will be listed higher.
* _Popularity:_ The popularity of certain Partners (measured by views and/or placed orders in a specific time frame) may also affect the order of search results. The greater the popularity of a Partner (based on the above criteria), the higher it will be listed.
* _Paid placement:_ The order of search results may also be affected by paid placement and marketing and campaigns, and relevant Partners will be marked as such.

  
  
By using search filters such as “free delivery” or specific cuisines, and by adding Restaurants and Shops to your favourites you can further customise and limit the range of Partners displayed.  
  

**1.2 Orders and receipts**
---------------------------

  
  
All orders are made on the Platform by selecting the Product(s) you wish to purchase by adding them to your cart and then placing an order at checkout. When placing an order, you choose if you want your order to be delivered as soon as possible or if you want to use Pick-Up and collect the order at the Partner's location yourself. You can also choose to place a pre-order for delivery or Pick-Up at a later time or date. A pre-order can be made up to a maximum of three (3) days in advance.  
  
Your order is an offer to purchase the Products listed in your order and an amount corresponding to the order value is charged through the chosen method of payment, unless you choose cash-on-delivery or card-on-delivery as the payment method in which case you are charged upon receipt of the order. You will receive an email confirming that your order has been successfully placed, and we will update you on the Platform once the Partner has received your order and the estimated delivery or Pick-Up time will be provided on the Platform. Please note that you can only cancel an order until the order is confirmed received by the relevant Partner, upon which foodora will commence its delivery services. By placing an order, you confirm that the delivery costs may be non-refundable and that you have forfeited your right of withdrawal in respect of the delivery service.  
  
Our Partners will comply with any special instructions included for the order or a Product in your order to the extent feasible and commercially reasonable. The Partner or foodora are not responsible to replace or refund any order and/or Product(s) with any special instructions provided by customers. For any special instructions which relates to allergens, allergic reactions, or dietary restrictions or requirements, please contact the Partner before placing the order as set out in section 1.4 below.  
  
Upon delivery and completion of the order, foodora will provide a receipt for your purchase to your registered email address either on its own behalf or on behalf of the relevant seller, as applicable.  
  
Please note that foodora never accepts orders for Products by email or by live chat and that payment is always made on the Platform, unless you have chosen to pay upon delivery or pick-up, as applicable.  
  
The risk for loss of or damage to the Product passes to you once the Product has been delivered to the location specified for the order. Neither foodora nor its Partners shall be liable for any loss or damage caused to Products after delivery. You are responsible for collecting the Product at the specified delivery address (or if Pick-Up is selected, to collect the Products at the Partner’s relevant location), and no refunds will be made due to your failure to receive or pick up the Product.  
  

**1.3 Terms for delivery**
--------------------------

  
  
Delivery and pick-up times provided by foodora via the Platform constitute estimated times and the delivery time of the order may be affected by traffic and weather conditions and other reasons beyond foodora's control. To ensure the quality of the Products upon delivery, orders to be delivered by couriers that foodora itself partners with are not forwarded to the Partner until we have a courier partner available.  
  
For orders delivered by Partners, foodora may ask you to contact the Partner directly in the event of issues or delays.  
  
**_Delivery_**  
  
When placing an order on the Platform with delivery (direct or pre-order), you acknowledge and agree that the Products ordered will be delivered to the location or street address provided by you for the relevant order.  
  
You are responsible to remain available to receive calls at the phone number submitted by you on the Platform at the time of delivery. As set out under section 3 below, foodora is not liable for orders that encounter delivery issues due to incomplete, incorrect, or missing information provided or omitted by you.  
  
Deliveries can only be made to locations where couriers can locate and access the delivery address and you must be present at the relevant delivery location or street address, unless the order is to be left by the door. We also ask you to observe that we may be required to verify your identity for delivery of the Products. If you are not available to receive the order upon delivery, the courier can deliver the Products by the door to the extent no restrictions apply, e.g., the order contains Products for which customer identification or similar is required, in which case you will be deemed to have agreed that the delivery may be made at the door. Once the Products are delivered at the agreed location the risk will transfer to you.  
  
foodora or its Partners are under no obligation to deliver any order by the door to the extent restrictions apply or if it is otherwise deemed inappropriate.  
  
If:  
  
(a) you cannot be reached at the phone number provided by you and delivery cannot be completed, or  
(b) in the case of orders including Products for which ID checks are required and/or for which age restrictions or other requirements apply ("Restricted Products"), you or the person receiving the Products is unable to present valid means of identification (e.g., a valid ID card), underaged, or perceived as drunk or intoxicated, or otherwise does not meet the requirements for delivery or there are reasons to suspect bootlegging,  
  
foodora reserves the right to cancel your order. foodora is entitled to charge a fee of EUR 20 (or, if the order value is less, the full order value) to cover for costs and expenses related to the cancellation of the order, and foodora further has the right to charge for costs and expenses in respect of any Products that foodora or the Partner is unable to resell. This will be charged by way of reducing the amount which can be refunded (depending on your chosen method of payment) due to the cancellation of the order.  
  
For orders which include Restricted Products it may be required that the order is received by the person placing the order, and contactless delivery may be restricted whereby orders cannot be left by the door if you are not available to receive the order.  
  
**_Pick-up_**  
  
If you have selected Pick-Up when placing the order, the Products are to be picked up by yourself at the Partner’s relevant location at the time specified on the Platform. The Partner may require that you identify yourself with a valid ID when collecting the order and that no other restrictions to deliver the Products apply, including but not limited to Products that require an ID check or for which age restrictions or other requirements apply.  
  
If the order is not picked up within a reasonable time from the specified Pick-Up time (generally 30 minutes depending on the Products and opening hours of the relevant Partner) you may be charged full price for the relevant Products to the extent that these cannot be resold and/or any other costs of foodora or the Partner in relation to the order.  
  

**1.4 Content and quality of meals and foodstuffs**
---------------------------------------------------

  
  
Meals and foodstuff made available for purchase on the Platform are prepared and packaged by Partners who are liable to make a notification of food premises with the food control authority of the municipality in which the Partner is located. Once the meal has been prepared, the Partner will pack the meal and, unless you have selected Pick-Up, it will be transported to you by a suitable means of transport.  
  
foodora and its personnel do not prepare and/or interfere with the preparation and packaging of meals or any ingredients they contain or other foodstuff, and only handle the Products to the extent needed for the purpose of completing delivery for orders where foodora is providing the delivery service.  
  
**_Meals_**  
  
For meals made available on the Platform, a list of ingredients is provided by the Partner preparing the meal. However, we cannot guarantee that any such list is accurate/or up to date at all times and Restaurants may have made changes to the ingredients included in the meal which we are not aware of. For this reason, we kindly ask you to contact the relevant Restaurant directly for information about e.g., allergens, ingredients, or the origin of raw materials. Contact details to the Restaurant are provided on the Partner’s page on the Platform.  
  
In case you are very sensitive to contact with certain allergens, please note that even if the Restaurant ensures that your order is packaged in a separate bag, your food may be delivered in the same transport bag as other Products.  
  
Meals from Restaurants are intended to be eaten immediately upon delivery, unless expressly stated otherwise, and foodora and the Restaurant are not responsible for the quality of the meal if consumed later.  
  
**_Food_**  
  
If your order contains pre-packaged food, it is important that you carefully read the list of ingredients on the packaging before consuming those foods, especially if you are allergic to certain food or ingredients. Please note that foodora does not guarantee that the lists of ingredients displayed on the Platform are correct or up to date. If you have any questions about the ingredients of food marketed through the Platform, please contact the relevant Partner.  
  
Partners pick and prepare your order for immediate delivery or collection, which can be compared to when you shop directly in store. In order to ensure that the Products maintain the quality upon delivery and that refrigerated and frozen goods are picked up without delay, your order is not forwarded to the Partner until we have an available courier, and foodora requires that couriers use a clean insulated thermal bag in accordance with applicable food safety laws and regulations.  
  

**1.5 Specific terms for certain products**
-------------------------------------------

  
  
**_Gift cards_**  
  
Gift cards sold by foodora on the Platform or in other channels are valid for one (1) year from the date of purchase, cannot be redeemed for cash and can only be used for Restaurant orders via the Platform, unless otherwise stated. The gift card is issued by foodora in the form of a code that can be used for one (1) purchase and cannot be combined with other discount codes or vouchers. Vouchers (as defined in section 2.3 below) and other discounts or offers cannot be used to purchase gift cards.  
  
Any amount on the gift card that exceeds the total amount of the order for which the code of the gift card is used, will be used up. If the order value exceeds the amount of the gift card, it is possible to pay any excess with the usual means of payment.  
  
What is stated regarding Vouchers in section 2.3 below applies to gift cards in general.  
  

**2\. Price and payment**
-------------------------

  
  

**2.1 Prices**
--------------

  
  
The prices of each Product and the delivery service as well as the amount of the service fee, as applicable from time to time, charged on all orders for providing the Platform service, are presented on the Platform at the time of ordering. All prices displayed on the Platform are displayed including applicable VAT. foodora and the Partner reserve the right to update prices and/or content and information of the Products and foodora’s services to apply for orders placed after the change has been made.  
  
Please note that for group orders the order will be placed by the host at the prices applicable to the host’s account. Prices, Vouchers, and discounts available to "guests" may not be applicable to the host.  
  
Discounts and offers may apply for specific Partners as well as depending on the ordered Products or amount, and may be offered at the expense of foodora or the Partner. Furthermore, foodora may offer loyalty programmes and similar from time to time. Prices may further differ depending on dynamic pricing practices applicable from time to time.  
  
**_Minimum Order Value_**  
  
For orders including delivery services placed via the Platform, a minimum order value ("**MOV**") may apply. The MOV may differ from Partner to Partner but is stated in your cart before checkout and upon placing an order. When placing an order for Product(s) with a total value lower than the MOV, you can choose between paying the difference between the total price of the Product(s) and the applicable MOV or add Products to your order to meet the MOV. Please note that the MOV costs are in relation to services provided in connection with your order and may not be refunded in the event of a return.  
  
**_Bottle and other deposits_**  
  
The prices for beverages sold in bottles and cans are displayed including applicable bottle deposit.  
  
foodora and Partners may have partnerships with other third-party providers in respect of deposits on food containers. Such deposits will be included in the prices for the relevant Products and further information can be provided by the relevant Partner.  
  

**2.2 Delivery fee**
--------------------

Delivery fees are displayed for each Partner separately and in your cart. The delivery fee may depend e.g. on distance to the relevant Restaurant or Shop, the time of the day and any campaigns or offers in relation to the delivery fee offered at the time of placing an order.  
  

**2.3 Introductory prices, offers, campaigns and Vouchers**
-----------------------------------------------------------

  
  
foodora may from time to time offer voucher codes, discounts, and other promotional offers to you to be used on the Platform ("**Vouchers**").  
  
Vouchers are subject to specified validity and redemption periods, and introductory prices or "trial offers" offered by foodora to customers can only be used once. The same applies in respect of other campaigns or promotions offered for use on the Platform, unless expressly stated otherwise in the terms for the relevant voucher, campaign or offer. foodora reserves the right to terminate vouchers, campaigns and the offering of introductory prices or promotions for future orders at any time without prior notice to the customer.  
  
Vouchers with a specified face value issued by foodora can be redeemed upon placing an order for Products and services available on the Platform, unless otherwise stated in the Voucher or in the terms applicable to the Voucher. A Voucher cannot be redeemed for cash and can only be used once, regardless of whether the full amount is used or not. Once the gift card or Voucher expires, it can no longer be used for payment on the Platform, cannot be reactivated, and any remaining unused value will not be refunded. In general, refund vouchers issued at the option of you as a customer (as referred to in 5.1 below) will be valid for a period of 30 days, and other face value Vouchers (including gift cards) have a maximum validity period of one (1) year from the date of issuance.  
  
Certain Partners and Products (including but not limited to gift cards referred to in section 1.5 above) may be exempt from offers, campaigns, promotions, and other Vouchers and (unless otherwise stated at the time of ordering) only one offer or Voucher can be redeemed or used per order. Vouchers cannot be combined with other discount codes and can only be applied before placing an order. foodora does not add discounts or Vouchers on orders retroactively.  
  
Vouchers and other offers may be personal, and it is prohibited to resell Vouchers to third parties except as permitted by foodora. In the event of fraud, abuse, or improper or unauthorised use of offers, campaigns, promotions, or Vouchers, foodora may choose to terminate, revoke, or invalidate these, and foodora reserves the right to charge the customer for costs and expenses in relation to such activity and to suspend customers who continuously misuse the Platform.  
  

**2.4 Payment**
---------------

  
  
Unless otherwise expressly agreed, payment for any orders shall be made on the Platform at the time of ordering by using direct payment, debit/credit card or by any other payment methods made available on the Platform at the time of placing the order. The available methods of payment will be displayed in check-out and generally accepted methods of payment are displayed on the Platform. Please note that foodora cannot guarantee that all methods of payment are available at all times, and some payment methods may be temporarily unavailable or restricted from time to time. foodora and its Partners further reserve the right to offer additional and/or remove existing payment methods at any time at its sole discretion. With your consent, your debit or credit card / payment information may be stored with our third-party payment service provider(s) for future orders. foodora does not store your debit or credit card or payment information.  
  
foodora may offer the possibility to use lunch benefits as a payment method in partnership with one or several third-party service providers. You are liable to ensure that you only use such lunch benefit to pay for Products for which the use of lunch benefit is permitted by applicable laws and regulations.  
  
If you have a valid promotional or discount Voucher, you can use this to pay for a part or all of your order before check-out as the case may be.  
  
In connection with orders for Products made available from Shops, foodora will direct the payments to the Shop.  
  
**_No payment services_**  
  
foodora does not provide any payment services to you or to third parties. All online payments are processed via your own issuer/payment service provider and the payment service providers in partnership with foodora.  
  
**_Voluntary tips_**  
  
Please note that any tips given by you are collected on behalf of the rider and are not subject to refunds.  
  

**3\. Your commitment as a customer at foodora**
------------------------------------------------

You confirm that you are the lawful owner of the debit/credit cards or lunch benefit accounts used by you to make any purchases on the Platform. You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide when registering your user account with foodora or placing an order on the Platform is correct and foodora shall not be liable for orders that encounter delivery issues due to incomplete, incorrect, or missing information provided or omitted by you. You agree to keep your login credentials and other account information confidential and secure and to not share such information with anyone else, and you commit to inform foodora promptly if your credentials and/or password are obtained by a third party, in which event foodora shall reserve the right to close or delete your user account credentials without advance notification. Please note that foodora only permits one (1) account per customer and if you forget your password, you can reset this by using the link "Forgot your password?" at [www.foodora.fi](https://www.foodora.fi/) or "I forgot my password" on the app under login.  
  
If you register and/or use the Platform as a corporate legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are fully authorised and have the capacity to represent and act on behalf of such legal entity.  
  
Any unauthorised commercial use of the Platform is strictly prohibited, and you agree not to resell or assign any right or obligations in relation thereto by accepting these Terms.  
  
If you wish to delete your account, please send an email to our customer support at [\[email protected\]](https://www.foodora.fi/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  
  
**_Intellectual property_**  
  
All trademarks, logos, images, and service marks, including these Terms as displayed on the Platform or in our marketing material are the intellectual property of foodora, foodora’s Partners and/or third parties who have authorised foodora with the right to use such proprietary rights (collectively the “**Intellectual Property**”). You may not use, copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, distribute, or modify these Intellectual Property in any way without foodora’s prior express written consent. The use of Intellectual Property rights, including foodora’s trademarks and copyrights to foodora’s logos and brand without our approval is strictly prohibited, save for as required to use the Platform or foodora’s services.  
  
In the event of fraud, abuse, or improper, unauthorised, or unlawful use of the Platform, as determined in the sole discretion of foodora, foodora reserves the right to suspend customers from the Platform and/or terminate or disable the customer’s account, and to charge the customer for costs and damage suffered by foodora or Partners.  
  

**4\. Personal data processing and data protection**
----------------------------------------------------

  
  
We process your personal data in accordance with foodora’s [privacy statement](https://www.foodora.fi/en/contents/privacy.htm) and by accepting the Terms, you are aware that we may send emails and/or text messages in relation to your order.  
  

**5\. Complaints, feedback, and cancellation rights**
-----------------------------------------------------

**5.1 Complaints and feedback for orders from Restaurants and food items from Shops**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  
We want you to be satisfied with our service! In the event of any missing items or if the Products you receive are faulty, incorrect or do not match your order, we kindly ask you to immediately contact our Help Center or customer service with pictures (if applicable) and description of the problem. Once notice of the complaint or claim has been received, your matter will be investigated as soon as possible to identify the problem and seek a solution in accordance with the applicable mandatory consumer protection legislation. foodora reserves the right to determine what is considered an appropriate solution in each situation. Please note that it is the seller of the Product(s) that is responsible for complaints, faulty products, and warranty matters, why foodora may refer you to the Partner, in cases where a Partner is the seller of the Product(s).  
  
When you register a complaint in respect of Restaurant orders, you as a customer may be given the opportunity to choose whether you want a refund (if eligible) via the same payment method used in the original purchase or if you want a refund in the form of a voucher (discount code) which can be used for future purchases on the Platform. A refund voucher is valid for 30 days and is stored on your profile and can (unless otherwise stated) only be used for purchases on the Platform regarding Products from Restaurants. In the event of a partial refund being made in respect of an order for which lunch benefit has been used as a payment method, foodora cannot make such partial refund to your relevant third-party lunch benefit account. Instead, in the case of such partial refunds, foodora offers you the possibility of either replacing any faulty or erroneous Products in your order or by refunding the relevant amount to a refund voucher.  
  
Furthermore, our customer service may issue compensation vouchers to customers in respect of cases which are not eligible for a (full) refund. Compensation vouchers are valid for 30 days, and available in the voucher wallet on your customer account. Please note that the terms and conditions that apply to Vouchers in general in accordance with section 2.3 above also apply to refund and compensation vouchers and that these cannot be combined with other discount or promotion codes or Vouchers.  
  
As orders placed via the Platform are directed to our Partners who prepare the relevant Products for delivery, we do wish to bring to your attention that foodora cannot provide redelivery in the event of missing or faulty items. Instead, foodora will provide compensation for any missing or faulty items whereby you can place a new order.  
  

**5.2 Returns and complaints for other orders from Shops**
----------------------------------------------------------

  
  
Returns and complaints are made directly to the Shop in accordance with the Shop’s applicable policy, and the Shop is responsible to approve or reject returns and/or complaints.  
  

**5.3 Cooling-off**
-------------------

You have the right to withdraw from the purchase by giving us or the Partner notice that you wish to exercise your right of withdrawal within 14 days of receiving the Product, or a substantial part of the Product (the "**Cooling-Off Period**"). However, this does not apply to any purchase of meals, foods with a short shelf life, in case of risk of contamination or when we cannot guarantee unbroken cold chain, or goods which are specially made based on your individual selection or determination, and in other situations where there exists an explicit exception under the applicable consumer protection legislation. Your right to withdraw from the purchase and receive a refund is subject to that no seals are broken (if applicable) and foodora or the Partner has the right to deduct any depreciation as a result of the Product being handled to a greater extent than was necessary to determine its properties or function. You can read more about your right of withdrawal and what products and services are exempted from the said right on the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority’s (in Finnish: Kilpailu- ja kuluttajavirasto) website.  
  
Please note that by placing an order and accepting the Terms, you have provided your express consent that the delivery service will commence as soon as the Partner has confirmed your order and that you have agreed that you have forfeited your right of withdrawal at the latest once the service has been completed.  
  

**5.4 Exercising your withdrawal rights**
-----------------------------------------

  
  
If you wish to exercise your right to withdraw from a purchase of a Product from a Shop, you must contact the relevant Shop within the Cooling-Off Period and the Partner will then provide information on how to return your Product. The Partner’s contact details can be found on the Shop page on the Platform and in your receipt for the purchase. For return of Products from Restaurants, please notify foodora that you wish to exercise your right of withdrawal.  
  
Information about the company from which you bought the Product (i.e., foodora or the Partner) is stated in the receipt, and you need to state that you wish to withdraw from the purchase including order number and date of the order, the relevant Product(s) you wish to return, your name and address and date. You can also use the cancellation form and deliver it to the company you purchased the Product from. The cancellation form can be found [here](https://euvolo-images.foodora.com/marketing/production/po/images/nl/Foodora%20Pro%20Cancellation%20form%20EN.pdf?v=1421756004).  
  
Please note that your right to withdraw does not apply if the order is returned to the Partner due to failure to deliver the order unless you have notified us of your wish to exercise the right of withdrawal in advance of the attempted delivery. Upon failure to deliver, the order will be cancelled, and we reserve the right to charge you for the incurred costs in accordance with section 2.2 above.  
  

**5.5 Returns when exercising your withdrawal rights**
------------------------------------------------------

  
  
Returns of Products sold by a Shop shall be made directly to the relevant Shop and unless otherwise specified by the Partner.  
  
When exercising your withdrawal rights, the Product must be returned within 14 days of submitting the withdrawal notice. For information about a Shop’s location and opening hours, or return address, we refer to the information provided by the Shop or on your receipt. If you choose to send the Product to the Shop, you are solely responsible for any return costs unless otherwise stated by the Shop and remain responsible for the condition of the Product from the time of receipt of the Product.  
  
Products should be returned appropriately packaged, in good condition and, if applicable, in the original packaging. Please ensure appropriate means for the return and use packaging that adequately protects the Products from transport damage suitable for the means of the return freight. All accessories related to the Products and the parts included in the package must be returned with the Products, including any original packaging and labels. If you have negligently used or handled or packaged the Products, or otherwise handled a Product beyond what is required to determine the nature, characteristics, or functionality of the Product, you are responsible for compensating for any impairment of the returned Products (up to the full price of the Products).  
  

**5.6 Refunds for returns**
---------------------------

  
  
Upon approval of your return, refund will be made by using the same payment method as you used when paying for the order, unless otherwise expressly agreed or provided in these Terms. The Partner will also be entitled to (as and if applicable) reduce the refund amount by an amount equal to the decrease in value of the Product that may have resulted in the Product being handled to a greater extent than required to determine its properties or function.  
  
Please note that for orders from Shops, the Partner is responsible for handling and approving returns in its capacity as seller and that the Partner may refrain from refunding the payment until the Partner has received the Product or proof that the Product has been returned.  
  
foodora does not refund its own fees for delivery or other services performed in connection with completion of the order, or any costs relating to minimum order value in relation to returns of Products purchased from Shops as these fees are related to services provided by foodora and not by the Shop as seller. In addition, in the event that you have paid part or whole of the order by way of Vouchers or your order was subject to other promotion, this will not be refunded save for in respect of gift cards, refund vouchers or other Vouchers with a specific face value, in which case we will reissue a voucher with such face value to your account. Furthermore, as mentioned above you will be responsible for any costs when returning Products.  
  

**6\. Customer service**
------------------------

  
  
Should you have any questions regarding the Platform, Products, ordering or our services, please contact our customer service. You can access our Help Center through the Platform. Alternatively, you can contact us by email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.foodora.fi/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). For up-to-date information on customer service opening hours, please see our website.  
  

**7\. Customer reviews**
------------------------

  
  
Verified customers have the opportunity to rate and review Partners on the Platform. Please note that any reviews placed on the Platform shall be free of racist, sexist, offensive, insulting, harassing, libellous or otherwise threatening or illegal content and should not otherwise violate any third-party rights (including intellectual property rights) and are further subject to our review guidelines which you can find [here](https://www.foodora.fi/en/contents/reviews-guideline?r=1).  
  
We perform automated and manual checks on reviews and in the event that a submitted review is deemed, at our sole discretion or following a notification made according to section 8, to be illegal or in breach of these Terms, we have the right to remove the review in question from the Platform. If a Customer frequently leaves reviews that have content that is illegal or in breach of these Terms, we also have the right to temporarily suspend the Customer from the Platform after having issued a prior warning. We will always provide the Customer with a clear and specific statement of reasons for our decision and the temporary suspension will, in the first instance, last for a maximum of 15 days. However, if the behaviour is deemed serious, we may decide to terminate the Customer's account with immediate effect, but the Customer will always be notified by email.  
  
We have processes in place to ensure that ratings and reviews are genuine, and that they originate from customers who have actually made a purchase from the relevant Partner. For example, you are only able to rate and review Partners after your order is delivered and only for a limited amount of time.  
  
Ratings are currently visible in each Restaurant's front page and reviews can be found in the info page of each Restaurant.  
  

**8\. Customer notices**
------------------------

  
  
Customers always have the right to contact our customer service to report information or content on the Platform that they consider to be illegal or against these Terms. Please find contact information to our customer service at the beginning of these Terms.  
  
Please note that in case you frequently submit notices or complaints that are manifestly unfounded, we have the right to temporarily suspend you from submitting notices or complaints as well as temporarily suspend the processing of your notices or complaints. Such suspensions will only occur after we have issued a prior warning and will, in the first instance, last for a maximum of 15 days. Temporary suspensions will be carried out in cases where:

* you have already submitted a notice or complaint about the same content in the past and the notice or complaint has already been examined by us;
* your notice or complaint is clearly unfounded and/or fictitious, and/or you are clearly not acting in good faith (e.g., notice or complaint relates not to content per se, but to the contributor of the content); or
* your notice or complaint lacks basic arguments and/or supporting facts illustrating why such content is allegedly illegal and/or against these Terms.
  
  
For information on our internal complaint handling system towards our decisions, see section 10.  
  

**9\. Availability of the services**
------------------------------------

  
  
The content on the Platform is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. While foodora makes reasonable efforts to ensure the provision of the Platform and the services we offer are available at all times, we do not warrant or represent that access to the Platform is provided in a manner which is secure, timely, uninterrupted, error-free and free of technical difficulties, defects or viruses. Please expect temporary interruptions of the Platform due to scheduled or regular system maintenance work, downtimes attributable to internet or electronic communications or events of force majeure.  
  
foodora is not responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or damage, loss or injury resulting from any problems inherent in the use of the Platform, internet, and electronic communications.  
  

**10\. foodora's right to terminate offering its services and internal complaint-handling system**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  
foodora reserves the right to deregister or suspend the customer's use of the Platform, and to suspend any ongoing or pre-ordered orders or otherwise terminate its services with immediate effect for customers who violate these Terms, abuses foodora's services, or otherwise causes harm or inconvenience to foodora, foodora's Partners or foodora's customers through the use of the Platform and foodora's services, or if foodora has reasonable grounds to believe that the Platform and the services are being misused, foodora suspects repeated false orders or complaints or if otherwise there is reason to suspect that the use of the Platform is unacceptable or an order is not correct or authentic. Such termination may be effected immediately with the customer being notified of the termination by email. In the event of termination, foodora will reimburse applicable amounts in respect of uncompleted orders (if any) as reduced by the costs of foodora or the Partner incurred as a result thereof.  
  
In the event that you have frequently provided content on the Platform which, in our own discretion or following a notification made under section 8, is deemed to be illegal or otherwise in breach of these Terms, we reserve the right to temporarily suspend you from the Platform for a reasonable period of time after having issued a prior warning. We will always provide the Customer with a clear and specific statement of reasons for our decision and the temporary suspension will, in the first instance, last for a maximum of 15 days. However, if your behaviour is deemed material, we may decide to terminate your account with immediate effect, but you will always receive an email to that effect. Regardless of the severity of the behaviour, we may always claim compensation from you for costs and damages incurred by us or our Partners as a result of your behaviour.  
  
If you receive a decision from us regarding content removal, suspension or closing down of an account made in accordance with sections 7, 8 and this section 10, you can appeal the decision. Information on how and where to submit an appeal will be provided with the decision. Please note that the appeal must be submitted by you within six (6) months from the date you receive the decision.  
  
foodora reserves the right to disable use of email addresses and/or payment details or methods previously linked to suspected or established fraudulent use of the Platform. If you have any issues with your account, please reach out to customer service.  
  

**11\. Third-party links and websites**
---------------------------------------

  
  
The Platform may contain links to third-party websites, applications, or advertisements and by clicking on these links, you agree to do so at your own risk. foodora does not control or endorse any third-party websites, links, applications, or advertisements and shall not be responsible for the content of these linked pages and accepts no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage which may be suffered by you in relation to your access and use of these third-party links, websites, applications or advertisements.  
  

**12\. Miscellaneous**
----------------------

  
  

* foodora may transfer its rights and obligations under the Terms to a third party, provided that the acquiring third party can be expected to fulfil its obligations under the Terms in a, from the customer’s perspective, satisfactory manner.
* The Customer may not transfer its rights and obligations under these Terms to any third party.
* foodora has the right to demand compensation from you for possible damages that foodora (including its directors, employees, partners, or other affiliates) suffers because of your misuse of the Platform or you otherwise breach these Terms.

  
  
In addition to what is otherwise stated in the Terms, and unless otherwise provided by mandatory law, the following applies regarding foodora's liability to you as a Customer:  
  

* foodora does not make any warranties regarding the function, availability, usability or security of the Platform or its services.
* Except as set out in the Terms, foodora makes no warranties regarding any content, raw materials, ingredients or other information or services relating to the Products and/or services or other supply provided by or through foodora on the Platform.
* foodora is not responsible for the suitability of the Products for the specific purpose you intend to use them other than as set out in the Terms or in the description of the Products on the Platform. This does not affect your rights under the Finnish Product Liability Act (in Finnish: tuotevastuulaki).
* foodora is not responsible for unauthorised access to, or modification of, information that you submit to foodora, or material or information that you receive. Furthermore, foodora is not responsible for criminal acts committed using foodora's services such as threats or slander, or for any obscenity or disruptive, abusive, inappropriate, or illegal content or behaviour by any user.
* foodora is not responsible for any direct or indirect damage caused by your use of the Platform, the services or by information from foodora. However, this does not apply if foodora caused you any harm intentionally or through gross negligence.
* foodora reserves the right to suspend or cancel its services and/or the delivery of one or more Products or services if the Customer has entered insufficient or incorrect information when registering the account, if foodora’s Partner is unable to complete the order, or in case of force majeure events such as epidemics and pandemics, including but not limited to Covid-19, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, political unrest, strike, lockout, blockades or any other labor disturbance, fire, accident or other circumstances beyond foodora’s reasonable control, or any other circumstances that substantially impedes or impairs the conditions for a delivery to be fulfilled. foodora undertakes to notify the Customer as soon as possible of whether a delivery may be delayed, or not delivered at all (in the event of no delivery, the full amount of the order will be refunded).

  
  

**13\. Applicable law and disputes**
------------------------------------

  
  
Disputes concerning the interpretation or application of these Terms shall be interpreted in accordance with Finnish law.  
  
In case of any dispute between foodora and the customer, the parties shall as a first step strive to resolve the dispute by agreement. If the parties cannot agree, the customer may defer the dispute to the Finnish Consumer Disputes Board (in Finnish: kuluttajariitalaukunta) at [www.kuluttajariita.fi](http://www.kuluttajariita.fi/).  
  
Before taking the matter to the Finnish Consumer Disputes Board, the customer should contact the Finnish Consumer Advisory Service (in Finnish: kuluttajaneuvonta) at [www.kuluttajaneuvonta.fi](http://www.kuluttajaneuvonta.fi/).  
  
If you are a customer resident in the EU, you also have the right to use the European Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform provided by the European Commission to resolve any dispute. The ODR platform can be found [here](http://ec.europa.eu/odr).
