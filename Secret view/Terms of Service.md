25-07-2023

Welcome to Secret View! These terms and conditions are meant to guide and govern the access to and use of the services of Secret View via the platform ([https://platform.secretview.io](https://platform.secretview.io/)) and the mobile application and all its content.

Secret View is part of Secret Collect B.V. (Velperplein 23, 6811 AH, Arnhem, The Netherlands). In these terms and conditions, Secret View is referred to by “Secret View”, “we” and “us”, and we refer to you as user of our platform as “you”, “mystery shopper” and/or “Community Approver”. By “platform” we refer in these terms and conditions to both Secret View’s website that is only accessible by creating an account ([https://platform.secretview.io](https://platform.secretview.io/)), and the mobile application.
