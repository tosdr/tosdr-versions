[](https://donotpay.com/learn/)Terms of Service

#### **Terms of Service**

LAST UPDATED: April 20, 2024

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. 

**Section 24 of these Terms contains an arbitration agreement and class action waiver that apply to all claims brought against DoNotPay, Inc in the United States. Please read them carefully.**

**1\. Introduction and Overview**
=================================

Welcome! Thanks for using the DoNotPay website (“Service”). The Service is provided by DoNotPay, Inc ("DoNotPay"), with a mailing address located at 440 Monticello Avenue, Ste 1802, PMB 33301, Norfolk, VA 23510, United States. By using our Service, you agree to these terms and conditions (“Terms”). Please read them carefully. Our goal is to level the playing field and make legal help accessible to the most vulnerable in society. At any time, DoNotPay may change these Terms by updating this posting, or emailing you at the email address you provided. You should visit this posting to review these Terms from time to time. In these Terms, references to DoNotPay include its parents, affiliates, directors and employees.

**2\. Who Can Use The Service**
===============================

The Service is available to anyone who is eighteen (18) years of age and older, has a valid email address, a valid credit card, and has enrolled in the Service at DoNotPay.com. We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service or cancel your account at any time for any reason.

**3\. What We Promise**
=======================

We have a direct relationship with you, our customer. As a result, we will never sell or rent your personal data. We also commit to never sell or rent anonymized user data.

**4\. Service Guarantees**
==========================

From time to time, if we detect that your purchase was not shipped in the time and manner that the merchant promised you, we may offer to correspond with the merchant on your behalf, and attempt to obtain a refund or other benefit for you.  In order to receive a benefit, your purchase must meet the merchant’s policy requirements.  This service may not be available at all times, but if we offer it to you, it will be provided free of charge unless we notify you otherwise.  If you accept our offer to provide this service, you agree that you will accept any resolution we obtain as final.

**5\. Merchants**
=================

DoNotPay is not affiliated with the Merchants from which we seek refunds and other benefits. Merchants' policies vary widely, and some policies only provide refunds on certain items. DoNotPay does not own or control Merchants’ customer satisfaction policies, which may change at any time. For convenience, we list each Merchants' policy in the Merchant section of our website, which we will update from time to time as policy changes come to our attention. For the most current version of a Merchant's policy, please refer to the Merchant's website. DoNotPay is not responsible for the Merchants’ actions, interpretation, and/or application of their policies, or their failure to issue a refund or other resolution that you believe is owed. DoNotPay may change its list of eligible Merchants at any time.

**6\. DoNotPay is Not a Law Firm**
==================================

DoNotPay provides a platform for legal information and self-help. The information provided by DoNotPay along with the content on our website related to legal matters ("Legal Information") is provided for your private use and does not constitute advice. We do not review any information you provide us for legal accuracy or sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, provide opinions about your selection of forms, or apply the law to the facts of your situation.

If you need advice for a specific problem, you should consult with a licensed attorney. As DoNotPay is not a law firm, please note that any communications between you and DoNotPay may not be protected under the attorney-client privilege doctrine.

**7\. Your DoNotPay Account and Linked Account**
================================================

When you create an account for the Service (“DoNotPay Account”), you agree that you will not use a username or email address for your DoNotPay Account or a Linked Account that belongs to someone else, impersonates someone else, violates another’s intellectual property rights, or is offensive in DoNotPay’ discretion. You agree to provide true, current and complete registration information about yourself, and to update this information promptly when it changes or upon our request.

You represent that your Linked Account belongs to you, and you are permitted to link to it.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your DoNotPay Account and are responsible for all activities that occur under your DoNotPay Account and Linked Account, whether or not you authorized the activity. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your DoNotPay Account or other breach of security.

You cannot sell, transfer, or assign your DoNotPay Account to someone else without our express written consent.

You represent that any dispute or request submitted is an authentic problem you are having. You are responsible for any damages to DoNotPay or others from disputes with fake or inauthentic information, or from reselling our services. Specifically, you must have a good faith basis for believing any piece of information or personal detail you provide to DoNotPay. You may not use any part of our website or intellectual property if you have been notified that you are not permitted to do so ("Ban Notification"). You may receive a Ban Notification through an automated DoNotPay system, by email to the address on file (from support@donotpay.com) or from a message from a DoNotPay employee.

**8\. Privacy**
===============

Our use of your DoNotPay Account, Linked Account, and all data and personal information contained therein is governed by our Privacy Policy.

**9\. Termination of the Service**
==================================

You may terminate your DoNotPay Account at any time by emailing support@donotpay.com from the email that you used to initially sign up. In the event that you need to cancel an account linked to a phone number, you agree to email your request to [support@donotpay.com](mailto:support@donotpay.com/), with the phone number on your account that you used to initially sign up. We may suspend your DoNotPay Account or terminate the Service if you violate any of these Terms.

**10\. Electronic Communications**
==================================

By entering into this Agreement you agree to receive text messages from us at the phone number you supplied when registering for an account and any updated phone number you associate with your account. You understand and agree that these texts may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other automated technologies. These messages may include but are not limited to: operational communications concerning your account or use of our services, as well as marketing content such as information about new products and special promotions run by us or our third-party partners. Standard text messaging rates will apply. Your agreement to receive texts is not a condition of any purchase.

If you wish to opt out of text messages, reply "STOP" to any text message you received, or contact customer service at support@donotpay.com. You may continue to receive text messages while we process your request.

**11\. Customer Service**
=========================

You may contact Customer Service using the contact information on our Site. The provision of customer support is not required or guaranteed, and is provided at DoNotPay’s sole discretion.

**12\. Laws and Regulations**
=============================

Your use of the Service is subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.  Unauthorized use of the Service is prohibited, and violators can be prosecuted under federal and state laws. Virginia law and Federal law will govern the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms.

**13\. Copyright and Trademark Information**
============================================

The information contained at the Site and provided as part of the Service, including all text and images (other than certain images of third parties) and their arrangement, are copyright DoNotPay Co. DoNotPay and its logo are trademarks of DoNotPay. All other trademarks are property of DoNotPay unless otherwise designated or clearly implied herein as belonging to third parties. Except as stated in the next paragraph, nothing at the Site or in the Service shall be construed as granting by implication, estoppel, or otherwise any license or right under any patent, trademark, copyright or proprietary rights of DoNotPay or of any third party.

You are authorized by DoNotPay to use the Service as described in these Terms solely for your personal, non-commercial use. The information and materials provided through the Service may not otherwise be copied, transmitted, displayed, distributed, downloaded, licensed, modified, published, posted, reproduced, used, sold, transmitted, used to create a derivative work or otherwise used for commercial or public purposes without DoNotPay’ prior written consent.

The Service materials may contain other proprietary notices and copyright information, the terms of which must be observed and followed. Certain images and information are the copyright or trademark of third parties and any use is subject to the terms and conditions of such third parties.

**14\. Digital Millennium Copyright Act**
=========================================

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you believe someone is violating your copyright on our Site, you can notify us following the instructions in our Legal section.

**15\. Limitation of Liabilities and Warranties**
=================================================

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

The Service may include technical or typographical inaccuracies and errors. DoNotPay assumes no liability for any errors or omissions in the information contained in the Service and expressly disclaims any responsibility to update this information.

IN NO EVENT SHALL DoNotPay BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE FORM OF ANY ACTION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONTRACT AND TORT ACTIONS (INCLUDING LIBEL), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, COPYING OR DISPLAY OF, OR THE INTERACTION OR ANY OTHER FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITH, THE SERVICE AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED AT THE SITE (INCLUDING VIA COMPUTER VIRUSES OR ANY OTHER FORM OF SOFTWARE).

**16\. Indemnification**
========================

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless DoNotPay from and against any and all losses and threatened losses arising from, in connection with, or based on allegations whenever made of, any of the following: your breach of these Terms, your use of the Service, any claim that your use of the Service violates any applicable law, or any claim arising out of your negligent acts or omissions. This obligation will survive any termination of these terms or your DoNotPay Account. You will cooperate fully as reasonably required in defense of any claim identified under this section. You acknowledge that damages from improper use of the Service may be irreparable; therefore, DoNotPay is entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to all other remedies. DoNotPay reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.

**17\. How the Airline/Hotel Service Works**
============================================

We provide our Service automatically by tracking customer policies and applicable laws at popular online websites. Where we see a potential savings or refund opportunity based on your purchase history, we will interact with Merchants on your behalf using your details to attempt to get you the benefit. This process may include the automatic cancellation and repurchasing of the ticket or service. You authorize DoNotPay to act as your agent in performing the Service.

By registering for the Service, you may be required to link your personal email account, such as Google (“Linked Accounts”), to the Service.

In order to identify savings opportunities for you, we will review the contents of your Linked Accounts, including receipts, correspondence, and contact information.

**18\. Links to Other Internet Web Sites**
==========================================

Some of the Web sites listed as links herein are not under the control of DoNotPay, but rather are exclusively controlled by third parties. Accordingly, DoNotPay makes no representations whatsoever concerning such Web sites. Although DoNotPay may provide a link to a third party, such a link is not an authorization, endorsement, sponsorship or affiliation by DoNotPay with respect to such Web site, its owners or its providers. DoNotPay is providing these links only as a convenience to you. DoNotPay has not tested any information, products or software found on such Web sites and therefore cannot make any representations whatsoever with respect thereto. It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature.

IN NO EVENT WILL DONOTPAY BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY USE OF ANY HYPERLINKED WEB SITE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR OTHER DATA ON YOUR INFORMATION HANDLING SYSTEM OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE ARE EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**19\. Feedback**
=================

Any comments or materials sent to DoNotPay or posted on the Site, including feedback data, such as questions, comments, suggestions or the like regarding the content of any such documents (collectively "Feedback"), shall be deemed to be the property of DoNotPay. DoNotPay’ use of the Feedback will be in compliance with our Privacy Policy, which is set forth on the Site, and applicable laws. DoNotPay shall have no additional obligations with respect to such Feedback and shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, exhibit, display, transform, create derivative works and distribute the Feedback to others without limitation. Further, DoNotPay shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such Feedback for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to developing, manufacturing and marketing products incorporating such Feedback.

**20\. Violations of Terms**
============================

DoNotPay reserves the right to seek all remedies available at law and in equity for violations of these Terms, including the right to block access from a particular Internet address to the Site. YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS DoNotPay FROM ANY LIABILITY, LOSS, CLAIM AND EXPENSE, INCLUDING ATTORNEY’S FEES, RELATED TO YOUR VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AND INFORMATION PROVIDED AT THE SITE.

**21\. About These Terms**
==========================

If there is any inconsistency between these Terms and any additional terms we may add, the additional terms will prevail. These terms govern the relationship between DoNotPay and you. They do not create any third-party beneficiary rights. If you do not comply with these Terms and we do not take action immediately, this does not mean we are forfeiting any rights that we may have. We may still take action in the future. If any particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other Terms.

**22\. Paid Services**
======================

DoNotPay may offer Services to be paid for on a recurring basis (“Subscription Services”) or on an as-used basis (“A La Carte Services” and, together with the Subscription Services, “Paid Services”). DoNotPay has the right to change, delete, discontinue or impose conditions on Paid Services or any feature or aspect of a Paid Service. Subscription Services may subject you to recurring fees and/or terms. By signing up for a Subscription Service, including after any free trial period, you agree to pay us the subscription fee and any applicable taxes as set forth in your DoNotPay Account settings or as otherwise agreed in writing (“Subscription Fee”). If you sign up for Subscription Services for a period (“Initial Period”), then the terms will be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Period at our then-current fee for such Subscription Services. In order to avoid automatic renewal, you must cancel your Subscription Services at least 2 calendar days (48 hours) prior to the automatic renewal date. You may cancel Paid Services online in account settings.

23\. Recouping Payments and Additional Contributions
====================================================

DoNotPay requires ACH bank account access or payment details for three reasons:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. To send you any money reclaimed from corporations and governments.
2. To process any payments made in the app, including your subscription to DoNotPay.
3. To process any external government/corporation fees to help you complete your task. For example, if you ask DoNotPay to pay your parking ticket for you, it will debit the cost of paying the parking ticket from your connected account. DoNotPay will always secure permission in writing from you before debiting any external fees.

We will recoup payment directly from your connected account. By using our services, you authorize us to initiate debit and credit entries to your bank account, or if you link a debit card to your account, you authorize us to charge your debit card, for all payments due to us. You agree to maintain a balance that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate. If the balance is insufficient, you authorize us to recoup payment from your connected account over nominal increments. However, DoNotPay will attempt to avoid charging your bank account if we believe your bank account does not contain sufficient funds to cover payment.

Our failure to charge your bank account for repayment within a set amount of time does not constitute a waiver of our right to charge your account for such funds. You represent and warrant that you have the right to authorize us to charge your account for payments due to us under these Terms. You will indemnify and hold DoNotPay harmless from any claims by any other owner of the account.

DoNotPay’s authorization to initiate debit and credit entries to your bank account will remain in full force and effect until you revoke your authorization. If you wish to revoke your authorization, you may do so by contacting support@DoNotPay.com at least three business days before the day a transaction is scheduled. Please note that your revocation of authorization when transactions are pending could result in delays to your receipt of funds and additional charges owed by you to DoNotPay. You are responsible for any costs or damages related to the timing of authorization revocation.

DoNotPay is not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or similar charges) that result from your failure to maintain a balance or available credit in the bank account that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate.

In order to allow you to use certain Services, we may be required to verify your identity. You authorize us to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity. These inquiries may include asking you for further information, requiring you to provide a taxpayer identification number, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments, ordering a credit report, or verifying information you provide against third party databases or through other sources. If you do not provide this information or we cannot verify your identity, we can decline to allow you to use the Services.

**24.** **United States Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement**
======================================================================

**24.1 Application****.** This Arbitration Agreement only applies to you if your country of residence or establishment is the United States. If your country of residence or establishment is not the United States, and you nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim against DoNotPay in the United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for determination of the threshold issue of whether this Section 24 applies to you, and all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law.

**24.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process****.** DoNotPay is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom this Section 24 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with DoNotPay’s customer service team (described in paragraph 24.3, below), and if necessary (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”). You and DoNotPay each retain the right to seek resolution of the dispute in small claims court as an alternative to arbitration.

**24.3 Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification****.** At least 15 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and DoNotPay each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution. You must send your notice of dispute to DoNotPay by mailing it to DoNotPay’s agent for service, located at 440 Monticello Avenue, Ste 1802, PMB 33301, Norfolk, VA 23510, United States. DoNotPay will send its notice of dispute to the address associated with your DoNotPay account. A notice of dispute must include: the party’s name and preferred contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the relief sought. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 15-day period, only then may either party commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf)) with the AAA and providing a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/)).

**24.4 Agreement to Arbitrate.** **You and DoNotPay mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or any use of the DoNotPay Platform, or any Content (collectively, “**Disputes**”) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the “**Arbitration Agreement**”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and DoNotPay agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.**

**24.5 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law****.** This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by the arbitrator in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the “**AAA Rules**“) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). In order to initiate arbitration, a completed written demand (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/)) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA rules.

**24.6 Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location****.** In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, DoNotPay agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the U.S. county where you reside; (b) in San Francisco County; (c) via phone or video conference.

**24.7 Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs****.** Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules. Either party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the AAA Rules.

**24.8 Arbitrator’s Decision****.** The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.

**24.9 Jury Trial Waiver****.** You and DoNotPay acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.

**24.10 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings****.** You and DoNotPay acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding. Unless we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.

**24.11 Severability****.** Except as provided in Section 24.10, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect.

**24.12 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate****.** If DoNotPay changes this Section 24 after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject that change by sending us written notice to 440 Monticello Avenue, Ste 1802, PMB 33301, Norfolk, VA 23510, United States, within 30 days of the date the change is effective. Rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and DoNotPay (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and DoNotPay.

**24.13 Survival****.** This section will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the DoNotPay Platform or terminate your DoNotPay account.
