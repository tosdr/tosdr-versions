**Last Updated:** March 2021

### INTRODUCTION

When you visit or access the [mentalfloss.com](https://www.mentalfloss.com/) websites and mobile device software applications (including, without limitation, if you open an email we have delivered to you), including on [mentalfloss.com](https://www.mentalfloss.com/) and any other product or service that links to this policy (together, the “Service”), we may use (and authorize third parties to use) web beacons, cookies, pixel tags, scripts, tags, API and other technologies ("Tracking Technologies"). This is explained in this policy (“Cookie Policy”) which is a part of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.mentalfloss.com/privacy-policy).

Tracking Technologies allow us to automatically collect information about you and your online behavior in order to enhance your navigation on our Service, improve our Service performance and customize your experience on it. We also use this information to collect statistics about the usage of our Service, perform analytics, serve ads, and to administer services to our users, customers and partners.

### WHAT ARE COOKIES?

Cookies are a commonly used tracking technology, comprised of small text files (composed only of letters and numbers) that a web server places on your computer or mobile device when you visit a webpage. When used, the cookie can help make our Services more user friendly, for example by remembering your language preferences and settings. You can find more information about cookies at [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work in an efficient way. The use of cookies allows you to navigate between pages efficiently. Cookies remember your preferences, and make the interaction between you and the Services smoother and more efficient.

WHY USE TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?  
There are five main purposes for using Tracking Technologies:

* **Strictly necessary Tracking Technologies**  
    These Tracking Technologies are essential to enable you to login, navigate around and use the features of our Services, or to provide a service requested by you (such as your username). These Tracking Technologies can be used for security and integrity reasons for example to detect violation of our policies and for support or security features.  
      
    

* **Functionality Tracking Technologies**  
    These Tracking Technologies allow our Services to remember choices you make (such as your language) and provide enhanced and personalized features. For example, these Tracking Technologies are used for authentication (to remember when you are loggedin) and support other features of our Services.  
      
    

* **Performance Tracking Technologies**  
    These Tracking Technologies collect information about your online activity (for example the duration of your visit on our Services), including behavioral data and content engagement metrics. These Tracking Technologies are used for analytics, research and to perform statistics (based on aggregated information).  
      
    

* **Marketing or Advertising Tracking Technologies**  
    These Tracking Technologies are used to deliver tailored offers and advertisements to you, based on your derived interests, as well as to perform email marketing campaigns. They can also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by our advertising partners and provide them insights about the people who see and interact with their ads, visit their websites or use their app.  
      
    

* **Social media Tracking Technologies**  
    These Tracking Technologies include social media features, such as the Facebook "Like" or "Share" buttons, or third party login services. These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing these features.

### STORING TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

We store Tracking Technologies when you visit or access our Services. These are called "First Party Tracking Technologies". In addition, Tracking Technologies are stored by other third parties (for example our analytics service providers, business partners and advertisers) – these are called "Third Party Tracking Technologies".

Both types of Tracking Technologies may be stored either for the duration of your visit on our Services or for repeat visits.

### HOW TO MANAGE YOUR COOKIE SETTINGS

There are various ways in which you can manage and control your cookie settings. Please remember that, by deleting or blocking cookies, some of the features of the Services may not work properly or as effectively.
