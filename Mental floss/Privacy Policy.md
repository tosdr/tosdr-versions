**d. Job Candidates from the EU and Canada**  

* Personal Data of Job candidates who apply for any of our and our affiliated companies’ open jobs in the EU (“**Candidates**”), is also subject to this Policy, and in addition, to the terms specifically provided in this section, which shall prevail over the rest of the terms of this Policy in case of inconsistency. Within an application of a Candidate, we may collect certain Personal Data about the Candidate, as provided by the Candidate, such as: resume, contact details, occupation data and other related information (“**Candidate Data**”).

* Our main management and retention platform provider for Candidate Data is Comeet Technologies Inc. (“**Comeet**”). Candidates are welcome to review Comeet’s privacy notice at:  
    ‍[https://help.comeet.com/en/articles/3134994-privacy-notice](https://help.comeet.com/en/articles/3134994-privacy-notice).  
    Candidates should not apply for a job and provide us with their Personal Data, unless they have read and agreed to this Policy and Comeet’s privacy notice.

* A Candidate may also apply for a position via third parties (such as: LinkedIn, Glassdoor, placement companies, etc.), who may provide us with Candidate’s Personal Data on Candidate’s behalf. Any Personal Data that we receive via from such third parties may be subject to this Policy, but each Candidate is requested to review the privacy policies of such third parties (of which we do not assume any liability for) prior to providing us with any Personal Data via their services.

* We aim to protect the privacy of Candidate Data and use such data solely for our and our affiliated companies’ internal recruitment purposes (inter alia, for contacting the Candidates, evaluating them for a specific position, etc.). In case a Candidate provides a reference, certain necessary relevant Candidate Data may be inevitably revealed to such reference in the process of a reference check (e.g., the fact that Candidate is searching for a new job, and any other relevant information included in Candidate’s resume, etc.), and thus a Candidate should not provide a reference in case Candidate does not wish such information to be disclosed.

* We retain Candidate Data within Comeet for no longer than thirty six (36) months after the last activity was made in relation to a Candidate on Comeet, unless the Candidate has provided consent for a longer period of retention. Resumes, and Candidate Data provided to us via other means, may be retained in other systems for longer periods, subject to the general retention framework specified in this Policy under the “Retention” section below. The purpose of retaining Candidate Data is to enable us to contact a Candidate who we find suitable in order to inform the Candidate of a new job vacancy, and in order to use such data in case the Candidate contacts us again and applies for the same or a different position.
