You shall be held liable to any damages or losses incurred by us as a result of intellectual property infringement through the User Content, including payment of damages and statutory damages resulting from contributory or direct (meaning, even in the event that the content was edited and re-published by us) infringement.

### 9\. Notice and Takedown Policy

We take copyright infringement very seriously, and we are committed to comply with the applicable copyright and intellectual property legislation. As a result, and in accordance with applicable laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we have a Notice & Takedown mechanism, designed to enable copyright owners to report an infringement within the Service. We reserve the right (inter alia) to (1) block access to or remove content that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, clients, content providers, contributors, members or users; and/or (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.

If you believe that works, material or content residing on or accessible through our Service, infringes your copyright, or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of (collectively, alleged “**Infringing Content**”), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to our designated agent (our “**Designated Agent**”, whose contact details are listed below): The identity (including registration/identification number) of the notifier; The identity of the copyright violator, e.g. username/name (if known); Date of notification; A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed (or of the owner himself); Identification of the works, material or content claimed to be infringed; Identification of the alleged Infringing Content, including information regarding its location, with sufficient details so that we can find and verify its existence (including screen shots and links); Contact information about the notifier, including email and physical address, and also related website/URL (if applicable) and jurisdiction; A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the alleged Infringing Content identified is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; And, a statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifier is authorized to make the complaint as the owner of the relevant works, material or content claimed to be infringed, or on behalf of its copyright owner.

Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to (at our discretion): Remove or disable access to the alleged Infringing Content; Notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the alleged Infringing Content; And/or, terminate such content provider’s access to our Service, if we determine that he or she is a repeat offender.

If we notified the content provider as aforesaid, and he or she believes that the alleged Infringing Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such content, then the content provider may promptly send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent: Physical or electronic signature of the content provider; Identification of the alleged Infringing Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled (including screen shots and links); A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the alleged Infringing Content was unjustifiably removed or disabled, such as a result of mistake or misidentification of the content, and an explanation as to the aforesaid; And content provider’s name, physical address and email.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, we may, at our discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that we may reinstate the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. In such case, unless we are informed that the copyright owner filed an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be reinstated or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our discretion.

Please contact our Designated Agent at the following address:

Attn. Legal Department, Pro Sportority (Israel) Ltd./Minute Media

### 10\. Cross Platform Publication

When you upload User Content you agree and acknowledge that we may display the content in any part of the Service we see fit, regardless of the part of the Service to which you uploaded your User Content ("Cross Platform Publication"). For example, we may choose to publish User Content which you posted on the Website on the Facebook Application. You agree and acknowledge that you are not entitled to any notification of or compensation due to Cross Platform Publication of your User Content at any time. In addition we may choose to post information regarding your use of the Service on your social media profile wall (e.g. Facebook), including your User Content, statuses, comments, vBets and content you have read.
