​

Governing Law.  These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, United States of America without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles.

In the event a Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after submission, you or AdBridg may institute arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section.

​

Dispute Resolution.  Any and all Disputes that cannot be resolved through informal resolution as set forth above shall be resolved exclusively through final, binding and confidential arbitration and shall take place in Santa Clara, California unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under the arbitration rules in effect at the time such dispute is submitted (the "Rules"), provided that the arbitrator and the parties shall comply with the following: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding, final, and confidential, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

YOUR NOTICE MUST INCLUDE: (I) YOUR FULL NAME (FIRST AND LAST); (II) YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS OR OTHER PREFERRED METHOD OF CONTACT; AND (III) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DECLINE THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.

​

Exception to Arbitration.  Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate any of AdBridg's intellectual property rights, AdBridg may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court with competent jurisdiction in any country, including in the State of California, United States of America, without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute process set forth in this Section, and you hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and exclusive venue in such courts.

​

No Class Actions.  YOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ADBRIDG ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS AREN'T ALLOWED UNDER THESE TERMS.

​

Venue.  In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and AdBridg agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, and the parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.

​

Time Limitation to Bring Claims.  Notwithstanding any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Site the Tool and/or Content must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, otherwise that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.

​

​

##### 14\. GENERAL

​

Entire Agreement  
The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and AdBridg, and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements or communications with regard to the subject matter described herein. Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under these Terms are assignable by you, and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void and without effect. The official text of these Terms (and any notice submitted hereunder) will be in English. The parties acknowledge that they require that these Terms be drawn up in the English language only. In the event of any dispute concerning the construction or meaning of these Terms, reference will be made only to these Terms as written in English and not to any translation into another language.

​

Waiver  
You agree that if AdBridg does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which AdBridg has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of AdBridg's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to AdBridg. No waiver by either party of any breach of any provision hereof shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent or prior breach of the same or any other provision.

​

Severability  
If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.
