### **The Type of Data We Collect**

The application collects data to operate effectively and to furnish or enhance your experience with our products. You will not have to provide any personal information such as name, contact information, payment data or demographics when using our products. Nevertheless, while using the products, we will record data pertaining to your interaction with our products such as device performance, location, cellular quality, Wi-Fi and internet quality. This is so as ensure best performance and quality of the service provided. The data is collected and kept hashed and anonymized and is statistically processed to prevent tracking individual details.

You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide acceptance to permissions, you may decline. However, if you choose not to provide permissions that are crucial for the provision a service or a feature, you may not be able to use that service or feature or its performance may be degraded.

### **Location Information**

We collect details about your current location both when the application is visible and, if permission is granted, when in the background. This information is used to find access points near you, help guide you to their locations and aids us in identifying and connecting to those points. You may decline permission for background access to location. However, this will severely limit the ability of the application to find and connect to optimal points.

### **How We Use Collected Data**

We only collect data required for products functionality. Before or at the time of collecting information, we clearly identify the purpose or purposes for which the information is being collected.

We collect and use information solely for the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by product functionality and compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.

We will collect information by permissions and lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge and consent of the individual concerned.

The data collected will be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, will be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

### **How We Protect Your Data**

We use commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event of any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take all reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate, to notify what information may have been compromised, and to take such action as may be required by applicable laws and regulations.

We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.

We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.

In addition to other information described in this policy, we may collect and share with third party ad and data networks precise location information. This location information may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with mobile identifiers (such as IDFAs and Android IDs), and shared with third parties for purposes related to advertising, analytics, attribution (e.g., measuring ad performance), analytics and market research. You can remove your consent to having your location data collected by changing the settings on your device. (Certain services may lose functionality as a result.) You can “opt out” of various third party uses of Apple’s and Android’s advertising identifiers through those platforms’ corresponding device settings, as well.
