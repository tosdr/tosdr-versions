Thumbzilla does not sell, nor has it sold in the past twelve (12) months personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. We may however disclose certain personal information with third parties, service providers and entities within our corporate group to enable them to perform certain services on our behalf, and namely to make Thumbzilla function properly, as further described in the section above titled _Disclosure of Your Personal Information_.  

We respect California residents’ right to exclude personal information from such sharing arrangements and grant them the option to opt-out of any future sale of their personal information.

You can designate an agent to make a request by executing a notarized power of attorney to have that person act on your behalf and providing that person with the information listed above that allows us to verify your identity and locate your information. Alternatively, you will need to directly confirm your identity with us using the methods described above, sign an authorization for the agent to act on your behalf and provide us with confirmation that you have done so.

Transfers of Your Personal Information to Other Countries
---------------------------------------------------------

We may share the information we collect globally, across our corporate group and with our service providers and other third parties. Transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including our operation and provision of the services stated in our Terms of Service and this Privacy Notice to fix, analyse, and improve our website, products and services. Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside the EEA and other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice, as permitted by the applicable laws and based on appropriate mechanisms. 

Where applicable, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA.  

In other situations, we rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (and the equivalent standard contractual clauses for the UK, where appropriate) or on derogations provided for under the applicable law to transfer information to a third country. 

For more information or to obtain a copy of our standard contractual clauses, please see the section “_Contact Information_” below on how to contact us. 

Retention of Personal Information
---------------------------------

We will only retain your personal information for as long as your account is active, or for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we processed it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. 

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider several factors, including what personal data we are processing, the risk of harm from any unauthorized disclosure, why we are processing your personal data and whether we can achieve this outcome by another means without having to process it. 

Where we no longer need to process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, we will delete it from our systems.  

For more information on data retention periods, please see the section “_Contact Information_” below on how to contact us.  

Where permissible, we will also delete your personal information upon your request as explained above in the section _“Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information”_. 

Third-Party Links and Sites
---------------------------

If you click on a link to a third-party website, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of these websites. Read the Privacy Notice of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for these third-party practices.

Changes to Our Privacy Notice
-----------------------------

We may modify or revise our Privacy Notice from time to time. We may attempt to notify you of any material changes as required by law. Please also periodically review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Notice, which will be posted at this location, so you are aware of any changes, the date of change will be reflected in the “last modified date” mention.

Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information 
-------------------------------------------------

Subject to local law and applicable legal requirements and exemptions, you have certain rights regarding your personal data: 

* **Right of access**: you have the right to receive information on the personal data we hold about you and how such personal data is used, as well as a copy of your personal data; 
    
* **Right to rectification**: you have the right to rectify inaccurate personal data concerning you; 
    
* **Right to be forgotten**: you have the right to delete/erase your personal data; 
    
* **Right to data portability**: you have the right to receive the personal data provided by you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this personal data to another data controller; 
    
* **Right to object**: you have the right to object to the use of your personal data where such use is based on our legitimate interests or on public interests;  
    
* **Right to restriction of processing**: you have the right in some cases, to restrict our use of your personal data; and 
    
* **Right to file a complaint**: If you are in the EEA or the UK, you also have a right to file a complaint with your local data protection authority. 
    

If we ask for your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. Note that, in that case, you may no longer able to use several functionalities on Thumbzilla or access Thumbzilla in some cases. 

You can exercise your rights by sending us an e-mail at [support@thumbzilla.com](mailto:support@thumbzilla.com). Please note that we have one month to respond to your request.  

Prior to processing an access or deletion request of your data, we will need to verify your identity and ensure your right to access or delete the information. This is an appropriate and reasonable security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it or deleted in an unauthorized way.  

Please note that in some cases, we may not have sufficient information to identify you and therefore may not be able to satisfy your request. Additionally, in some cases, to adequately verify your identity or your authorization to make the request, we may require you to provide additional information. 

Copyright Policy
----------------

_Last Modified: August 17, 2023_

Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement
------------------------------------------

We take claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the **“DMCA”**) or any other applicable intellectual property legislation or laws. Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, terminating the user’s access to [www.thumbzilla.com](https://www.thumbzilla.com/) (**“Thumbzilla”**), or all of the foregoing.

If you believe any material accessible on Thumbzilla infringes your copyright, you may submit a copyright infringement notification (see below, “Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement” for instructions on filing such a notice). These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner, or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.

If we remove or disable access to material in response to such a notice, we will take reasonable steps to notify the user that uploaded the affected content material that we have removed or disabled access to so that the user has the opportunity to submit a counter notification (see below, “Counter-Notification Procedures” for instructions on filing a counter notification). It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act.

All copyright infringement notifications and counter-notifications must be written in English. Any attempted notifications written in foreign languages or using foreign characters may, at our discretion, be deemed non-compliant and disregarded.

Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement
----------------------------------------------

If you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, please remember that you are initiating a legal process. Do not make false claims. Misuse of this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.

You may notify Thumbzilla of alleged copyright infringement via our form found at [DMCA Takedown Form](https://thumbzilla.com/information#dmcaform). This form is designed to help you identify your content accurately and help speed up the process of content take-down.

We also accept free-form copyright infringement notifications. In that case, in accordance with the DMCA, the written notice (the **“DMCA Notice”**) must include substantially the following:

Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works, a representative list of such works.

Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material. If your complaint does not contain the specific URL of the video you believe infringes your rights, we may be unable to locate and remove it. General information about the video, such as a channel URL or username, is typically not adequate. Please include the URL(s) of the exact video(s).

Adequate information by which we, and the uploader(s) of any video(s) you remove, can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address).

A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Complete complaints require the physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a representative authorized to act on their behalf. To satisfy this requirement, you may type your full legal name to act as your signature at the bottom of your complaint.

Our designated copyright agent to receive DMCA Notices is:

Lawrence G. Walters

Walters Law Group

195 W. Pine Ave.

Longwood, FL 32750

Email: [copyright@aylofreesites.com](mailto:%20copyright@aylofreesites.com)

Please do not send other inquiries or requests to our designated copyright agent. Absent prior express permission, our designated copyright agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond that required to receive valid DMCA Notices or Counter-Notices (as defined below) is expressly disclaimed.

If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on Thumbzilla is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

The copyright owner’s name will be published on Thumbzilla in place of disabled content. This will become part of the public record of your DMCA Notice, along with your description of the work(s) allegedly infringed. All the information provided in a DMCA Notice, the actual DMCA Notice (including your personal information), or both may be forwarded to the uploader of the allegedly infringing content. By submitting a DMCA Notice, you consent to having your information revealed in this way.

Counter-Notification Procedures
-------------------------------

If you have received a DMCA Notice and believe that material you posted on Thumbzilla was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us (a “Counter-Notice”). Counter notifications must be submitted by the video’s original uploader, or an agent authorized to act on their behalf.

Counter-notices must be sent to our designated agent:

Lawrence G. Walters

Walters Law Group

195 W. Pine Ave.

Longwood, FL 32750

Email: [copyright@aylofreesites.com](mailto:%20copyright@aylofreesites.com)

Please do not send other inquiries or requests to our designated copyright agent. Absent prior express permission, our designated copyright agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond that required to receive valid DMCA Notices or Counter-Notices is expressly disclaimed.

Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter-Notice must include substantially the following:

* Your name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature;
    
* Identification of the allegedly infringing content and its location before removal or access to it was disabled;
    
* A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the content was removed by mistake or misidentification; and
    
* A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are located (or if you are outside the U.S., for any judicial district in which the operator of Thumbzilla may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who originally provided us with the DMCA Notice or an agent of such person.
    

We will not respond to Counter-Notices that do not meet the requirements set out above.

After we receive your Counter Notice, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original DMCA Notice and inform that party that the removed material may be restored after ten (10) business days but no later than fourteen (14) business days from the date we received your Counter Notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party who filed the original DMCA Notice informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.

Please note that when we forward your Counter Notice, it will include your personal information. By submitting a counter notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter notification to any party other than the original claimant or to law enforcement or parties that assist us with enforcing and protecting our rights.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on Thumbzilla was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

Repeat Infringers
-----------------

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating or disabling, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. We may also at our sole discretion limit access to Thumbzilla, terminate or disable the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

Video Fingerprinting
--------------------

We use MediaWise®, an automated audiovisual identification system, to assist us in identifying and blocking potentially infringing content from being uploaded by users. Videos uploaded to Thumbzilla are compared against a database of digital fingerprints. When a video is matched to a digital fingerprint, access to it is disabled. If you are interested in having your content digitally fingerprinted by the provider of the automated audiovisual identification system we use, please contact Vobile Customer Support.

How the sorting of content works
--------------------------------

We want to make sure that you always see the content that you enjoy most. To enhance your user experience, we provide a variety of sorting options for you to choose from.

Where available, you can switch options in the upper right corner. Sorting can be based on how we recommend relevant content and on the following options, where applicable:

* **Homepage sorting:** Content on the homepage (HOME) is sorted based on the collective behavior of users to show videos that were watched and enjoyed. We also account for if you liked or watched a video, and what’s the hottest and trending content. If you don't want recommendations based on your viewed content, you can turn _Personalized Recommendations_ off on the hamburger menu.
    
* **Most recent and newest:** Content is sorted by publication date.
    
* **Most viewed:** Content is sorted by number of views. Where applicable, you can customize the relevant time frame and country for the views.
    
* **Top rated:** Content is sorted by the number of likes and dislikes. Where applicable, you can customize the relevant time frame for the ratings.
    
* **Longest:** Videos are sorted by length.
    
* **A-Z or alphabetical:** Content is sorted by name or title.
    
* **Most subscribed:** Content is sorted by number of subscriptions.
    
* **Number of videos:** Content is sorted by number of attributable videos.
    
* **Most popular:**
    
    * **Categories and Channels:** Content is sorted by number of views. Where applicable, you can customize the relevant time frame and country for the views.
        
    * **Pornstars, Models, and Community:** To determine the most popular content creators, we consider views, the number of times the pornstar or model is searched, and subscriptions.
        
* **Top trending or trending:**
    
    * **Pornstars and Models:** To determine the top trending content creators, we consider the popularity of a creator’s content within a specific time period.
        
* **Most relevant:** Most relevant content is shown based on keyword search results, such as matching tags, model and pornstar names, titles of content, and categories to the search entry. We also show newer content first, specifically content with more engagement.
    

  
More options on how you can customize our recommendations
------------------------------------------------------------

On the homepage for Thumbzilla, you can select the **Hamburger menu** icon, and you can turn on or off _Personalized Recommendations_. If you turn off this feature, the videos you watched and how you interacted with these videos don’t influence any content recommendations we show you.

Google Signals apply to Google users who accept personalized advertising on their Google accounts.
