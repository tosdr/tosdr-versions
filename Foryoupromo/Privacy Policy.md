Privacy policy
==============

**Last Updated: 6 March 20**21

This Privacy Policy applies to https://foryoupromo.com/ (the “Site”) and outlines our treatment of personally identifiable information we collect on behalf of our sponsors and for our own use. There are two categories of data processing in which MPP Media Pay Plus Ltd (“MPP”) is involved and collects such information to identify you as a participant and/or respondent to the Foryoupromo “opt-in” promotions.

Agreement to this Policy**:** By using this Site you consent to this Privacy Policy, including your consent to our use and disclosure of information about you in the manner described herein.

This Privacy Policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

**Foryoupromo ‘opt-in’ and ‘opt-out’ data processing**

Most of the times, MPP offers the opportunity to ‘opt-in’ to receiving marketing information from MPP and its partners/sponsors. In such events, an “opt-in” question will appear on the registration entry page clearly explaining to potential entrants that by checking the box the entrant will be agreeing to share their personally identifiable information with MPP and MPP’s named partners.

Such information may come from MPP itself, companies with whom MPP has a business relationship and/or MPP’s named sponsors/partners. If you want to ‘opt-out’ of receiving such notices from MPP after you have ‘opted-in’, or you wish to correct the information you have provided to MPP, you are invited to do this via e-mail to [\[email protected\]](https://foryoupromo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**Channel management**  

When you ‘opt-in’ to receive information from MPP, you are agreeing to receive email and information via other channels from MPP, including marketing, surveys, special offers and notices about other promotions. By ‘opting-in’ to the promotion you, as the respondent, consent to receive telephone calls for marketing purposes, even if you have provided your (mobile or landline) telephone number to a federal or state do-not-call register.

**What Personal Information do we collect?**

We collect whatever contact information you fill in on our promotional form. That includes: Title, First Name, Last Name, Zip Code, Address, City, State, Mobile Telephone Number, and Date of Birth.

**Information Sharing** We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties without first providing you notice and choice.

With Agents: We may provide your personal information to agents or service providers acting on our behalf for limited purposes. For example, we may share personal information with our agents or service providers to enter you into our promotions or send you an email on our behalf. These third parties are authorized to use your personal information only to perform the service they are providing for us.

Additionally, when aligned, we also share postal data including name and address with third-party advertisers for direct mail marketing. 

By Law: We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or similar legal process served on our website) and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, and/or respond to a government request.

Business Transition: In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
