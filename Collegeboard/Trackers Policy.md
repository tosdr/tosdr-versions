Cookies and Website Usage
=========================

Like most websites, our systems gather certain information automatically. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., webpages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. This information is used to analyze usage trends in the aggregate and administer and improve the site.

We use cookies to remember your settings. This makes browsing more efficient on subsequent visits by using your preferences to customize the content and/or layout of our site(s). You can use your browser to control the use of cookies.

Cookies and other technologies such as beacons, pixels, tags, and scripts are used by College Board for analytics in analyzing trends, administering and improving the site, tracking users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base. We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Adobe Analytics, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the sites and understand more about the demographics of our users. You can learn more about Adobe’s practices at [Adobe Experience Cloud privacy](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/experience-cloud.html).

This Privacy Statement covers the use of cookies by College Board only and does not cover the use of cookies by our business partners. We do not control or supervise how third-party sources process your personal information, and any request that you have regarding the disclosure of your personal information should be made directly to those third parties. Data that may be collected through these channels include, for example, IP address, access times, browser type and language, device type, and device identifiers.

**Cookie Controls:** Most web browsers provide controls that let you block or delete cookies. Generally, you can go to your browser’s Help section and see instructions for blocking or deleting cookies. However, certain features College Board uses on its site depend on cookies. If you turn off your cookie settings you can still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

**Third Parties and Online Advertising:** We do not display any advertising on our site. If you sign up to receive information about College Board programs, we may use third parties, such as Facebook, to provide information about our educational programs and services. Only hashed, non-identifiable information is provided to these third parties. We do not share personally identifiable information with any of these platforms, and they can only use what limited data we share to provide services to us. You can opt out of these communications in your account settings page at [my.collegeboard.org/profile](http://my.collegeboard.org/profile) by clicking on **Subscriptions**.

When you visit certain pages on our website, such as BigFuture, we use marketing pixels to record information about the user's browsing session including the URL viewed, which is sent to third parties such as Facebook (or similar platform). No personal information is contained in or collected as a result of using these pixels.

When we share usage data from our site with marketing partners to improve the efficiency and quality of our advertising, the data that is shared is anonymous.

For more information about interest-based advertising and how you can opt out from some of it, visit the [NAI Consumer Opt Out](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) page or the [Digital Advertising Alliance Your Ad Choices site](https://youradchoices.com/). You can also manage certain advertising cookies by visiting the EU-based [Your Online Choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/) and [the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/) site. You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt out of interest-based ads” (Android). You may also be able to opt out of some, but not all, interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting [Your Ad App Choices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices). Please note that opting out of receiving interest-based advertising through NAI’s and DAA’s online resources will only opt out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but they may still receive interest-based ads on their other devices. You must opt out on each browser or device you use.

**YouTube:** We use the YouTube service to display videos related to our programs and services, such as college and career planning and opportunities and training for educators. YouTube uses tracking technologies, which may be present in the videos embedded on YouTube, which may collect information from your browser when you view the video, including device identifiers and/or cookie IDs. This information is collected directly and automatically by YouTube and its partners; College Board does not participate in these data transmissions. College Board does not provide any personally identifiable information, such as usernames, to YouTube. You can learn more about Google’s practices and control your settings on the service at [YouTube policies](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/user-settings/privacy/).
