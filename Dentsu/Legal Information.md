Dentsu is a global media, creative and customer experience management group made up of several brands. We help our clients to improve how they advertise and market, whether by print, post, email or in the digital world. We believe that the responsible use of data supports business growth and builds strong relationships between brand and consumer.

We are committed to being always transparent in our handling and processing of Personal Data in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws. 

**Who is responsible for processing your Personal Data?**

This may be through a contract we have in place with the importing company, or because we know that where the importing company is based has even stricter data protection laws than the one you are based in/ it was received in.

We take internal data protection very seriously. Our employees and the service companies commissioned by us have been contractually bound to treat personal data with appropriate confidentiality and to act in compliance with data protection regulations.

We will only disclose the information necessary to enable these third parties to perform their services. Our service providers are contracted to comply with our instructions. 

We might share information with third parties who help us with our marketing efforts, including social media platforms, advertising networks, and ad tech companies. For example, we may share email addresses or other contact information with social media platforms so they can serve our advertising to you on their platform. Personal data received by our partners may also be subject to their privacy policies and the tools they provide for you to manage how your Personal Data is used for advertising purposes.

_Group company transfers_

Dentsu International is a globally operating media group consisting of multiple companies. Therefore, we may from time to time disclose your Personal Data within our group of companies.

Where we transfer Personal Data between our group companies, we have covered these transfers by entering into an Intra-Group Data Transfer Agreement. This provides us with a mechanism to transfer Personal Data around the globe where necessary.

We may also disclose personal information with any successor to all or part of our business. For example, if part of our business is sold, we may give our customer list as part of that transaction.

_Information shared with other parties_ 

Where required or permitted by law, Personal Data may be provided to others, such as regulators and law enforcement agencies, for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or act regarding illegal activities, and as otherwise required by law. 

We may also collect Personal Data from the parties described in this section.

You may request further information on the measures used for such transfers via the contact details given in this Privacy Notice.

**6\. Your rights** 

Depending on the applicable privacy law of the market you are in, you may have several rights in relation to your Personal Data, including:

* **Objecting to our processing** **of your Personal Data.** Where we rely on legitimate interest (or those of a third-party) and if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms, you can object to our processing. You also have a right to object where your Personal Data is used for direct marketing or profiling. You can object at any time, and we shall stop processing the data you have objected to, unless we can show legitimate grounds to continue. 
* **Accessing your Personal Data**. We may be required to provide you with information we hold about you upon your request, including a description and copy of the Personal Data and why we are processing it, unless a lawful exception applies. We will require you to prove your identity before providing your Personal Data.
* **Requesting the provision of your Personal Data to a third party**. You may ask us to provide you or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This right only applies to Personal Data you have provided to us; and if you have consented to our use or where we used the Personal Data to perform a contract with you. 
* **Requesting erasure (deletion) of your Personal Data**.  You may ask us to delete your data where you think we no longer require it. Note, we may be required to retain certain Personal Data by law and/or for our own legitimate business purpose. But when we do so, we will inform you.
* **Requesting correction or updating of your Personal Data**. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Data we hold about you corrected. 
* **Requesting the restriction of our processing of your Personal Data.** In some situations and only in some jurisdictions you can request a restriction to our processing. If you request this, we can continue to store your Personal Data but are restricted from processing it while the restriction is in place.
* **Withdrawing your consent.** Where you have consented to our processing of your Personal Data, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of what we have done with your Personal Data before you withdrew consent or affect our right to continue with our collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Data where such collection, use or disclosure of Personal Data is permitted under applicable laws without consent. If you receive marketing communications from us, you can withdraw your consent to marketing by hitting the unsubscribe button contained within the email.
* **Making a Complaint.** We will do our best to resolve any complaint. However, if you feel we have not resolved your complaint, or if you wish to reach out to them directly, you can complain to your local data protection authority. For example, in the UK, the local data protection authority is the [UK Information Commissioner's Office.](https://ico.org.uk/) If you have any questions about who your local authority is, please contact us and we can provide the relevant information.
* **Opting out of marketing.** You may choose not to receive marketing communications from us. You can ask us to stop such messages at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the message.  Please note that even if you choose not to receive marketing communications from us, you still may receive non-marketing communications, such as responses to your inquiries or notices regarding your account or our relationship with you.

If you exercise the rights above, the request should include your contact information and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. In addition, you should provide adequate information that we can reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected the personal information (including information that enables us to verify the identifying information we possibly maintain about you).

We will respond to requests within the required timeframes. If we need extra time to respond, we will let you know why, and how long we require, in writing. To protect your Personal Data, we will only honour requests if we have been able to verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. The method used to verify your identity will depend on the type, sensitivity and value of the information, including the risk of harm to you posed by any access or deletion. Verification will usually be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the personal information that we already have.

Note that if you are in a market where these rights do not exist, we reserve the right to deny your request.

**7\. Our responsibility for Personal Data collected through website links**

This privacy notice is limited to the Personal Data collected by us. We do provide links within our website(s) to other websites, including social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, or links to the sites of other dentsu entities.

This Privacy Notice includes certain disclosures required under applicable U.S. privacy laws.  Please note that the rules implementing some of these laws have not yet been finalized.  We are committed to continual compliance with these laws and will update our processes and this notice as the rules are finalized and the law requires.

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”), and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”) provides residents of their respective states with additional rights with respect to their personal data. Those rights are explained below in Your Privacy Rights.

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” (also known as “targeted advertising”) and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.

As noted above, in this Privacy Notice, the term “personal data” has the meaning ascribed to it under applicable U.S. laws, and includes the term “personal information” as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended.

In the table below we set out further information about the purposes for which we use your personal data and the categories of third parties that we disclose, “sell,” or share the personal data.  The term “share” has the meanings ascribed to it under applicable U.S. privacy laws, including for “cross-context behavioral advertising” or “targeted advertising.”  The term “sell” has the meanings ascribed to it under applicable U.S. laws, meaning the sale of your personal data to an outside party for monetary or other valuable consideration, subject to certain exceptions.  In the second column, we also specify how such personal data is categorized under applicable U.S. privacy laws.

For example, we may retain Personal Data as permitted by law, such as for tax or other record keeping purposes, to maintain an active account, and to process transactions and facilitate customer requests. Note that for purposes of these requests under this privacy notice, Personal Data does not include information we have collected as a service provider to our clients. Finally, please note that we are required by California Civil Code section 1798.105(d) to keep a record of your request.

Only you, or a person or business entity that you authorize to act on your behalf (an “authorized agent”), may make the requests set forth above. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.  For California residents, Authorized Agents must be a person or entity registered with the California Secretary of State.

The request should include your contact information and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. In addition, you should provide sufficient information (including information that reasonably enables us verify the identifying information we currently maintain about you) that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected the Personal Data or an authorized representative.

We will respond to consumer requests in a reasonably timely manner. If we require extra time to respond, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. In order to protect the security of your Personal Data, we will not honor a request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. The method used to verify your identity will depend on the type, sensitivity and value of the information, including the risk of harm to you posed by any authorized access or deletion. Generally speaking, verification will be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the personal information that we already have.

Any disclosures we provide for California residents will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request (and will not be made more than twice in a 12-month period). If we cannot comply with a request, or cannot fully comply with a request, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply. If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process.
