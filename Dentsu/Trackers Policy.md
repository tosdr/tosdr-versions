**Introduction**

Dentsu International (referred to as “**our**”, “**us**” and “**we**” in this notice) is a global media group. We help our clients to improve how they advertise and market, whether by print, post, email or on sites. We believe that the responsible use of data supports business growth and builds strong relationships between brand and consumer. As a business, we are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of all individuals with whom we interact. We are committed to being transparent in our handling and processing of personal data at all times in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.

This Cookie Notice explains how we use cookies and the choices you have. Except as otherwise stated in this notice, the relevant dentsu privacy notice, which can be found on our [privacy notice page](https://www.dentsu.com/our-policies/privacy-notices) ("Privacy Notice"), will apply to our processing of the data that we collect via cookies including your rights regarding your personal data.

**What are “cookies”?**

Cookies are small packets of information stored by your browser when you visit certain sites, including our site. Cookies are generally used by sites to improve your user experience by enabling that site to ‘remember’ you, either strictly for the duration of your visit (using a “Session” cookie which is erased when you close your browser) or for repeat visits (using a “Permanent” cookie). 

Please be advised that in some countries data such as cookie IDs and IP-/MAC- addresses are considered to be personal data. To the extent we process such data that is considered personal data, this will be done in accordance with our Privacy Notice.

**Third Parties and Information Sharing**

Our sites may include links to third party sites, plug-ins and applications. Using these facilities may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. Where you have opted-in to Functional Cookies, Performance Cookies and Targeting Cookies, it may be possible for third party sites to track your browsing behaviour when you leave our site. You are able to opt-out of these cookies at any time.  For more information on these cookies, you can access granular details relating to each of the cookies, the categories, descriptions, types (first or third party) and lifespans.

For help and advice on how to do this, please follow the instructions in the ‘How to reject cookies’ section below.

**Our site uses the following types of cookies:** 

_**Strictly Necessary Cookies**_ 

These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personal data.

_**Functional Cookies**_ 

These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.

_**Performance Cookies**_ 

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.

_**Targeting Cookies**_

These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal data, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

**How to reject cookies**
