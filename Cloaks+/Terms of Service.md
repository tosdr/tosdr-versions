Legal Stuff
===========

Cloak Rules
===========

Here at Cloaks+, you can upload your own cloaks, and in order to keep it clean, every design must be approved by one of our cape verifiers. Our verifiers will reject any capes that violate the following rules:

* **No NSFW content**, period. Cloaks+ aims to be a family friendly community. Cloaks+ reserves to right to determine what content we deem as NSFW, and will not allow any content that includes but is not limited to: illegal activity, nudity, sexually suggestive or pornographic material, etc. Attempting to upload NSFW content will result in an account warning, and if excessive, a permanent non-appealable ban from all Cloaks+ services.
* **No capes from Minecon or official Mojang capes.** If it is indistinguishable from one of these capes, it's not allowed. Minecon capes are exclusive to those who actually have gone to the event and it would be unfair to allow them. However, recolored or modified Minecon capes are allowed if one can easily distinguish that it is not an official cape.
* **No cloaks made by other mods such as Optifine, Lunar, Badlion, or Mantle** that contain unique and distinguishable content. For example, one may use Mantle's Shield Cape because it doesn't contain unique content. In layman's terms: it's just a minecraft shield and that cannot be claimed. This also means Optifine banner capes are allowed, but nothing portraying as a genuine OF cape.
* **No human faces**, except for celebrities or memes. We do not want people using someone's face without their permission, and we cannot practically verify that the person in the photo is you.
* **No cloaks that contain impersonating information**, which we define as anything that portrays you as someone that you are not. For example, you cannot have a cape that says, “Cloaks+ Staff”, unless you are actually staff at Cloaks+.
* **No cloaks that contain hateful content.** This includes slurs used hatefully, swastikas, gore, dogwhistles, etc.
* **All cloaks must follow the Cloak Template provided by us**, or they simply will not work. Just like minecraft skins, they are rendered as a texture in game and if it doesn't follow the format, it will not render properly.
