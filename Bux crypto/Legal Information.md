Do we disclose your personal data to others and where is data being stored?



BUX stores your personal data on our IT systems located in the European Economic Area (EEA).

BUX engages various data processors for the processing of your personal data on our behalf,

including IT service providers and other business service providers.



We have contracts in place with our data processors, which means that they cannot do anything

with your personal data unless we have instructed them to do so. They will not share your personal

data with any organisation (unless legally required to do so) apart from us. They will hold it

securely and retain it for the period that we instruct.



BUX may be legally required to disclose your personal data in response to requests from

regulators and law enforcement or security agencies, in which case these regulators and law

enforcement or security agencies will be acting as a data controller as well. BUX will always

assess the legitimacy of such requests before disclosing any personal data and will only disclose

the personal data required to comply with such a request.

7

We also disclose your email address or device ID to the social media platforms as mentioned on:

www.getbux.com/gdprlist to allow them to market our mobile apps to potentially interested social

media users, as described under (e) above.



From what sources do we collect your personal data?



We may obtain personal data from various sources, including:



● You directly through our BUX and Stryk mobile applications and web platforms; and

● Third party companies like IVXS UK Limited, trading as Comply Advantage, who we

engage for performing background checks that form part of our acceptance process.



● Chainalysis as our Cryptocurrency Transaction Monitoring provider for BUX Crypto, who we

engage with for performing monitoring on all incoming and outgoing cryptocurrency

transactions.



5\. Protection of your personal data



BUX has implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure the processing

of personal data. These safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity, format, location, amount,

distribution, and storage of the personal data, and include measures designed to keep personal

data protected from unauthorised access. If appropriate, these safeguards include the encryption

of communications via SSL, encryption of information during storage, firewalls, access controls,

separation of duties, and similar security protocols.



We grant access only to the members of our personnel and third parties that have legitimate,

relevant business purposes to process your personal data.



All our staff members, contractors and third parties are bound to confidentiality and have limited

access only to the personal information that is necessary for the performance of their

responsibilities and tasks.



We have information security policies and systems in place which are frequently audited. We take

the security of our IT infrastructure very seriously.



6\. Limiting Collection and Retention



We collect, use, disclose and otherwise process the personal data that is only necessary for the

purposes identified in this Privacy Notice or as permitted by the Data Protection Rules. If we plan

to process your personal data for a purpose different than those mentioned above, we will notify

you and, if required, ask for your prior consent.



8

We retain your personal data for as long as you access and make use of our apps and platforms.

In any case we will retain your personal data and keep your profile active until you, or under

exceptional circumstances, we, end our customer relationship with you. After our customer

relationship with you has ended, we will retain your personal data for a limited period of time.



Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We

retain personal data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the

personal data was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we retain

your personal data after you have closed your account where necessary to comply with our legal

obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes,

maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or fulfil your request to “unsubscribe” from further

messages from us.



We will retain de-personalized (aggregated) information after your account has been closed, but

such information will no longer allow us to identify you. Information that you have shared with other

users of our apps (e.g., updates or group posts) will remain visible for others after you have ceased

using our apps. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show the user at the source.

Your profile may continue to be displayed in other companies’ services (e.g., search engine

results).



7\. Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Data



BUX may transfer personal data to, or permit access to personal data from, countries outside the

European Economic Area (EEA). These countries’ data protection laws do not always offer the

same level of protection for personal data as offered in the EEA. We will, in all circumstances,

safeguard personal data as set out in this Privacy Notice.



Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing

essentially equivalent protections as EEA data protection laws. The Data Protection Rules allow

BUX to freely transfer personal data to such countries. If we transfer personal data to other

countries outside the EEA, we will establish legal grounds justifying such transfer, such as model

contractual clauses, individuals’ consent, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal

requirements.



You can request additional information about the specific safeguards applied to the export of

personal data from our data protection officer.
