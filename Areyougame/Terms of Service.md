Sweepstakes Official Rules
--------------------------

**Open only to residents of the fifty United States, District of Columbia, and United States Territories who are 18 years of age or older. NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. A PURCHASE WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING.**

**ELIGIBILITY:** The AreYouGame.com Ratings and Reviews Sweepstakes (the “Sweepstakes”) is open to legal residents of the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, and United State Territories who are 18 years of age or older at the time of entry. Employees, officers, and directors of Sponsor, and each of their affiliated companies, parents, subsidiaries and licensees (collectively, the “Sweepstakes Entities”), and each of their immediate family members and/or people living in the same household, are not eligible to participate or to win. Eligibility is subject to all federal, state and local laws and regulations. All entries submitted are the property of the Sponsor. The Administrator’s computer server will be the official timekeeper for all matters related to this Sweepstakes.

**HOW TO ENTER:** There shall be separate Sweepstakes (each a “Sweepstakes”) conducted four (4) times a year: January 1st - March 31st, April 1st - June 30th, July 1st - September 30th, and October 1st - December 31st. Each Sweepstakes Period begins at 12:00:01 a.m. Central Standard Time (“CST”) on the first day of each Sweepstakes Period and ends at 11:59 p.m. EDT on the last day of each Sweepstakes Period. You will be automatically entered into the Sweepstakes by completing a rating or review on AreYouGame.com during a Sweepstakes Period. Entry registration may require registration on AreYouGame.com and include your email address. Entry in this Sweepstakes does not constitute entry into any other sweepstakes, contest or promotion. By participating in the Sweepstakes, each entrant unconditionally accepts and agrees to comply with and abide by these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor and Administrator, whose decisions shall be final and legally binding in all respects. Limit one (1) entry per person and/or email address for each rating or review entered on AreYouGame.com.

The Sponsor is not responsible for misdirected, late, incomplete, illegible, or lost entries, or any unforeseen circumstances, including but not limited to issues involving the internet or accessing the AreYouGame.com ratings and review pages, that may limit an individual’s ability to participate in the Sweepstakes. All entries become the property of the Sponsor and will not be returned. Entries made by any other individual or any entity, including but not limited to commercial sweepstakes subscription notification and/or entering services, will be declared invalid and disqualified for this Sweepstakes. Ratings or reviews created in violation of the AreYouGame.com Customer Ratings and Reviews terms and conditions or Ratings and Reviews Guidelines will be declared invalid and disqualified for this Sweepstakes. Tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes is prohibited and any entries deemed by Sponsor, in its sole discretion, to have been submitted in this manner would be void. Entries generated by a script, macro or other automated means will be disqualified. Entries that are incomplete, garbled, corrupted or unintelligible for any reason, including, but not limited to, computer, network or telephone connection malfunction or congestion, are void and will not be accepted. In case of a dispute over the identity of an entrant the authorized account holder of the email address used to enter will be deemed to be the entrant. “Authorized account holder” is defined as the person who is assigned to an email address by an Internet Access Provider, online service provider or other organization that is responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address.

Alternate form of entry: Email orders@areyougame.com and provide your first name, last name, mailing address, city, state, zip code, telephone number (including area code), and year of birth to receive one (1) Entry into that Sweepstakes period.

**PRIZE/ODDS:** The grand prize for each Sweepstakes will be an AreYouGame.com e-Gift Card in the amount of $50. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries received for each Sweepstakes in each Sweepstakes Period. Total maximum approximate retail value of all prizes for each Sweepstakes is $50.

Prizes are provided on an “as is” basis, without any warranty of any kind and are non-transferable. Any portion of the Prize not accepted by the Winner will be forfeited. Prizes may not be redeemed for cash or substituted in any manner.

**DRAWING/NOTIFICATION:** A random drawing will be conducted on or about three business days after the end of each Sweepstakes Period from all eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Period. Conduct of the Sweepstakes and the drawing are under the supervision of the Administrator. Prize winner(s) will be notified by email. Sponsor shall have no liability for any potential prize winning notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by any potential winner for any reason. If, despite reasonable efforts, any potential prize winner does not respond within three (3) days of the first notification attempt such potential prize winner will forfeit his or her prize and an alternate winner may be selected. Return of any prize notification as undeliverable may result in disqualification and selection of an alternate winner solely at the Sponsor’s discretion. If any potential prize winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Rules or declines a prize for any reason prior to award, such potential prize winner will be disqualified and an alternate prize winner may be selected. Sponsor will use reasonable efforts to select an alternate winner but in the event one cannot be reasonably determined, such prize will not be awarded.

**GENERAL PRIZE RESTRICTIONS/CONDITIONS:** The Sweepstakes is offered to eligible participants as specified in these official rules, but void where prohibited or restricted by law. By entering, each entrant agrees for entrant and for entrant’s heirs, executors, and administrators (A) to release and hold harmless the Sweepstakes Entities, from any liability, illness, injury, death, loss, litigation or damage that may occur, directly or indirectly, whether caused by negligence or not, from such entrant’s participation in the Sweepstakes and/or their acceptance, possession, use, or misuse of prize or any portion thereof (including any travel related thereto); (B) the Sweepstakes Entities have neither made nor are in any manner responsible or liable for any warranty, representation or guarantee express or implied, in fact or in law, with respect to any prize, including, without limitation, to such prize’s quality or fitness for a particular purpose; and (C) to be bound by these Official Rules and to waive any right to claim any ambiguity or error therein or in the Sweepstakes itself, and to be bound by all decisions of the Sponsor and Administrator, which are legally binding and final in all respects. Failure to comply with these conditions may result in disqualification from the Sweepstakes at Sponsor’s sole discretion. Winner accepts and agrees to be bound by these rules and the decisions of the Sponsor relating to winner’s participation in the Sweepstakes, selection of the winners and awarding of the prizes, whose decisions are final. Sponsor expressly disclaims any responsibility, and entrants agree to hold the Sweepstakes Entities harmless from any liability or injury or loss to any person or property relating to participation in this Sweepstakes or the delivery and/or subsequent use or misuse of any of the prizes awarded.

**DISQUALIFICATION/FORCE MAJEURE:** Sponsor is not responsible for lost, late, mutilated, misdirected, illegible, incomplete, inaccurate, or stolen, submissions or prize notifications. Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual who is found to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes, to be acting in violation of these Official Rules, or to be acting in an unsportsman-like or disruptive manner, or with the intent to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes, or to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, and Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. No mechanically reproduced, illegible, incomplete, forged, software-generated or other automated multiple entries will be accepted.

Sponsor reserves the right to modify, extend, suspend, or terminate the Sweepstakes if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Sweepstakes is technically impaired or corrupted or that fraud or technical problems, failures or malfunctions or other causes beyond Sponsor’s control have destroyed or severely undermined or to any degree impaired the integrity, administration, security, proper play and/or feasibility of the Sweepstakes as contemplated herein. In the event an insufficient number of eligible entries are received and/or Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or continuing with the Sweepstakes as contemplated herein by any event beyond its control, including but not limited to fire, flood, natural or man-made epidemic of health or other means, earthquake, explosion, labor dispute or strike, act of God or public enemy, satellite or equipment failure, riot or civil disturbance, terrorist threat or activity, war (declared or undeclared) or any federal state or local government law, order, or regulation, public health crisis, order of any court or jurisdiction, or other cause not reasonably within Sponsor’s control, then Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Sweepstakes. If the Sweepstakes is terminated before the designated end date, Sponsor will (if possible) select the winners in a random drawing from all eligible, non-suspect entries received as of the date of the event giving rise to the termination. Inclusion in such drawing shall be each entrant’s sole and exclusive remedy under such circumstances. Only the type and quantity of prizes described in these Official Rules will be awarded. If, for any reason, more bona fide winners come forward seeking to claim prizes in excess of the number of each type of prize set forth in these Official Rules, the winners, or remaining winners, as the case may be, of the advertised number of prizes available in the prize category in question may be selected in a random drawing from among all persons making purportedly valid claims for such prize(s). These Official Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way except in a written document issued in accordance with law by a duly authorized representative of Sponsor.
