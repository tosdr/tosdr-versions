For purposes of these Terms, any use of this Content on any other Web site or networked computer environment for any purpose is prohibited.

**Use of Software.** If you download any software from this Site (“Software”), the Software, including all code, files, images, contained in or generated by the Software, and accompanying data, are deemed to be licensed to you by Kramer. Neither title nor intellectual property rights are transferred to you, but remain with Kramer, who owns full and complete title. You may not resell, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise convert the Software to a perceivable form. You may not download or install the Software until you have read and accepted these Terms.

**Copyrights, Trademarks And Service Marks.** Unless otherwise noted, all Content and other materials on this Site are protected as the copyrights, trade dress, trademarks and/or other intellectual properties owned by Kramer or by other parties that have licensed their material to Kramer.  The Content of this Site is copyrighted and any unauthorized use of the Content of this Site may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws, in addition to being a material breach of the Terms of Use.

There are a number of proprietary logos, service marks, trademarks, slogans and product designations (“Marks”) found on this Site. By making them available on this Site, Kramer is not granting you a license to use them in any fashion. Access to this Site does not confer upon you any license under any of Kramer or any third party’s intellectual property rights. Use of Kramer proprietary logos, service marks, trademarks, slogans and product designations found on this Site by users is restricted as set forth in these Terms of Use.

**User Submissions.** The Site may allow you to submit content to Kramer, including text, images, graphics, information, data, or other material in any other form (together, the “Communications”). Kramer does not solicit, but may accept, Communications containing product or process ideas, innovations, suggestions, or improvements on the Site. If you provide Kramer with Communications, you hereby grant Kramer and its designees an unrestricted, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, transmit and distribute all Communications for any and all commercial or non-commercial purposes, and agree that Kramer is free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques that you send Kramer for any purpose whatsoever without compensation to you or any other person sending the Communication. Kramer will not be liable for the content of any Communications or for any ideas for its business (including without limitation, product, or advertising ideas) and will not incur any liability as a result of any similarities that may appear in future Kramer operations. In addition, you warrant that all so-called “moral rights” with respect to any Communications have been waived.

You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from this Site any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or any other material that would violate any law, or that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under the law. You acknowledge that the Site may be subject to breaches of security and that you are aware that Communications may not be secure, and you will consider this before submitting any Communications.

**User Forums or other Communication Networks.** To the extent the Site may host user forums or similar methods for user communications, Kramer may, but is not obligated to, monitor or review any areas on the Site where users transmit or post Communications or communicate solely with each other, including but not limited to chat rooms, bulletin boards, communication networks or other user forums, and the content of any such Communications. Kramer is free in its sole discretion to remove, edit, delete or modify any Communications deemed undesirable without prior notice to the user submitting such Communications; however, Kramer will have no liability related to the content of any such Communications, whether or not arising under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy, obscenity, or otherwise, and retains the right to remove messages that include any material deemed abusive, defamatory, obscene or otherwise unacceptable.

Such links to third party Web sites on this Site are provided solely as a convenience to you, and do not constitute or imply an endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation of, or affiliation with the third party or its products and services. Kramer has not reviewed all of these third party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites or their content. Thus, Kramer makes no representations whatsoever about any other web site, which you may access through this Site, or any information, software or other products or materials, found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that Kramer is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, services or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select for your use is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature, and you do so entirely at your own risk. Accordingly, you agree that Kramer shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such third-party materials, content, products or services available on or through any such site or resource.

**Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.** Kramer respects the intellectual property rights of others, and expects its users to do the same.

Any notifications of claimed copyright infringement must be sent to Kramer at the following address [\[email protected\]](https://funginail.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) When notifying Kramer of the alleged copyright infringement, please provide complete and sufficient information, including:

* a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
* identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that Site;
* identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit Kramer to locate the material;
* information reasonably sufficient to permit Kramer to contact the complaining party;
* a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Kramer will terminate the service privileges of users who repeatedly infringe the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others. United States law provides significant penalties for falsely submitting a notice of copyright infringement.
