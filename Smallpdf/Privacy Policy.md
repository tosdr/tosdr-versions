For our desktop app, we process information related to your device, your IP address, and information on the browser you use for the download (browser type, version, and operating system).

##### 1.3 Use of our services via third-party services

You may be able to access our services and upload User Files via third-party services, such as Dropbox and Google Drive. For this purpose, you do not have to create a User Account with us or provide your login credentials for the third-party service or application. Rather, we will let you access our services with an authorization token (aka “OAuth token”) from the third-party service provider confirming that you are a valid user of their service. We process this information to enable your use of our services (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR).

##### 1.4 User Account

If you create a Smallpdf account (including for a free trial of our services) via our website, mobile apps, or desktop app, we process your email address and the password you choose at registration.

You can also create a user account for our services using your pre-existing Google, Apple, or Facebook accounts and use that third-party platform’s credentials to log in to your user account with us. If you choose this option, you allow us to request and use some of Your Personal Data from the third-party account.

For Google, this involves us processing your name, surname, email address, and public profile information (e.g. profile picture). For Facebook, we will process your email address and public profile information (username and profile picture). For Apple, this involves us processing your username and email address. The third-party platform may ask for your consent to share this data with us. As the personal data we may process under this option was originally collected by the third-party platform, the initial data processing and sharing of the data with us is governed by the privacy policy of such third-party platforms (thus, either Google, Apple, or Facebook). Please refer to the relevant third-party platform and/or its settings, if you want to deactivate the connection between the third-party platform and us.

We process Your Personal Data to set up your user account and, thus, form a contractual relationship (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR).

For security reasons, we also process the time, browser, IP address of your last login, and the time of your last password reset. We have a legitimate interest to process this information to filter out suspicious login requests and to detect and prevent abuse of your user credentials (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR).

We process Your Personal Data to suggest the right type of subscription for your needs to you and to complete your purchase. The data processing serves to conclude and fulfill the subscription contract between you and us (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR).

###### a) Payment

We use payment data and information on your subscription and payment history (subscription plan, billing period, etc.) to process the regular payments for your Smallpdf Pro subscription and, thus, fulfill our contract (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR).

###### b) Invoices

We process your account, subscription, and payment information to fulfill our legal obligations (legal data storage obligations, e.g. under tax law) (Art. 6 (1) c GDPR) and provide you with invoices under our contract (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR).

When you communicate with us via email, including for customer support, you provide us with your email address and may provide us with your name, contact details, and other personal data, including the content of your email. We process this information to answer your request (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR).

We may send you our newsletter or other marketing emails, generally only with your consent (Art. 6 (1) a GDPR). However, where you have already purchased products and/or services from us, we may inform you about our similar products or services via email where we have informed you of such a possibility in advance and allowed you to refuse it.

#### 6\. How and for how long do we store Your Personal Data?

In brief: We keep Your Personal Data and the User Files you upload only as long as they are needed for the provision of our services or as required by law.

We will only retain Your Personal Data and User Files you upload for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal requirements. To help us, we apply criteria to determine the appropriate periods for retaining Your Personal Data depending on its purpose, such as account maintenance, facilitating client relationship management, and responding to legal claims or requests from authorities.

If you do not have a User Account (see Section 1.4 above) or are not logged in when using our services (e.g. when being asked for a signature via our eSign tool, see Section 1.9 above), we will generally aim to delete User Files within a reasonable period of time after the last time they were opened. Please note that this retention period is extended every time you reopen the respective User File. Please note that if you use third-party services to access our services, data retention of User Files by the respective provider may differ.

If you access our services via a User Account, we delete User Files within one hour unless you save them to your file storage. When you choose to delete saved User Files, we generally delete them within 14 days.

#### 7\. Which data transfers outside the EU/EEA take place?

In brief: In some cases, we may transfer Your Personal Data outside of Switzerland and will ensure that Your Personal Data is well protected irrespective of its location.

We are located in Switzerland, which has been recognized as a safe third country in an adequacy decision of the European Commission. When you use our services, Your Personal Data may be transferred to recipients located in other countries, including outside the EU/EEA such as Serbia or in case of some customer support cases - the Philippines.

Where such a recipient country does not provide for an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission, we will only transfer Your Personal Data to the recipient country on the basis of appropriate safeguards, such as binding corporate rules, revised standard contractual clauses (European Commission decision 2021/914 of 4 June 2021), or when another exception under Art. 49 GDPR applies. Please contact us (see “Contact Us” section) to request information on the specific safeguards that are in use for the recipients of Your Personal Data.

When making such transfers, we will ensure compliance with the applicable legal requirements for disclosing personal data to third parties. The legal provisions governing the disclosure of personal data to third parties are duly observed. The countries to which data is transmitted include those that, according to the decision of the Federal Council and the European Commission, have an adequate level of data protection (such as the member states of the EEA or, from the EU's perspective, Switzerland), as well as those countries (such as the the United States of America) whose level of data protection is generally speaking not considered adequate (see Annex 1 of the Data Protection Ordinance (DPO) and [the website of the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en)). 

If the country in question does not provide an adequate level of data protection, we ensure that your data is adequately protected by these companies by means of appropriate safeguards, unless an exception is specified on a case-by-case basis for the individual data processing (see Article 49 of the GDPR). Unless otherwise specified, these safeguards may be provided for by standard contractual clauses as referred to in Article 46(2)(c) of the GDPR, which can be found on the websites of [the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC)](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/de/home/datenschutz/arbeit_wirtschaft/datenuebermittlung_ausland.html)  and [the EU Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_de).
