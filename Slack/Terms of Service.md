**Last updated: 25th April 2023**

The Main Services Agreement and the Slack Supplemental Terms (together, the ‘**Slack Terms**’) describe your rights and responsibilities when using our online workplace productivity tools and platform (the ‘**Services**’).

If you are ‘Customer’, the Slack Terms govern your access to and use of our Services. If you are being invited to a workspace set up by Customer, the User Terms of Service (the ‘**User Terms**’) govern your access to and use of the Services.

Please read the Slack Terms carefully because they are a binding agreement between you and us. The Main Services Agreement is available at the following Salesforce link, as Slack is a Salesforce company:
