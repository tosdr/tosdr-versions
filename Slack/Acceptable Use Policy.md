This acceptable use policy sets out a list of acceptable and unacceptable conduct for our Services. If we believe that a violation of the policy is deliberate, repeated or presents a credible risk of harm to other users, our customers, the Services or any third parties, we may suspend or terminate your access. This policy may change as Slack grows and evolves, so please check back regularly for updates and changes. Capitalised terms used below but not defined in this policy have the meaning set forth in the [User Terms of Service](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/terms-of-service/user).

Slack may exercise its right to analyse information to protect the safety of users and prevent illegal activity. We use privacy-protective hash-based detection software to proactively remove child sexual abuse material. Slack also accepts and investigates reports of violations of both the User Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy from Customers and Users. Reports are reviewed by trained individuals and prohibited content may be deleted from the Services. We place strict controls over employee access to Customer Data. There are technical controls and audit policies in place to ensure that access to Customer Data is logged. For more information see our [Security practices](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/security-practices) page.

Do:
---

* comply with all User Terms of Service, including the terms of this Acceptable Use Policy;
* comply with all applicable laws and governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, all intellectual property, data, privacy and export control laws, and regulations promulgated by any government agencies, including, but not limited to, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and any rules of any national and other securities exchanges;
* upload and disseminate only Customer Data to which the Customer owns all required rights under law and under contractual and fiduciary relationships (such as proprietary and confidential information learnt or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under non-disclosure agreements) and do so only in a manner consistent with applicable law;
* use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorised access to or use of the Services;
* keep passwords and all other login information confidential;
* monitor and control all activity conducted through your account in connection with the Services;
