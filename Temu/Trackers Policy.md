Certain of these disclosures to third parties are known as “sharing” or processing your personal information for targeted ads and but “sharing” may be considered “selling” your personal information under applicable law.

In addition, our content may be integrated into web pages or other online services that are not associated with us. If you choose to connect to the Service through your social media account or another third-party platform, you may be able to use your settings in your account with that platform to limit the information we receive from it.

Children
--------

Temu does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use our Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are under the age of 13 through the Service. If we become aware that we have unintentionally collected personal data from a child under the age of 13 through the Service, we will delete the information from our records. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 may have provided us with personal data, contact us as specified in the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy or through our [online reporting form](https://www.temu.com/bgp_delete_request.html).

Data Security and Retention
---------------------------

The security of your personal information is important to us. We use technical and administrative measures to help protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. We also follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) in handling your credit card information. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies.

We generally retain personal information to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, as well as for the purposes of satisfying any U.S. legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we may either delete it, anonymize it, or isolate it from further processing.

Data of Temu U.S. users will be stored by default in the infrastructure of Microsoft Azure or a similar cloud service provider in the U.S. Temu is a global one-stop shopping destination, therefore where necessary, Temu may transfer data related to order fulfillment to service providers in other countries to provide order fulfillment and logistics services. Sensitive personal information (such as account and profile information) unrelated to fulfillment services will not be transferred. At the same time, in all cases, we will ensure that all transfers of personal data comply with applicable U.S. legal requirements.

Privacy Notice Addendum for US Residents

US users can learn more about which rights may be available to them and how to exercise those rights by reviewing [US Privacy Notice Addendum for US Residents](https://www.temu.com/privacy-policy-addendum-for-us-residents.html).
