Cookie notice
=============

* These scripts may gather data for web statistics, which then may be used for interest-based advertising on other services (such as Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn), and they may offer additional functionality to the websites (such as chat).
* The websites and third-party scripts may use cookies or local storage. Cookies and local storage can be used to identify a returning visitor. Cookies and local storage in themselves do not identify you as an individual – but if you for instance are using Facebook, and subsequently visit our websites, Facebook may learn about your visit.
* On our websites, we are tracking data for analytical purposes into our data stores and prediction models powered by Optimizely Content Recommendations and Optimizely Analytics. 
* For certain parts of our websites, for instance pages that require a login, cookies are required for the website to work properly. Otherwise, cookies are generally not required for the operation of the website.
* We set a cookie and use local storage in your browser that contains information that we use to identify you between visits. In particular, we set an identifier that identifies you for the functional site features described in the tables below.
* **How you can opt out of web tracking -** Because we respect your right to privacy, you can choose not to allow some types of cookies. Click on the different category headings under [Cookie Settings](https://www.optimizely.com/#cookie-settings) to find out more and change our default settings. However, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the services we are able to offer.

Strictly necessary

These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.  
  
You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
