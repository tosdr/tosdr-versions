Persons, who already have their own account with Services may be connected as team members to existing owner account, and may use all the benefits of owner account Subscription. Such connection will only be limited to purchases within the owner account (Subscription and domain names), and will not apply to domain names and Subscription available within a third party account, who is connected as a team member.

You may utilize the Services by interconnecting your and your personnel accounts, and granting them access to your Subscription benefits. You may also connect your personnel who do not have an account with Services with SSO login technology, where a SAML based account will be created.

You may delete your account in the Services settings dashboard. Should you disconnect a third party account in your account dashboard or completely remove your own account, all access granted to third parties will be closed.  Due to specifics of technology, disconnected SAML based accounts will be temporarily suspended. If you have a SAML based account it may be restored or completely removed by contacting our support.
