#### A. GENERAL

This section to inform you about tracking technologies that we use on Site. For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate. While cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term “Cookies” is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.

Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require your consent, depending on the applicable law. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided herein.

Short.io uses Trackers managed directly by us (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified herein, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them. The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by us or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of your browsing session.

#### COOKIES CONSENT MANAGEMENT

There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:

Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.

Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, you can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences widget, if available.

It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the user’s initial consent.

Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.

With regard to any third-party Trackers, users can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.

#### Locating Tracker Settings

* [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)
