_Effective: March 1, 2024._

Coursera ("us", "we", or "our") uses cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies (“cookies and related technologies”) on coursera.org and affiliated websites (collectively the "Site").

Our Cookies Policy explains what cookies and related technologies are, how we use cookies and related technologies, how third-parties we partner with may use cookies and related technologies on the Site, and your choices regarding cookies and related technologies. Please read this Cookies Policy in conjunction with our [Privacy Notice](https://www.coursera.org/about/privacy), which sets out additional details on how we use personal data (including personally identifiable information) and your various rights.

What are cookies and related technologies

Cookies are small pieces of text sent by your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Site or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Site more useful to you. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the Coursera servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Site and related functionalities. Cookies and web beacons allow Coursera to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience on our Site. Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies.

When you use and access the Site, we may place a number of cookies and/or web beacon files in your web browser. Coursera uses or may use cookies and/or web beacons to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Site links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Site, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. To the extent that such collected data constitutes personally identifiable information, we process such data as set out in our Privacy Notice. We use both session and persistent cookies and related technologies, of different types, on the Site:

* _Essential cookies and related technologies._ Necessary for the operation of the Site. We may use essential cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of user accounts, or offer Site features.

* _Functionality cookies and related technologies._ Used to recognize you when you return to the Site. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* _Targeting cookies and related technologies._ Record your visit to the Site, the pages you have visited, and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make the Site and the content more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.

If you'd like to delete cookies or instruct your web browser to delete or refuse cookies, please visit the help pages of your web browser. You can also use the “Manage Preferences” link in the “How Coursera uses cookies” section above to change your settings in respect of cookies and related technologies, depending on your location. Coursera does not currently recognize do-not-track signals from your web browser.

Please note, however, that if you delete, reject, or refuse to accept cookies and related technologies, you might not be able to use some or all of the features we offer. You may not be able to log in, store your preferences, and some of our pages might not display properly.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there is currently no industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
