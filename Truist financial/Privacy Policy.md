    This technology may be placed on certain pages of our website, applications, emails, and other marketing initiatives. These tags usually work in conjunction with cookies and allow us to measure the effectiveness of our site and compile statistics about usage and response rates.
* #### Software Development Kits (SDKs) –
    
    Our mobile applications may include third-party SDKs that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your mobile app activity. In addition, some mobile devices come with a resettable advertising ID (such as Apple’s IDFA and Google’s Advertising ID) that, like cookies and pixel tags, may allow us and our service providers to identify your mobile device over time for advertising purposes in compliance with applicable app store consent rules.
* #### Advertising and Cross-Device Tracking –
    
    Truist uses certain Adobe Analytics services and products, which help companies build websites, applications, and advertisements that seamlessly flow between all your devices (such as a desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, or smart watch). The Adobe services recognize which of your devices are linked through use of technology that includes cookies and your IP address (without collecting your sensitive personal information). Visit the [Adobe website](https://www.truist.com/speedbump/truist-speedbump?url=https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html) for more information on opting out of certain services, cross-device tracking, and/or to unlink your devices. NOTE: Adobe needs to install a cookie on your browser to identify that you have opted out. If you delete the opt-out cookie, or change devices or web browsers, you will need to opt out again.
* #### Firewalls, passcodes, data encryption, and other safety features –
    
    Truist uses these technologies to help secure the information you provide to us. To learn more about how we safeguard your information online, please visit our  [Truist fraud and security](https://www.truist.com/fraud-and-security) center for measures you can take to protect yourself.
* #### Third-party plugins –
    
    Other companies may have plugins that appear on certain pages of our website or applications. Some of these, for example, may be from social media companies (for example, the Facebook “Like” button). These plugins may collect information, such as information about the pages you visit, and share it with the company that created the plugin even if you do not click on the plugin. These third-party plugins and the way they operate are governed by the privacy policies and terms of the companies that created them.

### How does Truist interact with me online?

#### Online advertising on Truist websites and applications

Truist advertises its products and services on pages within our sites and on mobile applications. To make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, Truist may target and personalize content and advertisements for products and services on our site and within Online Banking (when clients sign on or off to online accounts with their user ID/password).

If you would prefer to not receive a _specific_ advertisement, content or offers on Truist authenticated (after signing in) pages, you can click “No Thanks” to the specific pop-up ad you’re being presented. Note that this will not prevent you from potentially receiving other ads, content, or offers for a different product or service. Also note that simply closing the pop-up message by clicking on the “X” will not register that you do not wish to receive this specific message again.

#### Online advertising on third-party websites and applications

Truist advertises its products and services on websites and applications not affiliated with Truist. The third-party companies we hire to display these ads use their own tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your interests. Many of our third-party partners have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review these policies carefully.

Some of our third-party advertising is interest-based and may use information about your online interests to customize the online ads you see. Truist has adopted the use of AdChoices offered by the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.truist.com/speedbump/truist-speedbump?url=http://youradchoices.com/) for our interest-based advertising (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). To opt out of interest-based advertising and conduct a DAA Webchoices Browser Check, visit [YourAdChoices](https://www.truist.com/speedbump/truist-speedbump?url=https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN). Anyone receiving an interest-based ad can click on the displayed icon to receive more information. [YourAdChoices](https://www.truist.com/speedbump/truist-speedbump?url=https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) does not prevent you from receiving advertisements; instead, it allows you to control whether you receive interest-based advertisements and from which companies. For additional options, you may also visit [NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising](https://www.truist.com/speedbump/truist-speedbump?url=http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1).

#### Third-party aggregation services and tools

Aggregation allows you to gather information from many websites and view that information in a consolidated format. An example of why you might use a third-party aggregation tool is if you wanted a comprehensive view of assets and liabilities held within your financial accounts. If you provide information about your Truist accounts (including your access information) to an aggregation service provider, we will consider that as your having authorized all transactions initiated by that aggregation site. Truist reserves the right to disable aggregation for any account without notice. If you wish to cancel your third-party aggregation services, you should also change your password at Truist.com.

#### Social media

Truist provides experiences on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, or Twitter that enable online sharing and collaboration. We use social media to facilitate social engagement and sharing, when such sharing is appropriate and safe. Read more about Truist and social media [terms and conditions here](https://www.truist.com/social-media-terms-and-conditions). Please note, any content you post, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those platforms. Please refer to them to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.

Given the very public nature of social media, it is critical that we all safeguard confidential financial information. If you post information on a Truist site that we feel should be shielded from public view, we will remove it. This includes not only specific details about your Truist accounts and other private, confidential information (such as your Social Security number), but details of information relayed in private conversations between you and Truist representatives. Please know that in taking down or editing your posts, we are focusing our experience and best judgment to keep your personal information safe.

#### Email

Email transmitted across the internet is normally not protected and may be intercepted and viewed by others. Therefore, you should refrain from sending any confidential or private information via unsecured email to Truist. We'll never ask you to send confidential information to us via email, such as your logon ID, password, full account numbers, or Social Security number. To secure your communications with us, use Secure Messaging in online banking.

Occasionally, we will retain the content of your email—and our replies—to confirm proper responses to your questions and requests, to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and to ensure that we consistently deliver an enjoyable client experience to you.  

#### Linking to other sites

Truist may provide links to non-Truist companies, such as credit bureaus or merchants, and will notify you when leaving the Truist site. If you choose to link to websites not controlled by Truist, we are not responsible for the privacy or security of these sites, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability or suitability of their information. If you are asked to provide information on one of these sites, we urge you to carefully study their privacy policies before sharing.

#### Control your online and other privacy preferences

In summary, the following links can help you to customize and control your privacy preferences when interacting with Truist online:

* You can also control your marketing preferences for direct mail, email, and telemarketing preferences, along with the sharing of your personal information via our automated voice response line at **[888-800-3420](tel:888-800-3420),** or our Client Contact Center. 
* Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control
    * We will respond to the [Global Privacy Control](https://www.truist.com/speedbump/truist-speedbump?url=https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) signal as explained further in our CCPA Notice at Collection. At this time, we do not currently respond to other browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that allow you to tell websites you do not want to have online activities tracked.
* You can also update your email preferences [here](https://www.truist.com/speedbump/truist-speedbump?url=https://preferences.truist.com/OptOut/Index?email=&campaign=&vendor=TP&lob=global&category=global&subcategory=&cin=&deploymentId=&language=EN_US).

### How does Truist protect my children?

Truist strictly follows the federal guidelines of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which gives parents control over what type of information is collected online about their children. We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personally identifiable information from children under age 13 on our websites. We are not responsible for the data collection and use practices of nonaffiliated third parties that are linked from our websites.

### How does Truist protect me from fraud and secure information?

To protect personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with applicable federal and state laws. These measures may include device safeguards and secured files and buildings as well as oversight of our third-party service providers to help protect the confidentiality and security of information. Please visit the [Truist Fraud and Security Center](https://www.truist.com/fraud-and-security) for additional information.

### How can I make sure my information is accurate and use my individual rights?

You can also contact us or call or write to us at the telephone numbers or appropriate address for changes listed on your account statements, records, online or other account materials. You can also speak to a client representative at a branch location, your financial advisor, or an account representative.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We will ask you to verify your identity to help us respond efficiently to your request.

Under non-U.S. data protection laws, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.

### What is Truist's cellular phone identity verification statement?

You authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to us or our service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help them identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. This Statement of Online Privacy Practices and [Consumer Privacy Notice](https://www.truist.com/content/dam/truist-bank/us/en/documents/footer/privacy-policy-truist-english.pdf) detail how we treat your data.

### How will Truist notify me about online privacy practices updates?

### Sources of Personal Information

Truist collects information from various sources, including:

* Directly from you or your guardians/representatives
* Service providers that support our business operations (e.g., data analytics providers)
* Websites, mobile applications, and social media
* Our affiliates or subsidiaries
* Outside merchants or business partners such as credit card or lending partnerships, or corporate clients
* Public records or publicly available data
* Data brokers

* Government entities

### Consumer Rights Under the CCPA

Right to Know / See Data Request

You have the right to request that Truist disclose categories or specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you over the last 12 months, the categories of sources from which that information was collected, the business or commercial purpose(s) for which the information was collected, sold, or shared with third parties for cross context behavioral advertising, and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.

Right to Correct

You have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information maintained by Truist.  In many instances, such updates are best made by logging into your online account or employee portals, calling 1-844-4TRUIST, or visiting a branch, and some corrections may require specific documentation to be provided as required by law. If you provide us documentation, it will only be used or maintained for the purpose of correcting the information and complying with our recordkeeping requirements under the CCPA. Truist also provides the [**Privacy Center**](https://privacycenter.truist.com/) and privacy request line as described below.

Right to Delete

You have the right to request deletion of personal information that Truist has collected, subject to certain exceptions. For example, we may deny your request if retaining the information is necessary for us to complete a transaction you requested or comply with our legal obligations.  

### Submitting a Verified Consumer Request

Consumers are welcome to submit right to know, correction, or deletion requests by visiting our [**Privacy Center**](https://privacycenter.truist.com/) or by calling [888-294-2265](tel:888-294-2265).

All requests must be verified prior to receiving a response, using Truist authentication protocols. Requesters will be asked to supply certain basic personal information to enable us to verify the request against our records, such as name, Social Security number, and address. Information submitted for verification purposes will only be used to verify the requestor’s identity and/or authority to make a request on another’s behalf.

Requests made on another person’s behalf can only be accepted upon receipt of documentation that the requestor is an authorized agent, parent, or legal guardian of the consumer whose information is being requested. This will require the submission of a valid Power of Attorney, Birth Certificate, approved Truist authorization form, Guardianship Order, or other court order granting authority to receive information, as appropriate.

Upon submission of a request, consumers will receive an initial confirmation of receipt within 10 days. We will respond to your request within 45 days (unless an extension of up to 45 additional days is requested, upon which the consumer will receive notice and an explanation for the extension).

Please note Truist is also a service provider to business clients and may not fulfill requests pertaining to personal information we process on their behalf. For example, we offer payroll services to small businesses or payment processing services to retail merchants. If you are an employee, customer, representative, or otherwise associated with one of these clients, we encourage you to reach out to the business directly to exercise your rights specific to this information.

### Opt Out Preference Signals

Your internet browser may give you more control over your privacy preferences via a Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal. This is a setting in your browser that notifies the websites you visit of your preferences to opt out of selling or sharing your personal information under California law. If you have opted out via the GPC signal, Truist sites will recognize this signal and process your preference automatically as it pertains to tags, cookies and pixels that collect personal information when you visit Truist.com. Please note, you will need to enable the signal on each browser that you use, as the signal is processed at the browser-level and is not applied if you visit Truist.com from a different browser or device that does not have the GPC signal enabled.  When you have authenticated into Truist Privacy Center from a browser with GPC enabled, Truist will automatically apply that opt out preference to offline data that we have about you. To opt out without GPC enabled, see the section Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale/Sharing above.  

### Non-Discrimination

The submission of any CCPA request will have no impact on the service and/or pricing you receive from Truist. It will not result in any denial of goods or services, or different prices, rates or quality of goods or services, nor will it result in retaliation against an employee, applicant, or independent contractor.

### Consumers Under 16 Years of Age

Truist products and services are not intended for consumers under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 without consent. Truist does not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under the age of 16 or share such information for cross-contextual advertising.

### Automated Decision-making

You have the right to opt out of Truist’s use of your personal information for certain automated decision-making and/or profiling purposes. This opt out can be accomplished by visiting the Truist [Privacy Center](https://privacycenter.truist.com/).

### Privacy Center for Requests and Updating Preferences

Through the Truist [Privacy Center](https://privacycenter.truist.com/), you can submit requests to see, delete and edit information we’ve collected and update your sharing and marketing preferences.
