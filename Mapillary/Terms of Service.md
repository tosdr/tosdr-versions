You are responsible for any activities on your account unless unauthorized access is obtained solely because of a failure of our security measures. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames, including on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim, including trademark rights, in those usernames.
    

### 3\. Licenses

1. The Mapillary Services, and all data and content included therein, including User Content as defined below, (collectively, “Content”) are owned by Mapillary or our licensors and are protected under relevant intellectual property laws. Except as explicitly stated in these Terms, all rights in and to the Mapillary Services are reserved by us or our licensors. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you are hereby granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Mapillary Services (excluding User Content, which is subject to Section 3(b) below), including to install our mobile apps on a device you own or control. Any use of the Mapillary Services for commercial purposes is subject to the additional terms in Section 12 below.

Your use of any User Content provided by other users is subject to the [Creative Commons Share Alike (CC BY-SA) license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), unless we indicate otherwise. For instance, we may provide access to certain User Content (alone or in combination with other data sets) under a separate set of license terms (such as the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial Share Alike (CC BY-NC-SA license). You agree to comply with the license terms that apply to any of the data sets we make available via the Mapillary Services, including User Content provided by other users.

When you upload or otherwise contribute User Content on or through the Mapillary Services, you understand that your User Content and any associated information (such as your username, profile photo, and bio) may be visible to others. To the extent possible under applicable law, you waive any moral, neighboring or other rights you may have (including rights in the nature of attribution, integrity, privacy, paternity, and rights to object to derogatory treatment) in your User Content that would otherwise preclude us from exercising our rights under the license granted by you in this Section.

Subject to the prohibitions listed above, if you use the Mapillary Services while operating a vehicle you must drive in a careful and responsible way, and always follow any applicable traffic laws. Driving can be dangerous, and use of the Mapillary Services while driving is entirely at your own risk.
3. You may not create, post, store or share any User Content that is confidential, violates these Terms, or for which you do not have all the rights necessary to grant us and users the license described in Section 4 above. You may not create, post, store or share any User Content that:

4. We can remove, block, or restrict Content that is in breach of these provisions. In addition, if you breach these provisions, we may restrict your use of the Mapillary Services in whole or in part. We may use various procedures, measures and tools to moderate content on the Mapillary Services on the basis of these Terms, including the use of both technology and human review teams to detect, review and take action on content that is illegal or violates these Terms. If we remove, block, or restrict Content for violations of these Terms, or restrict your use of the Mapillary Services in whole or in part, we will attempt to notify you of this and the reason(s) why, unless notice is not required or prohibited by applicable law.
5. Failure to enforce this section in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce it in other instances. In addition, this Section 5 does not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Mapillary Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.

### 6\. Notifications Regarding Content Blurring

1. We use technology designed to blur the faces of individuals and vehicle license plates. If you observe any Content on the Mapillary Services that reveals faces, license plates, or other information that may contain personal information, use the content flagging tools in the Mapillary Services to alert us so that we may review and address the issue, as appropriate. Alternatively, you may contact us at [support@mapillary.zendesk.com](mailto:support@mapillary.zendesk.com) to alert us to other issues related to blurring of Content.

### 10\. Third-Party Content

1. We may provide information about third-party products, services, activities or events, or we may allow third parties to make their content and information available on or through the Mapillary Services (collectively, “Third-Party Content”). We provide Third-Party Content as a service to those interested in such Third-Party Content. Your dealings or correspondence with third parties and your use of or interaction with any Third-Party Content are solely between you and the third party. Mapillary does not control or endorse any Third-Party Content, and can make no guarantee of its accuracy. You are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable terms that govern Third-Party Content.
    

### 11\. Additional Terms for Developers

1. Certain Mapillary Services, including the Mapillary API, Mapillary vector tiles, and the MapillaryJS library, (“Developer Tools”) are tools we offer to software developers who work on building map platforms, geospatial tools, and location-based services (“Developer”). If you are a Developer, this Section 11 applies to you. You must [register any application](https://www.mapillary.com/dashboard/developers) you intend to use with our Developer Tools with us to obtain a client\_id. Each application must have a unique client\_id, and must be designed to provide products or services that materially supplement those provided via the Mapillary Services (and not to merely redistribute Content or create applications that substantially replicate the functionality of Mapillary Services). You must ensure your application is using the most current version of the Developer Tools. You may not make any promises or warranties on our behalf or allocate any responsibility to Mapillary. Mapillary reserves the right to throttle usage, revoke client\_ids, or exercise any other rights we have under these Terms if we suspect you are misusing the developer resources or if we otherwise believe necessary to protect our or any third party’s rights or interests. You authorize us to monitor your use of Developer Tools to ensure compliance with these Terms. You will not seek to block or otherwise interfere with our monitoring efforts, and you authorize us to use technical means to overcome any methods you may use to block or interfere with our monitoring. You must adhere to the attribution requirements set forth below and as applicable to any User Content provided by others that you obtain.
    
    * If you are downloading individual images and serving them from your own servers, you must attribute the image(s) by visibly displaying the [Mapillary logo](https://www.mapillary.com/press-kit) and linking back to the Mapillary homepage or corresponding Mapillary image page.
    * If you integrate data that Mapillary extracts from street-level images using the Mapillary API or our vector tiles in your application, you must attribute the source of the data by visibly displaying the [Mapillary logo](https://www.mapillary.com/press-kit) and linking back to the Mapillary homepage.
    

### 12\. Use of the Mapillary Services for Commercial Purposes

1. If you choose to use the Mapillary Services for a commercial purpose (whether as a sole proprietor or on behalf of a legal entity), the following additional terms apply:
    
    * You may use the Mapillary Services only for the following commercial purposes: (i) improvement, training, and development of products, services, maps, studies, platforms, websites, applications, software, algorithms, datasets, solutions, or technologies; and (ii) in the provision of services for or on behalf of one or more of your clients.
    * You will implement and maintain (i) technical safeguards and business processes that prohibit reidentification or unblurring of any Content, including any individual or license plate; and (ii) business processes to prevent inadvertent disclosure or release of any Content, and notify [vendor-incident@meta.com](mailto:vendor-incident@meta.com) of any incident, infraction, or other activity related to the foregoing i and/or ii that may be considered an unauthorized or unlawful processing of Content or User Content.
    

### 13\. Information about OpenStreetMap and the Overture Maps Foundation

1. As part of our commitment to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and the [Overture Maps Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/), we permit you and others to use the Mapillary Services, and all Content included therein, to develop, edit and contribute content to OpenStreetMap or the Overture Maps Foundation. Your contributions to OpenStreetMap or the Overture Maps Foundation are subject to each entity’s terms, and you agree to comply with those terms.
    

### 14\. Indemnification

1. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Mapillary and our subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (collectively, the “Mapillary Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of the Mapillary Services; (b) your User Content or Feedback; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); or (e) your conduct in connection with the Mapillary Services. You agree to promptly notify Mapillary Parties of any third-party Claims, cooperate with Mapillary Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including attorneys’ fees). You also agree that the Mapillary Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at Mapillary’s sole option, of any third-party Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a separate written agreement between you and Mapillary or the other Mapillary Parties.
    

### 15\. Warranty

1. Mapillary provides the Mapillary Services using reasonable skill and care. If we do not meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to inform us and we will work with you to try to resolve the issue.
    

### 16\. Disclaimers

1. Other than as set out in Section 15 and as provided under applicable laws, Mapillary does not make any commitments about the Content, the specific functions of the Mapillary Services or their reliability, availability or ability to meet your needs. In addition, unless required by law, we don’t provide implied warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
    

### 17\. Limitation of Liability

1. Subject to Section 17(c), neither Mapillary nor the other Mapillary Parties will be responsible (under these Terms or for our negligence) for losses that were caused by your breach of these Terms or which were beyond our control and which we could avoid through appropriate actions. If we fail to comply with these Terms, we or the other Mapillary Parties will only be responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill. However, we and the other Mapillary Parties are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable, and, if the Mapillary Services are not performed with reasonable care and skill, you agree to give us a reasonable opportunity to re-perform them for you before filing a claim. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both Mapillary and you knew it might happen.
    
2. If you use the Mapillary Services for any commercial purpose: (i) we and the other Mapillary Parties will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity; (ii) the total liability of Mapillary and the other Mapillary Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Mapillary Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the greater of $100 or the amount paid by you to use the Mapillary Services during the 12 months preceding the claim; and (iii) if the Mapillary Services are not performed with reasonable care and skill, you agree to give us the opportunity to re-perform them and that this re-performance will be your sole and exclusive remedy for that failure.
    
3. The limitations set forth in this Section 17 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud (including fraudulent misrepresentation) or intentional misconduct of Mapillary or the other Mapillary Parties or for personal injury, death or property damage caused by the Mapillary Services, or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.
    

### 18\. Transfer and Processing Data

1. In order for us to provide the Mapillary Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in Sweden, the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.
    

### 19\. Disputes, Governing Law and Venue

1. Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Mapillary Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Sweden. However, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of your local jurisdiction, and nothing in these Terms affects your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law. You or we may bring a legal action relating to these Terms or our relationship in the courts of Sweden or in the courts located in your country of residence. The European Commission provides for an [online dispute resolution platform](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). You are free to accept or reject the use of mediation and, in case of mediation, each party is free to accept or reject the solution proposed by the mediator.
    

### 20\. Modifying and Terminating our Services

1. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Mapillary Services if you materially or repeatedly breach these Terms, if we are required to do so by law or court order, or if we reasonably believe your conduct creates possible liability or risk of harm to us or any other party that we could not reasonably avoid without such suspension. We may also suspend your account for a period of up to 90 days while we investigate if any of these conditions are present. We will attempt to notify you by email with the reason for our action unless notice is not required or prohibited by applicable law.. If you are unable to access the Mapillary Services and have not received notice explaining why, please contact our customer support for more information through the contact information referenced below.
    
2. If reasonably possible, we will notify you in advance before discontinuing all or a portion of the Mapillary Services or making changes that have a material adverse impact on your use of the Mapillary Services. However, we reserve the right to make changes without notice in certain circumstances, such as to improve security, help combat fraud or abuse, or comply with the law.
    

### 21\. Terms for Government Users

1. If the Mapillary Services are acquired or used by any agency of the U.S. Government, such agency acknowledges that (a) the Mapillary Services constitute “commercial computer software” or “commercial computer software documentation” for purposes of 48 C.F.R. §12.212 and 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable; and (b) such agency’s rights are limited to those specifically granted under these Terms (or any applicable additional license terms we provide).
    

### 22\. Export Compliance

1. All or part of the Mapillary Services may be subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws (“Export Controls”). You will abide by all Export Controls as they relate to your access and use of the Mapillary Services. You may not access or use the Mapillary Services if you are located in a jurisdiction where the provision of our Services is prohibited by law (a “Prohibited Jurisdiction”), and you may not provide access to our Services to any government, entity or individual located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction. You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
    

### 23\. Additional Terms and Amendments

1. We may supply different or additional terms in relation to some of the Mapillary Services (such as specific research data sets). If there is a conflict between these Terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict. Those additional terms will form part of these Terms only if they incorporate these Terms by reference. If not, they will be a separate, independent agreement.
    
2. We may make changes to these Terms (including any incorporated additional terms) from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending an email, providing a notice through the Mapillary Services or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of the Mapillary Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Mapillary Services.
    

### 24\. Severability

1. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    

### 25\. Miscellaneous

1. Nothing in these Terms will limit any of our obligations or your rights under applicable data protection or other laws that cannot be limited by contract. In particular, these Terms do not deprive consumers of the level of protection granted according to Article 6 EU Regulation 593/2008 (so-called “Rome I Regulation”) and EU Regulation 1215/2012.
    
2. The failure of Mapillary to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
    
3. These Terms reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, representations, statements and understandings of the parties.
    
4. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.”
    
5. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. Nothing herein will be deemed to create an agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship of any kind between you and Mapillary.
    
6. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.
    
7. The parties hereto confirm that they have requested that these Terms and any Additional Terms, be drafted in English.
    

### 26\. Additional Terms for iOS Users

The following terms also apply if you are accessing or using one of our mobile apps (an “App”) on an Apple Inc. (“Apple”) branded mobile device.

1. These Terms are concluded between Mapillary and you only, and not with Apple, and, as between Apple and us, we are solely responsible for the App and the Content.
    
2. The license granted to you for the App under these Terms is limited to a non-transferable license to use the App on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Apple Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Service, except that such App may be accessed, acquired, and used by other accounts associated with the purchaser via “Family Sharing” or volume purchasing.
    
3. Mapillary is not obligated to provide any support or maintenance services for the App, provided that we are solely responsible for such services to the extent required under applicable law. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
    
4. Subject to Section 16 of the Terms, we are solely responsible for any warranties, whether express or implied by law. Subject to Section 16 of these Terms, in the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any) for the App; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be our sole responsibility.
    
5. Subject to Section 17 of the Terms, we, and not Apple, are responsible for addressing any claims of yours or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of that App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
    
6. Subject to Section 17 of the Terms, in the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of that App infringes any third party’s intellectual property rights, we, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.
    
7. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, Apple and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
