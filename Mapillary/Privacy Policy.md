Effective from 15 February 2024

This Privacy Policy explains how Mapillary, offered by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (“Mapillary,” “we,” or “us”) collect, use, and share information about you.

### Imagery Collected and Shared by Users via our Services

We offer our users tools to collect and upload street-level imagery to our Services.

We use technology designed to blur any faces and license plates our algorithms detect within the imagery to help reduce privacy impact. Following this process, the imagery is typically published via our Services for other users to use in accordance with our [terms](https://www.mapillary.com/terms).

Our terms require users to notify us if they observe any imagery on the Services that may contain personal data. If you detect any potential privacy concerns with any of the imagery available via the Services, please contact us at [support@mapillary.zendesk.com](mailto:support@mapillary.zendesk.com).

For example, you share information directly with us when you create an account, provide mapping content or other content through our Services, participate in our forums, comment on or flag content posted by other users, participate in a challenge, download content (such as a research data set), request support, comment on our blog posts, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect about you include your name, email address, account credentials, postal address, phone number, profile photo, profile bio, and any other information you choose to provide.

* Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We (and our service providers) use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.mapillary.com/cookies) and the Your Choices section below.
    

Information We Collect from Other Sources

We obtain information from third-party sources. For example, if you create or log into your Mapillary account through another platform (such as Facebook or Google), we will have access to certain information from that platform, such as your profile photo and language preference, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such platform.

### Sharing of Information

We share information about you in the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this policy:

* With vendors, service providers, and affiliates (as specified below) that perform services for us, such as companies that assist us with web hosting, image blurring, annotation and processing, email delivery, and customer service. Such sharing occurs between and among Mapillary and our current and future parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
    
* If we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
    
* If we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of Mapillary or others.
    
* In connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
    
* With your consent or at your direction. For example, if you submit imagery or post content in a public area of our Services, we share this information (such as through our APIs or publicly on our Services). Additionally, if you choose to use integrations we offer on our Services, we may share certain information with the integration partners, including Mapbox and OpenStreetMap.
    

We also share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

### Legal Basis for Processing

When we process your personal data, we do so in reliance on the following lawful bases:

* To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., to provide image datasets for research use or other products and services you request).
    
* When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data to operate our business or protect our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain, and improve our products and services, including our blurring algorithms, to develop new products and services, conduct data analytics, and communicate with you).
    
* To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents).
    
* When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive marketing communications from us). When consent is the legal basis for processing your personal data, you may withdraw such consent at any time.
    

### Data Retention

We will retain content you have posted to the Services (like imagery you share, forum posts, or comments you post about other users’ content), but upon request, we can remove your username and other identifying information from this retained content. We store other personal data for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our compliance obligations.

### Transfer of Information to the United States and Other Countries

We may process Information on servers located in a number of countries. We will only transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a third country, pursuant to a data transfer mechanism authorized under applicable law. For example, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal data originating from those countries to third countries (such as the U.S.) through a series of intercompany agreements based on the Standard Contractual Clauses. You may request a copy of the legal safeguards we have put in place to safeguard your transferred personal data by contacting us at [privacy@mapillary.com](mailto:privacy@mapillary.com) .
