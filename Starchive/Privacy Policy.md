PRIVACY NOTICE
==============

**Effective Date: March 1, 2023**

Digital ReLab, LLC (“Digital ReLab”) cares about online privacy and wants you to know how we collect, use, share, and protect information about you and the choices you have regarding our use of your information. If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Notice, please email us at [privacy@starchive.io](mailto:privacy@starchive.io)**.**  This Privacy Notice applies to anyone who visits or uses any Digital ReLab website (singularly and collectively referred to herein as the “Website”), or uses, subscribes to, or licenses any Digital ReLab goods or services, including without limitation any of our software solutions, APIs, mobile applications, television applications, or other such service made available through Digital ReLab that may require the collection of your personal information (the “Services”).

**PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY NOTICE CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW WE WILL TREAT IT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES, YOUR CHOICE IS NOT TO USE OUR WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES.**  

We may change or add to this Privacy Notice from time to time, so we encourage you to review it periodically. The most recent version of the Privacy Notice will be posted on the Website, with the “Revised Date” posted at the top of the Policy. The Revised Date will change if we make any material changes to our Privacy Notice or how we handle your personal information.  If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your PII, we will post a more prominent notice (including, for certain Services, email notification of Privacy Notice changes where possible) in advance of any such change for thirty (30) days if feasible.  Your continued use of this Website or the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acknowledgement and acceptance of those changes.

**SCOPE.**  This Privacy Notice applies to the collection of personal information from users of the Website or Services, including any updated and new products or services that may be offered in the future by Digital ReLab.  It relates to information we collect from you, including personally identifying information (also referred to as “PII”) and information that does not identify you personally. PII may include, for example, some or all of the following: your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, user name, and password. By agreeing to any of our subscription agreements or Terms of Use, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our privacy practices. 

**INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USED BY DIGITAL RELAB.**  When users sign up for an account or submit information via the Website or the Services, Digital ReLab may collect user-submitted information such as name, profile photograph, social media account information, mailing address, telephone number, and email address. Digital ReLab uses that information to authenticate users and to send notifications to users relating to the Website, Services, or related materials or opportunities.

As is standard practice, Digital ReLab may also log non-personally identifying information, including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, browser type, and device type from the Website and through the Services. This data is used to improve the services, analyze trends, administer the Website and Services, track users’ movements while using the Website or Services, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

In addition, Digital ReLab uses technological measures, such as pixel tags – tiny graphic images – to tell us what parts of the Website or Services have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches users perform. These technological measures also enable us to send email messages in a format that users can read, and they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we are only sending messages that are of interest to our users.

Digital ReLab may also use a user’s email address to send updates, newsletters, or news regarding the Services. Digital ReLab may send email messages which use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Website and Services. When a user clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. Digital ReLab may track this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our user communications. If you prefer not to be tracked you may simply avoid clicking the text or graphic links in the email. Users who no longer wish to receive promotional messages or updates may do so by opting-out. To opt-out, click the “unsubscribe” link in the email or reply with the word “unsubscribe” in the subject line of the email. 

We use the information that we collect to develop, deliver, and improve our Website, Services, and other offerings. In cases where you use a mobile device to access the Website and use the Services, we may receive information about the location of your device. 

**Rights in respect of your Information.** The laws of some countries grant particular rights in respect of personal information. Individuals in certain countries, including the European Union, United Kingdom, and Brazil have the right to:

* Request access to their information;

* Request that their information be deleted or that we restrict access to it;
* Request a structured electronic version of their information; and
* Object to our use of their information.

Should you wish to make a request in respect of your personal information please contact us at [privacy@starchive.io.](mailto:privacy@starchive.io) You also have the right to object to our processing of personal data about you in for marketing purposes and we will stop processing data for that purpose.

Digital ReLab takes commercially reasonable precautions to ensure that account information is kept private, but keeping your information secure also depends on you. Sharing your account information with others is prohibited, and we also recommend that you avoid logging in to your account on an unsecured device.    

Digital ReLab uses reasonable measures such as encryption to protect private information stored within our database against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, and we restrict access to such private information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our member service personnel and technical staff.  For example, when you enter sensitive information on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology, which creates an encrypted connection between you and our systems. 

Please note that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and Digital ReLab cannot guarantee the security of user account information.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information. In most cases, users will access their account via a secure authentication link or token.  Users are urged to also take precautions to protect their personal data by utilizing a strong password, consisting of a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters; and using a secure web browser, when using a password to access your account. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website or in the Services.

**THIRD PARTY LOG-IN.**  If you activate your account or log in to the Website or Services using a third-party for log-in purposes, your log-in information will be subject to the privacy practices of that third-party.    If you choose to utilize third-party log-in services, please review the third-party policies carefully and know that the use of this service at your own risk.

Digital ReLab reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of Digital ReLab or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. Digital ReLab takes your privacy very seriously. To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared internally within Digital ReLab. We may also provide your personal information to companies that help us process information, deliver products to you, manage and enhance user data, provide user service, assess your interest in our products and Services, or conduct user research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with Digital ReLab’s policies.  Digital ReLab does not sell or rent your information to other parties.  

**SHARING OF PAYMENT INFORMATION.**  Digital ReLab utilizes a secure third-party processor called Stripe (the “Payment Processor”) to process payments.  A link to the Payment Processor’s privacy practices is available at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.  Please refer to their privacy notice for more information about their privacy and security practices.  Digital ReLab does not receive or store your payment information.  Digital ReLab may receive information regarding your zip code and country as part of the payment transaction, which Digital ReLab may use to comply with tax and other government regulations.
