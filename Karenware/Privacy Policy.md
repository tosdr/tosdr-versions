Privacy Policy
==============

Your privacy is very important to us at KarenWare.com.

That's why we make these promises:

* We will _never_ share information about you with any other person or company.We will not sell your information.
    
* We will _not_ sell your information.
    
* We will _only_ keep information that is absolutely necessary to serve you.
    
* Like most web servers, ours logs each request and the IP address of the sender. We only keep this information for a few months, or whenever it is replaced by the server -- it's only looked at by Joe when something might be wrong, and then generally only to find his own IP address to see the results of testing.
    
* If we send you an email, then our email service providers obviously do receive your email address so that they can deliver the message. As of June 2018, we may send transactional or newsletter emails to you via [HostedEmail.com, an OpenSRS.com service](https://opensrs.com/services/hosted-email/) or [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). Some emails might be sent directly from one of our servers. Regardless, there may be a record in a log file somewhere, somehow, that indicates that we sent an email to you.
    
* PayPal
    
    * KarenWare.com never receives, nor processes, nor stores your banking or card information.
        1. PayPal handles all banking transactions.
        2. All forms asking for your personal information are hosted by and should be obviously secured by PayPal from their own website, including SSL certificates in their name ONLY.
        3. You are not required to have a PayPal account to send a payment to us.
        4. You can complete your transaction as our guest if you do not want to create a PayPal account.
    * To protected your visit privacy, we ask you to confirm you want to send us money before loading any images or JavaScript from PayPal's servers.
    * Upon your confirmation, we then direct your browser to load and run PayPal's Button API code to replace our payment button images with the proper images for payment options available in your country.
    * Once PayPal's code is loaded by your browser:
        1. PayPal is responsible for respecting their own privacy policies.
        2. PayPal is responsible for respecting your [Do Not Track settings](https://allaboutdnt.com/).
    * Here is a link to the [full PayPal Privacy Policy](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full).
    * Here is a link to the [developer PayPal application policies and guidelines](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/policiesAndGuidelines/) we follow.
