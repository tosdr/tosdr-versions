Terms of use
============

Welcome to Channel 4. These Terms of Use apply to Channel 4's digital products and services (which we call "Channel 4 Services" in these terms), whether you are a registered user or just a visitor. We explain what our digital products and services cover under the section headed "What do these Channel 4 Terms of Use cover?". By accessing or using our Channel 4 Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.

**1\. Who makes the Channel 4 Services available to me?**  
The Channel 4 Services are made available to you by Channel Four Television Corporation which is a statutory corporation established under the Broadcasting Act 1990. Our postal address is 124 Horseferry Road, London SW1P 2TX ("we", "us", "our").

**2\. Why is it important to read these Terms of Use?**  
Our Terms of Use are important because they confirm both our legal commitment to you and a number of legal DOs and DONTs which you need to be aware of when you use any of the Channel 4 Services. Details relating to our use of your personal data and your rights are set out in our [Privacy Policy](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/privacy). In return, we would ask you to act in a legally responsible and respectful manner in accordance with these Terms of Use.

**3\. Should I read any other information or terms?**  
Please also read our [Privacy Policy](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/privacy "Privacy policy"), [Cookies Policy](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/cookies "Cookies policy"), [Our Policies](https://www.channel4.com/4viewers/policies-overview) and [Competition Terms](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/comp-t-and-c). Each of these policies forms part of these Terms of Use.

Additional terms may also apply to some elements of our Channel 4 Services and these will be made clear to you at the relevant page or point of access.

We also offer some helpful responses to frequently asked questions and the opportunity to contact us on our [4Viewers](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers) page.

**4\. Are there specific Terms and Conditions for Channel 4+?**  
Yes there are. The Channel 4+ Terms [can be found here](https://www.channel4.com/4viewers/channel4plus-ts-and-cs).

**5\. What do these Channel 4 Terms of Use cover?**  
These Terms of Use apply to your use of most of the digital products and services we make available. We do not provide a complete list of the digital products and services within Channel 4 Services but by way of example, they include all of our websites (Channel4.com, and other websites operated by us), the Channel 4 content viewing services, Channel 4-operated applications and our Content available through third party websites (including social networking sites). Please note that there maybe some exceptional Channel 4 digital services which are subject to different terms of use and where this is the case, you will be directed to these.

When we refer to our "Content", we mean any audio, video, text, images, trade marks, logos or other content made available to you by us and may sometimes include content which is owned or controlled by third parties which we are permitted to make available to you.

We will normally provide a link from the relevant digital product or service to this document so that you know that these Terms of Use apply.

These Terms of Use apply regardless of the sort of device you are using to access Channel 4 Services. Therefore, they will apply whether you are using a computer, laptop, mobile phone, smart phone, tablet, games console or any other device.

**6\. Is Channel 4 Content suitable for everyone and what parental control tools are available to me?**  
Our Content may contain material that you consider indecent, objectionable or which may not be suitable for young audiences. If you permit a child to use your device to view our Content (including watching Content via the live or on-demand viewing sections of Channel 4 Services), you are solely responsible for deciding whether or not such Content is appropriate for that child to view. Where relevant, parental guidance is provided (in the form of ‘G' for guidance) with additional warnings at the beginning of our video content and other guidance on non-video content (where applicable) and we would ask that you pay attention to this if you are concerned in any way.

We also offer a parental control tool on certain Channel 4 Services (by way of a 4 digit PIN). If you have enabled the 4-digit PIN, your device will not be able to play either 16 or 18 rated content (depending on the setting you choose) unless you type in the PIN. Please click here to find out more about our [Parental Controls tool](http://www.channel4.com/static/global/html/parentalContent.html).

**7\. Why does Channel 4 ask me to register?**  
By becoming a registered user, you will be able to access some parts of Channel 4 Services which are not available to other visitors. You will also be provided with a more personalised experience.  Details relating to our use of your personal data and your rights are set out in our [Privacy Policy](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/privacy)

Please note that you need to be 16 or over to become a registered user.

**8\. What do I agree to by accessing and using the Channel 4 Services?**  
By becoming a registered user of Channel 4 Services you agree that you will:

* provide a valid email address;
* not let anyone else use your account;
* keep your login details, including your password and PIN (if applicable) secret;
* only set up one account per person;
* set up your account in your own name, and use an appropriate display name. You must not seek to pass yourself off as someone else or pick a display name which is offensive, defamatory or otherwise likely to be deemed by us to be unacceptable;
* tell the truth about your age. If, for example, we don't believe that you are 16 or older, we may ask you to prove your age at any time; and
* notify us if you become aware of any unauthorised use of your account.

We may suspend or terminate your account if we reasonably believe you are breaching any of these requirements or any of the other Terms of Use. Our decision to suspend or terminate your account will be based entirely on our own best judgement.

Whether or not you are a registered user, when using Channel 4 Services  you must always act honestly and appropriately. Unacceptable behaviour includes being abusive, offensive, defamatory, infringing anyone's privacy, trolling, harassing or doing anything which would upset or be disrespectful to any other person.

**9\. What do I need to know about my registered details?**  
You will be able to access your registered details with your email address and password.

You will be able to keep your information up to date by logging in and updating your profile.

If you want to terminate your account, you can do so by clicking on ‘Close Account'. This will wipe the personal information you gave us from our systems, which means that all other information we might hold about you (such as how you have used Channel 4 Services) will be anonymised and we won't be able to recognise that data as yours or contact you about it. Please see our [Privacy Policy](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/privacy "Privacy policy") for more details.

**10\. I'm concerned about my personal data. What can Channel 4 use this for?**  
Please see our [Privacy Policy](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/privacy) and [Cookies Policy](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/cookies) which explain what information we collect about you, how we use this, and your rights.

**11\. Can I copy stuff from Channel 4 Services?**  
Apart from adverts and user content, all of the Content on Channel 4 Services belongs to us and/or our production company, digital or studio partners.

Whilst we have no objection to you printing out extracts or a page of text from Channel 4 Services for your own personal use, you must not copy or reproduce or otherwise publish large sections of our Content or, for example, an entire website. Furthermore, you are not permitted to embed, upload or make any of the digital products and services within Channel 4 Services available via any third party platform, website or service without prior consent.

You are not permitted to use any part of Channel 4 Services for commercial purposes. For example, you must not copy and reproduce our Content for use on your own advertiser funded website or attempt to commercialise or attempt to sell access to our Content in any way. Your use of any of our Channel 4 Services such as the Channel 4-operated "Channel 4  Application" is for your own personal use and access is limited to your chosen device, and you must not exhibit any Content or any part of the Channel 4 Services in any public place.

Without limitation, you shall not use (and you shall also not facilitate, authorise or permit the use of) the Channel 4 Services (including, any caption information, keywords or other associated metadata) for any other purpose without our prior written approval - this includes, without limitation, that you shall not use, copy, scrape, reproduce, alter, modify, collect, mine and/or extract the Channel 4 Services: (a) for any machine learning, machine learning language models and/or artificial intelligence-related purposes (including the training or development of such technologies); (b) for any text and data aggregation, analysis or mining purposes (including to generate any patterns, trends or correlations); or (c) with any machine learning and/or artificial intelligence technologies to generate any data or content or to synthesise or combine with any other data or content; or (d) for any commercial use.

Other than as expressly set out in these terms and conditions, or otherwise approved in writing by us, you shall also not use, or facilitate, authorise or permit the use of, any (i) “robot”, “bot”, “spider”, “scraper”, “crawler” or (ii) other automated device, program, technique, tool, process, algorithm or method (whether for data gathering, mining, collection, reading, scraping, extraction or other purposes), in each case, on or in relation to the Channel 4 Services.

It is really important that our Channel 4 brand is fully protected from misuse. Our trade marks and logos are designed to let people know that the service they are getting is provided by Channel 4. Therefore, you must not copy, reproduce or otherwise publish any of our trade marks or logos without authorisation.

Making our programmes available on unauthorised websites or software applications is against the law. There are particular laws in force about sharing content without permission on peer-to-peer networks and it is important that you do not do this.

Please consider that even though most of our Content is available to you for free, we are able to generate revenue by selling advertising space in and around it. Any person watching one of our programmes on an unauthorised website, platform or service, represents lost advertising revenue to Channel 4 which we need in order to fund Channel 4 Services and to make our programmes available to you.

Our Content may be streamed or downloaded depending on which digital products and services you are using. Please see the section headed "How can I download Content?" for more information on downloading.  We may use content security technology or use other content protection measures. You agree that you will not circumvent, try to adjust or otherwise interfere with our security technology for any reason.

Educational establishments which have taken out a licence with the Educational Recordings Agency ("ERA") can access recordings of our content under the terms of that ERA licence.

**12\. Is Channel 4 responsible for the adverts provided on their Channel 4 Services?**  
Advertisements and promotions on Channel 4 Services may be targeted or personalized to you based on personal information. Our Privacy Policy governs the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in this regard.

We do not make any endorsement, guarantee, representation or recommendation about any advertisers' or sponsors' products or services. Channel 4 is not responsible for your interaction with those advertisers or their products and services.

**13\. Is Channel 4 responsible for third party websites when it provides a link to these?**  
Sometimes we provide links to websites and resources operated by third parties. We are not responsible or liable for anything that happens to you when you visit these third party websites and resources. Your access to and use of these third party websites will be governed by  their own terms of use and privacy policy, so you will need to be aware of these. Furthermore, unless stated otherwise, Channel 4 does not endorse any third party website to which it provides a link.

Sometimes, third party websites provide links to our Content. This does not mean that we have any relationship with that website and you should be careful about assuming Channel 4's association or affiliation to anyone else, especially where the existence of that relationship has not been confirmed by us.

**14\. Will the Channel 4 Services change?**  
The Content on Channel 4 Services will change regularly, meaning new programmes and channels may become available while other content will stop being available. We may also make updates and changes to the features and functionalities of the Channel 4 Services from time to time, including in light of new legal requirements, to make technical or security updates or to reflect changes to our business. We will try to give you notice of any materially detrimental changes to Channel 4 Services.

To get the best experience and to ensure Channel 4 operates correctly, we recommend that you accept any updates to Channel 4 applications as and when they become available.

**15\. Are these Terms of Use still applicable when I connect to Channel 4 Services from a social networking service?**  
When you connect to Channel 4 Services from a social networking service, these Terms of Use will still apply although you need to be aware that the social networking service's own terms of use (and privacy and cookie policies) may also apply.

**16\. How can I download Content?**  
Content can be downloaded depending on which device or website you are using to access Channel 4 Services. To be able to download our Content, you must be a registered user and logged in to your account at the time of download.

Content is available to download for a minimum of 30 days. Once downloaded to your device, you will have up to a maximum of 7 days to watch that Content. After the relevant period of time for watching the Content has expired, the Content will be automatically deleted from your device. If the Content is still available to download you can download it again. Due to our agreements with our production company, digital or studio partners, please note that not all of our Content will be available for you to download.  Please also be aware that advertising around Content is current at the point of download; however, once Content has been downloaded to your device, any offers and promotions featured within the advertising may no longer be in effect.

**17\. Do I need to pay Channel 4 to watch programmes?**  
Unless specifically indicated, there is no charge to watch our video content. However, you may need to meet your internet service provider's charges in order to have access to the required amount of bandwidth.

You do need to be covered by a valid TV Licence if you watch any TV channel on any device at the same time as it is being broadcast on TV. This includes watching live TV on devices such as a computer, laptop, mobile phone, smart phone or tablet. Further information about this is available on the [TV Licensing website](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/ "tv"). Accordingly, you will need to be covered by a valid TV Licence if you use our "Live TV" viewing service to watch our channels online when they are live simulcasts of broadcast channels (but not for watching on demand programmes).

**18\. What are the rules I need to know about user content?**  
We provide users and viewers with an opportunity to participate in shared activity such as contributing to our programmes (e.g. via calls to action on our shows) and online projects via online comments, blogs, social media channels, email and other interactive activity.

Your participation in and contribution to any such shared activity is governed by and subject to your compliance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.channel4.com/4viewers/privacy), [Cookies Policy](https://www.channel4.com/4viewers/cookies) and [Competition Terms](https://www.channel4.com/4viewers/comp-t-and-c).

You will own your user content and may continue to use it, but by posting or submitting this content to us, you allow us (and our third party partners) irrevocably to use your content at our discretion in any media (including on television and online) throughout the world at any time without further liability or payment to you, including to promote our Channel 4 Services or Content.

Where we do use your user content, we also have the right to change or edit this content. We might also show your name (and, if provided to us, your photograph) with your contribution, in accordance with our Privacy Policy. If you would rather that we did not use your user content, we would kindly ask that you do not post or otherwise submit any user content to us.

We reserve the right to remove, modify or delete any material you submit to us on becoming aware of any violation of these Terms of Use, or for legal, security or other reasons, or because the relevant material is unlawful or objectionable.

**19\. I would like to post links to Channel 4 content on my website, or other social network account like Facebook or Twitter. Is this ok?**  
Some clips available on Channel 4 Services feature an embed code which allows you to display that clip on your website or social networking page ("embeddable content").

When using our embeddable content you must not:

* copy, re-publish, edit, alter, add to or use the embeddable content, embed code or embeddable player in any other way;
* charge users for access to the embeddable content, or use the embeddable content as a means to secure advertising or other revenue (or any form of commercial benefit) in any other way;
* directly or indirectly suggest any endorsement or approval by us of your website or page or any non-Channel 4 entity, product or content or any views expressed;
* use the embeddable content in any way that could bring Channel 4 into disrepute or otherwise cause any loss or damage to Channel 4; and/or
* use the embeddable content on any websites or pages that:
* contain pornography or sexually explicit content;
* contain offensive text or images;
* are hate sites (on grounds of race, religion, gender, disability, age or sexual orientation);
* contain gratuitous violence; and/or
* condone or encourage unlawful acts.

**20\. What technical stuff do I need to know about?**  
We will try to ensure Channel 4 is available to you at all times. However, we do not provide any guarantees about its availability or that we will be able to quickly resolve any technical problems that arise.

Whilst we seek to make Channel 4 available as widely as possible, some features and functionality may not work on all devices and operating systems.

Please note that matters relating to the internet generally, such as broadband availability, connections and speed and other matters outside of our control may affect the quality and availability of Channel 4, its features and functionality and your ability to participate in some Channel 4 activities. We take no responsibility for these sorts of matters.

To watch our video content on your computer or other device will need to meet the [minimum operating requirements](https://origin-corporate.channel4.com/4viewers/faqs/channel-4/what-are-minimum-operating-requirements-stream-content-channel-4).

If you have any problems watching or viewing our Content, please go to our video Help and [FAQ](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/faqs) page for further guidance.

Whilst we will take reasonable steps to ensure that our Content is virus free, we cannot guarantee this. Accordingly, you must take your own precautions in this regard (such as using anti-virus software).

**21\. What do I need to know about applying online to be on Channel 4 programmes?**  
Sometimes, we facilitate the opportunity to appear on our programmes via an online portal and application form. We usually operate this on behalf of our production company partners who make our programmes for us. In these cases, the completed application forms will be sent to the relevant production company who will be responsible for processing your application.

Typically you will need to be 18+ in order to apply to appear on one of our programmes, but our production company partners will make this clear to you on the application form.

Any other specific issues relating to eligibility will also be set out in the application form.

Please note that submitting an application does not give you any legal rights or impose any sort of obligation on Channel 4 or its production company partners. Any decisions regarding successful applications will be made in our, or our production company partner's, sole discretion.

**22\. What terms apply to Channel 4 online competitions?**  
The terms relating to our online competitions are available [here](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/comp-t-and-c).

There may be additional or different terms which relate to a specific competition being run by us, and where this is the case, we will make that clear to you.

**23\. What if I have a complaint?**  
About our programmes

If you wish to comment on one of our programmes you can contact us via the [4Viewers website](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/contact-us).

Please note that the "On Demand" video section of Channel 4 Services constitutes an on demand programme service ("ODPS"). As of January 2016 Channel 4 is regulated directly by Ofcom.

**24\. Changes to these Terms of Use**

Please note that we may change these Terms of Use from time to time to clarify them, for legal or security reasons or to reflect changes to our business, services or commercial priorities. If we change these Terms of Use in a way that will materially impact your legal rights or obligations, we will try to give you reasonable advance notice (including by posting an update on the Channel 4 Services), unless changes are urgently required due to security, legal or regulatory reasons.

Your continued use of the Channel 4 Services following any update to the Terms of Use means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you do not agree to the changes, then you must stop using the Channel 4 Services. You should review these Terms of Use regularly to check whether they have been changed or updated.

**25\. What other legal stuff do I need to know about?**  
Neither Channel 4 nor its subsidiary companies accept any liability (whether based in contract, tort or other action) for any loss caused by your use of and reliance on any information on any part of the Channel 4 Services, or any commercial or business losses, or for any loss which is caused by you and does not result from our breach of these Terms of Use. This exclusion of liability does not affect your statutory rights (please see this [advice guide](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/) for further details).

Nothing in these Terms of Use excludes our or your liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence or for fraud.

Any commentary, opinions or other material within the digital products and services available on Channel 4 streaming are not intended to amount to advice on which you should rely. If Channel 4 decides not to exercise or enforce any right that it has against you at a particular time, then this does not prevent Channel 4 from later deciding to exercise or enforce that right.

If any part of these Terms of Use is found to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court or regulator, then, where required, that part shall be deleted and the remaining parts of the Terms of Use will continue to be enforceable.

These Terms of Use do not create or infer any rights that are enforceable by any person who is not party to them.
