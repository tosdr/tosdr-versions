    4. As described further in Section XII below, RealDefense expressly disclaims any warranties of non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose. RealDefense does not warrant that the software will (i) achieve specific results, (ii) operate without interruption, or (iii) be error free. RealDefense uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect your data, but does not warrant that your data will be secure in all circumstances, foreseen and unforeseen.
    5. As described further in Section XIV below, RealDefense expressly disclaims all liability for the Software, including any loss or liability resulting from lost or compromised data caused by the Software. The Software may make changes to your computer or mobile device that may adversely affect its functionality, such as deleting system or application files identified (correctly or incorrectly) by the Software as infected or a potential concern. You acknowledge and agree to such changes to your computer or mobile device that may occur as a result of your use of the Software. In no event will RealDefense be liable for any damages, including lost profits or data, or other incidental or consequential damages, arising out of the use or inability to use the software or any data supplied therewith, even if RealDefense has been advised of the possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any other party.
    6. The Software and/or Services are not fault-tolerant and are not designed or intended for high-risk activities such as use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, including nuclear facility operations, air traffic communications systems, weapons systems, direct life support machines, or any other application where the failure of the Software or Services could lead directly to death, personal injury, loss of data, or severe physical or property damage.
3. SOFTWARE BEHAVIOR
    1. Scheduled Tasks. By installing desktop software or mobile apps produced by RealDefense you acknowledge that the products may create and run scheduled tasks on your device. Scheduled tasks are enabled by default. You can disable most scheduled tasks at any time from within the product settings. If you wish to disable ALL scheduled tasks you need to uninstall the software completely. Payment is not required to disable, enable, or amend the scheduled tasks created by any one of the RealDefense Products.
    2. Background Processes. Upon installation, RealDefense Products may set and run tasks or background processes on your computer that will auto-start upon reboot or restart of your computer's operating system. These tasks are required to check your installed software for available updates, validate your license information, monitor your computer for specific product-related items (such as privacy threats, malware infection attempts, etc.) and various other product-related tasks required for the products to operate. If you do not wish to grant the products that permission, please uninstall the products at your convenience or disable the ‘Launch at System Startup' option from within the product settings where applicable.
    3. URL Redirects/Blocked Websites. When installed, RealDefense Products may detect certain website and/or software communication attempts as malicious and block any outgoing or incoming communication between your computer and the specific website and/or IP address. This communication block is done for your safety. If you do not wish to grant the product(s) that permission, please uninstall the Product(s) at your convenience or disable the ‘Safe Browsing' feature from within the product settings where applicable. If you wish to visit/allow the blocked URL after all, please add the URL to the exclusion list of your security software.
    4. User Account Control/UAC. UAC is a security feature of Windows which helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system by prompting the user for manual approval. Certain RealDefense Products may disable the UAC prompts relating only to those RealDefense Products. At any point you can uninstall the product if you feel this is an inconvenience to you.
    5. Installing Multiple Software Products. Please note that installing multiple security products and/or utilities with overlapping coverage on devices that are not designed for high performance is not recommended, nor needed.
    6. General Software Behavior. We use commercially reasonable efforts to support and update our software so it is compatible with each new update and/or upgrade of related software, services, or operating systems that may affect or be affected by our product's behavior. From time to time, a new software patch or newly deployed version of such third party product may be released that is incompatible with our products. We cannot guarantee that our Products will work after installation of such incompatible products.
    7. Silent Software Installation. If you have downloaded any of the software products mentioned in this page, through a 3rd party bundled offer, where any RealDefense Product was included as a "software bundle", RealDefense software may be silently installed on your device, without an installation wizard, with your explicit consent and permission.
4. IDENTITY PROTECTION SERVICES
    
    1. RealDefense partners with Identity and Credit Services, Inc. ("IDCS") to provide you with comprehensive identity protection. Use of the credit monitoring and identity protection services is subject to additional terms and conditions from IDCS.
    2. Some of the Services may allow you to review a copy of your credit report and score or alerts derived from changes to your reports (the "Credit Monitoring Service"). By using the MyCleanID Product that provides the Credit Monitoring Service, you agree that you are providing written instructions and your consent in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act authorizing MyCleanID and RealDefense's service providers, including but not limited to IDCS, to obtain your consumer report information, including your credit information, from the personal credit report maintained by one or more of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion), or any other credit bureau from which RealDefense and its service providers obtains consumer information.

    6. While enrolling for the MyCleanID product, IDCS may ask you for the following types of information:
        * Contact information (such as name, address, phone number, and email address);
        * Sensitive information (such as date of birth, driver's license number and social security number);
        * Personal information to verify your identity; and
        * Financial information (such as credit card number).
    7. This information is required in order to verify your identity, charge you the agreed upon fees for our products and services, and to provide our Products to you, including communicating with third parties as necessary to provide them, such as identification verification companies, consumer reporting agencies, payment validation companies, law enforcement agencies, or other authorized parties.
    8. While we will help you with any issues relating to the Credit Monitoring Service, if you need to contact IDCS you may do so by writing to its agent at:

    6. You grant RealDefense permission to monitor and record the Remote Services, including telephone calls and online sessions for purposes of improving customer service, internal training, and internal market research. You further hereby grant RealDefense permission to use or disclose any such information as necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation, or other governmental request; to provide the Remote Services to you and to protect ourselves and/or our customers; and to enhance the types of Remote Services we may provide to you in the future.
    7. Agents providing Remote Services do not backup or restore data as part of the Remote Services, and RealDefense will have no liability for any loss or damage to information on your computer or device in connection with the Remote Services.

    5. If you decide to terminate or stop paying for the Online Backup Services, you will have ten days to remove all your accessible Data from the Online Backup Services. After the ten-day period expires, we will delete your Data.
7. THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS
    1. You acknowledge that some of the Products use software or applications that are developed by parties other than RealDefense (each a "Third Party Provider"). Third Party Providers include AnchorFree AG (developer of Hotspot Shield), Avira Operations GmbH (which provides certain features of SUPERAntiSpyware), BitDefender (developer of BitDefender Antivirus), ShieldApps (developer of MyCleanPC, MyCleanID, MyPassLock), Kaspersky Lab Switzerland GmbH (developer of VirusFix), Systweak Software (developer of MyCleanMac and GetMyDrivers), and Cyren, Inc.

9. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
    1. Your use of the Products constitutes your agreement to comply with all applicable intellectual property laws, including copyright laws. You agree not to upload, download, display, perform, transmit, or otherwise distribute any information in any format ("Content") in violation of any person's or entity's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual or proprietary rights. You also agree that you are solely responsible for any violation of any intellectual property law or any infringement of any person's or entity's intellectual property rights caused by any Content that you use or transmit by means of our Products, networks, systems, or servers, or that is used or transmitted by another person by means of our networks, systems, or servers using the Products you have licensed or purchased from RealDefense. You acknowledge that RealDefense's policy generally is to cooperate in connection with investigations and litigation involving claims of infringement of intellectual property rights.
    2. You agree not to upload, download, display, perform, transmit or otherwise distribute any Content that (i) is libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, or threatening; (ii) advocates or encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise constitute a violation of applicable law; or (iii) advertises or otherwise solicits funds or is a solicitation for the purchase or sale of goods or services. RealDefense reserves the rights to terminate your ability to upload, download, display, perform, transmit or otherwise distribute such Content; terminate your Software license and your subscription for Services; and delete any such Content from RealDefense's servers.
    3. The services provided herein are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, and other United States and foreign laws. These terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in the Products or in any RealDefense trademark, logos, and other brand features. You may not use or display any trademarks or service marks owned by RealDefense without RealDefense's prior written consent.
    4. Pursuant to Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2), notifications of claimed copyright infringement should be sent to DMCA Agent, c/o RealDefense, LLC, 150 S Los Robles Ave, Suite 400, Pasadena, CA 91101; or at DMCA@realdefen.se. If you have knowledge or evidence or in good faith believe that your or another person's or entity's copyrights are being violated, you may request that RealDefense delete, edit, or disable the infringing information by submitting a takedown request to the DMCA Agent containing the following information (the "Takedown Request"):
        1. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address;
        2. An identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
        3. The exact URL or a description of where the alleged infringing material is located;
        4. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or applicable law;
        5. An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; and
        6. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Takedown Request is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
    5. Upon receiving a valid Takedown Request, RealDefense will investigate the claims of copyright infringement and will remove content that appears to infringe the copyright or other intellectual property rights of others, and/or suspend or terminate the rights of any person who is determined to have infringed the copyrights of any other person or entity.
10. PAYMENT AND BILLING
    1. You must provide up-to-date billing information in your account. You may do so by changing your payment settings in your account profile at [https://www.ustechsupport.com/acc/subscriptions/](https://www.ustechsupport.com/acc/subscriptions/).
    2. You are responsible for all payments related to the Products. Unless we explicitly invoice and itemize tax charges, your payments will be exclusive of taxes, and it is your responsibility to ensure that all applicable taxes have been paid.
    3. To ensure that you have continuous protection, we will attempt to charge your stored payment method at the then-current price prior to your subscription’s expiration date. If the then-current price has changed, we will notify you of the then-current pricing via email prior to charging the payment method on file. For annual (or greater duration) subscriptions, we may attempt each renewal charge up to 35 days prior to the subscription expiration date. The date that your payment method is charged will depend on a handful of factors, including but not limited to date and time of first attempt, pending credit card authorizations, and card issuer declines. AUTOMATIC RENEWAL: Most of our offerings automatically renew each year or each month. For annual subscriptions, we will notify you via email to the email address we have on record prior to each annual automatic renewal. If you have purchased a pre-paid subscription, annual subscription paid monthly or trial (exceeding 31 days) that automatically renews as a paid subscription, we will notify you via email before we charge the payment method on file. If you have a monthly billed subscription without an annual commitment, you may not receive an email each month prior to the subscription charge.
    4. We will continue to bill your account until it is canceled or terminated. You may cancel your account by calling us at [(801) 857-2345](tel:+18018572345) or via online chat, email, or website contact form.
    5. Refunds for purchases of standalone Software (not provided as part of a Service) will be granted only to users who contact RealDefense within thirty days of purchase by phone at [(801) 857-2345](tel:+18018572345). While we will process your refund within ten business days, it may take your financial institution longer to post the credit to your account.
    6. Monthly and annual subscription fees are not refundable.
    7. All other charges, fees, and taxes are non-refundable unless explicitly stated.
    8. We reserve the right to discontinue a discount and/or to change price(s) or offers at any time. These changes will not affect your current subscription, but may affect the price for any renewal.
11. TERMINATION
    1. You are free to stop using the Products at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to some or all of the Products with notice to you if:
        1. You are in breach of this Agreement,
        2. You are using the Services in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or
        3. You are delinquent in meeting your payment obligations.
    2. If we do terminate your access, we will provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export your data from the Products. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we will terminate or suspend your access to the Products.
    3. In certain instances, however, we will terminate your account immediately without first providing you notice. This typically occurs if:
        1. You are in material breach of this Agreement,
        2. Providing you notice of termination would cause us legal liability or hinder our ability to service our other customers, or
        3. We are prohibited from doing so by applicable law.
12. NO WARRANTIES
    1. WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE GREAT SERVICES, BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE CAN'T GUARANTEE. THEREFORE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, REALDEFENSE AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE PRODUCTS. THE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS."
    2. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
13. INDEMNITY
    1. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless RealDefense, its parents and affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, employees, consultants, and agents from liability for any and all third-party claims, liabilities, demands, disputes, causes of action, losses, damages, and costs and expenses of any kind (collectively, "Claims") resulting from:
        1. Any use of the Products in a manner not authorized by this Agreement;
        2. Any material breach by you of the provisions in this Agreement or the Privacy Policy; and
        3. Any acts or omissions on your behalf which infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of any other person.
    2. You agree to notify RealDefense immediately if you become aware of (i) an act of infringement, violation, or misappropriation of the intellectual property of any other person, or (ii) any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security known to you.
14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
    1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, REALDEFENSE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES REALTED TO LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.
    2. THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER REALDEFENSE OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    3. IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, REALDEFENSE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

    1. Prior to starting any formal legal proceedings, we would like the chance to resolve your issue ourselves. You agree that before filing a claim against RealDefense, you will contact us, either by phone at [(801) 857-2345](tel:+18018572345) or email at support@realdefen.se. Upon receiving notice of your issue, we will attempt to resolve the issue informally. If RealDefense is unable to resolve the problem within thirty (30) days, you or RealDefense may bring a formal legal proceeding.
    2. If we cannot resolve your issue as described above, you agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of these arbitration-related provisions, including their enforceability, revocability, or validity.
    3. You acknowledge that arbitration is a substitute for litigation, and that you agree to present any dispute to the arbitrator and not a governmental agency, body, or court.
    4. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at support@realdefen.se within thirty days of first registering your account. However, if you agreed to a previous version of this Agreement that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.
    5. The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, Los Angeles, California, or any other location we agree to. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
    6. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section XV will be deemed void.
16. MISCELLANEOUS
    1. This Agreement is governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. You and RealDefense agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to this Agreement or the Products will be brought in the federal or state courts of Los Angeles County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions above. Both you and RealDefense consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.
    2. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and RealDefense with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or other terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of this Agreement. These Agreement creates no third-party beneficiary rights. You acknowledge that any adjustment or amendment to this Agreement must be in writing, signed by you and an authorized employee of RealDefense.
    3. RealDefense's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. Our rights under this Agreement survive any transfer or termination of this Agreement.
    4. You may not assign any of your rights under this Agreement, and any such attempt will be void. RealDefense may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
    5. If any part of this Agreement is held or found to be invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to be consistent with applicable law while the remaining portions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect.
