Web Browser/Cookie-Based Opt-Out

You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your

browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. There are also many programs that allow

you to manually delete your cookies.



The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving

targeted ads/interest-based advertising from us, our data partners and our other advertising

partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You may use the NAI opt-out tool

at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/, which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted

ads from us and other members. The DAA’s opt-out tool can be found

at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. EU users who have provided their consent to our use of

cookies and similar technologies to process their personal information (see the paragraph titled

RIGHTS FOR EU USERS below) can use the EDAA’s opt-out tool which can be found

at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.



The opt-out from targeted ads must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to

have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will

not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. However,

once you have opted out on one device (“Opted-Out Device”), we will not use any new data from

the Opted-Out Device to identify you on another device for interest-based advertising purposes,

and will not use data from another device for interest-based advertising purposes on the Opted-

Out Device.



If you erase or otherwise alter your cookie/device settings (including upgrading certain browsers

or devices) you may need to perform each opt-out process again, unless we can match the device

as outlined above.



Even if you opt out of targeted ads based on cookies, you may still see ads based on other general

factors such as webpage context or browser type.



Mobile Application-Based Opt-Outs

Cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. Users may opt out of certain

advertisements on mobile applications or reset advertising identifiers via their device settings.



• iOS – https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074



• Android – https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en



You may also download and set your preferences on the App Choices mobile application(s)

available in Google Play or the Apple App stores.

DO NOT TRACK



There is currently no universally recognized standard for Do Not Track signals. Accordingly, at

this time, cookies used on our website and used in providing our services do not respond to any

Do Not Track signals or browser settings. You may opt-out of receiving cookies by adjusting your

web browser settings to reject cookies.
