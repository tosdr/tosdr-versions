Mobile Terms of Service

4Patriots LLC

Last updated: July 21, 2023

  

The 4Patriots LLC mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by 4Patriots LLC (“4Patriots LLC”, “we”, or “us”). Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Mobile Terms”). We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.

  

By consenting to 4Patriots LLC’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive recurring SMS/text messages from and on behalf of 4Patriots LLC through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other technology. Service-related messages may include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).

  

You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and your consent is not a condition of any purchase with 4Patriots LLC. Your participation in this program is completely voluntary.

  

We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider.

  

You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to +18444971543 or click the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation text message. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If you have subscribed to other 4Patriots LLC mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires otherwise, you will need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their respective mobile terms.

  

For Service support or assistance, text HELP to +18444971543 or email [help@4patriots.com](mailto:help@4patriots.com).

  

We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and will notify you of these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.

  

The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the program with your new number.

  

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any information sent through the Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance on the information or Service.

  

We respect your right to privacy. To see how we collect and use your personal information, please see our [Privacy Notice](https://4patriots.com/pages/privacy-policy).

PROMISE TO PAY:

In return for the products and goods provided to you under installment payment plans, you promise to pay us the total of installment payments, including any finance charges provided for as specified in your purchase in the payment schedule provided to you. In addition, you agree to pay us any other amounts you may owe us under the terms of your purchase. You agree to make each payment on or before the close of business on its due date as set forth in the payment schedule. The payment schedule provided to you assumes all of your payments are made on time. If you are late making a payment, the amount of your last payment may be greater than disclosed in the payment schedule and the total of payments may be greater than disclosed when you purchased the products and goods.

  

PAYMENT METHODS:

In return for the products and goods provided to you under installment payment plans, you are required to maintain a valid credit card on file with us while you owe money under your installment payment plan. You may change your payment card on file with us at any time by contacting us at 1-615-988-4505 or help@4patriots.com. We are not responsible for payment delays that may occur as a result of bank holidays, the processing schedule of your credit card company, bank or credit card processing errors, or other events beyond our control.

  

APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS:

Payments are credited to your account on the business day they are received, provided we receive your payment before 4:00 p.m. CST. All payments received after 4:00 p.m. CST will be credited no later than the next business day. We will apply your payments first to any accrued but unpaid payments, and then to the next scheduled payment, or any other principal amounts outstanding, if any.

  

DEFAULT:

You are in default of your installment payment plan if you: (a) you provide false or misleading information about yourself, (b) you fail to make a required payment by the payment due date or if your payment is returned to us for any reason and you fail to successfully re-deliver the required payment to us by the payment due date, (c) you file for bankruptcy or become a debtor under applicable bankruptcy laws, or (d) you otherwise fail to comply with a material provision of your purchase agreement (each, a "Default").

  

CONSEQUENCES OF DEFAULT:

If any Default occurs, and you fail to cure the Default within a reasonable time, we may, at our option, require you to immediately pay us everything you owe us under your installment payment plan and accelerate any future installments, and we may pursue all legally available means to collect what you owe us, including designating your account as past due and placing it in collection. By taking these actions, we do not give up our right to use another way to collect the money you owe us later. Our delay or failure to exercise any of our rights under the purchase agreement or applicable law is not a waiver of our rights. Any waiver by us of any provision of this purchase agreement on any one occasion will not be a waiver on any other occasion. We may report information about a Default and your performance under your installment payment plan to consumer reporting agencies, in accordance with applicable legal requirements. Late payments, missed payments, or other things you do may be reflected on your credit report. If we permit you to make payments on a modified payment plan, and, if you fail to make those payments, we will consider you to be in Default.

  

COLLECTION:

You understand that, if we are required to engage an attorney to collect any amounts due under your installment payment plan, you will be required to pay reasonable attorney fees, court costs and other related fees and costs, unless prohibited by applicable law.

  

PREPAYMENT:

You may prepay all or any part of the amounts you owe on your installment payment plan at any time and without penalty.

  

YOUR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE:

You acknowledge and agree that when you submit your order to purchase products and goods on our website, you are providing your approval and electronic signature to this purchase agreement and the terms and conditions therein. By electronically signing, you are agreeing to all the terms and conditions in this agreement and certifying that all information you have provided is complete and accurate. You agree that your electronic signature will have the same force and effect, and will bind you to this agreement to the same extent as a physical signature would. You also agree that this agreement and all related documents are electronic records and that, as such, they may be transferred, authenticated, stored, and transmitted by electronic means.

  

ASSIGNMENT:

This agreement may not be assigned by you. We may assign or transfer this agreement and our related rights and obligations without your consent and without notice to you.

  

GOVERNING LAW:

This Agreement will be governed by federal law, and to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Tennessee. The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern this agreement and this choice of governing law will not change regardless of your or our change of location.

What is considered a “damaged” package:

Dispute Resolution

These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee and any dispute shall be subject to binding arbitration in Nashville, Tennessee.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law.

Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon COMPANY actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to COMPANY a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. COMPANY's Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement or counter notices can be reached as follows: help@4patriots.com.
