The Cutting Room Floor:Privacy policy
=====================================

From The Cutting Room Floor

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head) [Jump to search](#p-search)

The Cutting Room Floor has no formal privacy policy. Those are a lot of legalese, and we don't have the money or the lawyers for that.

**What data we do store is limited, and only kept as needed:**

* All contributions made (edits, uploads, etc.) are attributed to the user who does so, and are publicly logged (with [rare exceptions](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:RevisionDelete "mw:Manual:RevisionDelete"))
* When you visit this website, we log your IP address, your browser, and what page referred you, if any.
* When you create an account, you also provide:
    * Your username. This is displayed across the wiki, and used for crediting and attribution.
    * Your email address (optional). This is used if you opt in to features like watch lists and change notices, and is used for resetting your password.
    * Your "real name" (optional). MediaWiki uses this in place of your username in some areas. It does not have to be your actual real name.
    * Additional information you provide after creating an account, your preferences, settings, etc.

**We do not sell your personal information, nor do we provide it to third parties.**

The Cutting Room Floor does not use any advertising platforms or analytics tools. The best privacy policy is simply not needing one.
