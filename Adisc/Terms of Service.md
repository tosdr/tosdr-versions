These are the rules of ADISC.  
They exist to keep our community safe and friendly. They apply to all areas of ADISC, without exception.  
  
  
**1\. No Minors**  
  
You must be at least 18 years old to use ADISC.  
  
  
**2\. Be Honest**  
  
No lying about who you are, your age/DOB, or what happened to you.  
Don’t post a fictional story as if it really happened.  
  
  
**3\. No porn or explicit sexual material**  
  
This includes anything clearly intended to arouse.  
  
  
**4\. Be Polite**  
  
Respect others, even when you disagree with them.  
No bullying, insults, threats or personal attacks.  
No name-calling, or announcing that you have put someone on ignore.  
No aggressive backseat modding (ie: chasing new members away because you think they violated the rules).  
  
  
**5\. Be a Positive Influence**  
  
We want posts which are mature, interesting, insightful, funny, and/or supportive.  
We don't want posts that are spammy, immature, aggressive, condescending, solely about the condition of your diaper, and/or which drag the conversation off-topic.  
  
  
**6\. Respect The Law**, **Respect Yourself**  
  
No breaking the law.  
No encouraging anyone else to break the law.  
No asking how to, or encouraging anyone else to engage in, self-harm.  
Deliberately making yourself incontinent counts as self harm.  
  
  
**7\. No Personal Ads**  
  
No posts that read like personal ads on a dating site, especially "looking for mommy" type posts.  
In the Buddy Bench subforum, this rule is relaxed to allow people to look for friends, people to game with, etc, but "hookup" type posts are still not allowed.  
  
  
**8\. Use Readable English**  
  
We are an English-language site. All communication (including direct conversation messages!) must be in readable English.  
No txt speak, babytalk, or incomprehensible grammar.  
  
  
**9\. One Account Per Person**  
  
Do not register/use more than one ADISC account, unless it is necessary because you lost the password to your first account and cannot reset it using the "forgot password" feature.  
  
  
**10\. Crotch Shots and other image rules**  
  
Crotch shots are pictures that show exclusively, or primarily, someone’s "diaper area" front, back, or side. Don’t use a crotch shot as your forum avatar or profile picture. Putting them in your media uploads or forum posts are allowed, so long as they are not sexually-oriented and you are not posting an excessive quantity of them.  
No uploading pictures of anyone under 18, at the time the picture was taken. We allow occasional pictures of diaper/pullup packaging material that has a baby or other intended user of the product on it, but this is the only exception.  
No uploading ABDL pictures of anyone without their permission.  
No uploading any pictures of ADISC members without their permission.  
No uploading images (or anything else) which are, or look like, porn. Remember rule 3.  
  
  
**11\. Follow Staff Instructions**  
  
Staff members are labeled in **purple text**.  
Staff may review any content you submit/upload/etc on our service, without limitation.  
Staff may also submit it to third-party verification services (e.g: anti-spam filtering services) at our discretion.  
If a staff member tells you to stop doing something, then you must stop immediately. Do not argue.  
  
  
**12\. If disputing a moderation action, use the appropriate venue**  
  
The only acceptable way to dispute or discuss any warning, post deletion or other moderator action you have received is to post in the requests forum, or contact our admin privately.  
Mentioning it to other members, especially in a public place, is likely to lead to an additional warning/ban.  
  
  
**13\. Don't dox yourself, or anyone else**  
  
Don't post your full name, street address, phone number, email address, or any similar information that uniquely identifies you, in our public spaces.  
If you really have to give this info to another member, do so via the "conversation" option on their profile.  
If you can’t open a conversation yet (because you are not an EC yet) then you have to earn EC status first, then open it. You can't try to sidestep this rule by posting your email/phone/etc directly.  
This rule exists to protect you, by preventing ADISC from appearing in internet search results when someone searches your email, phone number, etc.  
Don't post anyone else's personal information, either.  
  
  
**14\. No Politics**  
  
Don't discuss politics in our community.  
What is considered political, and what isn't, is determined by our moderation staff.  
If you think something might be political, ask us before posting it.  
  
  
**15\. Be Responsible In Conversations**  
  
"Conversations" are messages that members (with the [Established Contributor (EC) rank or higher](https://www.adisc.org/forum/threads/leveling-up-on-adisc.131782/) can send to each other through our site.  
You have to have the rank of EC or higher on our site to initiate a conversation with any member except our staff. You can't try to work around this rule by posting your contact info publicly or otherwise trying to have members contact you off-site.  
Conversation messages are NOT exempt from any of our rules. This means that, for example, you still have to be polite and respectful to people in conversations, you can't send porn via conversations, etc.  
Any member who displays a habit of sending others unwelcome conversation messages may find that their EC status (and hence, their ability to start conversations) is revoked.  
As with the rest of ADISC, if you encounter a conversation message that breaks our rules, it is your duty to report it, using the 'report' button. Moderators may review conversation messages (whether reported, or not) to ensure they comply with our rules.  
If you wish to control who is allowed to start a conversation with you, use your [account privacy settings](https://www.adisc.org/forum/account/privacy) page to do that.  
  
  
**16\. Moo's Judgement**  
  
Moo may remove content and/or individuals as they see fit when they judge it to be in the best interests of ADISC to do so.  
For example, Moo may remove an individual who makes other members feel unsafe, even if they haven't clearly broken any other listed rule.  
Moo may also make case-by-case exceptions to listed rules, such as allowing a member to register and switch to using a second account for privacy reasons, even though second accounts are not normally allowed.  
Ultimately, ADISC is like a house party. You're a guest in Moo's virtual house, so please conduct yourself accordingly.  
  
  
  
**17\. Company Reps**  
  
Any individual who owns or works for any business which sells adult diapers or ABDL products is a company rep.  
Company reps must contact our admin via the [requests](https://www.adisc.org/forum/forums/requests.10/) forum, and be granted the special "Rep for _companyname_" title, before they start posting.  
Company reps may not market/advertise their products here, unless they either have approval from Moo to do so (request this at least a week in advance), or they are announcing the launch of an entirely original product of their own design.  
Company reps may not post on articles/threads about competitors' products, except to correct factually incorrect claims about the rep's own company, or their own company's product(s).  
Company reps may not use ADISC as a platform for resolving disputes with their customers.  
  
  
****18\. Be sensible about meetups****  
  
Real-life meetups may only be advertised/discussed in the EC+ forum.  
Any ABDL meetups advertised/discussed must be strictly 18+ only.  
Meetups should not be sexually-oriented. We're a support site, not a hookup site.  
We reserve the right to veto advertisement/discussion of a meetup if we feel it is unsafe or otherwise unsuitable.  
Anyone attending a meetup does so at their own risk.  
  
  
**19\. Other Legal Terms**  
  
Content submitted here expresses only the views of its author. We are not responsible for user-generated content and accounts.  
You are granting us a non-exclusive, permanent, irrevocable, unlimited license to use, publish, or re-publish your content in connection with the service.  
We may remove or modify any content submitted at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice.  
Requests for content to be removed or modified will be undertaken only at our discretion.  
We may terminate your access to all or any part of the service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice.  
This document is not an exhaustive list of terms. Other terms, such as our privacy policy, also apply.  
These terms may be changed at any time without notice.  
If you do not agree with these rules/terms, you may not use our service.
