COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE POLICY

**YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CONDUCT YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION (PERFORM DUE DILIGENCE) BEFORE BUYING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM ANYONE VIA THE INTERNET. THIS INCLUDES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD ON THIS WEBSITE AND ALL OTHER WEBSITES.**

MATERIAL CONNECTION

Unless otherwise expressly stated, you should assume that all references to products and services on www.GoGVO.com, are made because material connections exist between the website's owner ("Owner") and the providers of the mentioned products and services ("Provider").

GOOD FAITH RECOMMENDATIONS

The Owner recommends products and services on www.GoGVO.com based in part on a good faith belief that the purchase of such products or services will help purchasers in general. The Owner has this good faith belief because (a) the Owner has tried the product or service mentioned prior to recommending it or (b) the Owner has researched the reputation of the Provider and has made the decision to recommend the Provider's products or services based on the Provider's history of providing these or other products or services. The representations made by the Owner about products and services reflect the Owner's honest opinion based upon the facts known to the Owner at the time a product or service is mentioned on www.GoGVO.com.

POTENTIAL BIAS AND DUE DILIGENCE

The Owner's opinion about a product or service may be partially formed (consciously or subconsciously) in part based on the fact that the Owner has been compensated or will be compensated because of the Owner's business relationships with the Providers.

In some instances, the Owner and a Provider will have a business or personal relationship that does not involve the Owner receiving compensation related to products and services mentioned on www.GoGVO.com. However, the nature of the relationship is sufficient to establish a material connection between the Owner and the Provider.

Because there is a material connection between the Owner and Providers of products or services mentioned on www.GoGVO.com, you should always assume that the Owner may be biased because of the Owner's relationship with a Provider and/or because the Owner has received or will receive something of value from a Provider.

Perform your own due diligence before purchasing a product or service mentioned on www.GoGVO.com (or any other website).

COMPENSATION

The type of compensation received by the Owner may vary. In some instances, the Owner may receive complimentary products, services, or money from a Provider prior to mentioning the Provider's products or services on www.GoGVO.com.

In other instances, the Owner may receive a monetary commission or non-monetary compensation when you take action based on the content of www.GoGVO.com. This includes, but is not limited to, when you purchase a product or service from a Provider after clicking on an affiliate link on www.GoGVO.com.
