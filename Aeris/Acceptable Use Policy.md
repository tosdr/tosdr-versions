Acceptable Use Policy
=====================

This Acceptable Use Policy (the “Acceptable Use Policy”) applies to your use of any Aeris Services, as defined in the Aeris Services Terms of Use (the “Terms of Use”), the current version of which is available at [https://www.aeris.com/legal/](https://www.aeris.com/legal/). All capitalized terms in this Acceptable Use Policy not otherwise defined below have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.

**What is the purpose of the Acceptable Use Policy?**

This Acceptable Use Policy is put in place to ensure that users do not use the Aeris Services, the Web Portal or any other Aeris Site in illegal or prohibited ways. The examples described in this Acceptable Use Policy are intended to be illustrative only and are not exhaustive. We may modify this Acceptable Use Policy at any time in the same manner that the Terms of Use may be modified. By using the Aeris Services or accessing any Aeris Site, you agree to the latest version of this Acceptable Use Policy. If you violate the Acceptable Use Policy or authorize or help others to do so, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Aeris Services in addition to pursuing any other legal remedies.

**What uses are not allowed?**

* **No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content.** You may not use, or encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use the Aeris Services or any Aeris Site for any illegal, harmful or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, or offensive. Prohibited activities or content include:
    * **Illegal Activities.** Any illegal activities, including advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available services for gambling or disseminating, promoting or facilitating child pornography.
    * **Harmful or Fraudulent Activities.** . Activities that may be harmful to others, our operations or reputation, including offering or disseminating fraudulent goods, services, schemes or promotions, violating the privacy rights of any person, engaging in actions intended to cause physical or emotional harm, annoyance or inconvenience to us, our customers or any third parties, or engaging in other deceptive or harmful practices.
    * **Infringing Content.** Content that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others.
    * **Offensive Content.** Content that is defamatory, obscene, abusive, menacing, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable.
    * **Harmful Content.** Content or other computer technology that may damage, interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, program, or data, including viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, or cancelbots.

* **No Security Violations.** You may not use the Aeris Services to violate the security or integrity of any network, computer or communications system, software application, or network or computing device operated by Aeris, its customers or third parties (each, a “System”). Prohibited activities include:
    * **Unauthorized Access.** Accessing or using any System without permission, including attempting to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of a System or to breach any security or authentication measures used by a System.
    * **Interception.** Monitoring of data or traffic on a System without permission.
    * **Falsification of Origin.** Forging TCP-IP packet headers, e-mail headers, or any part of a message describing its origin or route. This prohibition does not include the use of aliases or anonymous remailers.

* **No Network Abuse.** You may not make network connections to any users, hosts, or networks unless you have permission to communicate with them. Prohibited activities include:
    * **Monitoring or Crawling.** Monitoring or crawling of a System that impairs or disrupts the System being monitored or crawled.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS).** Intentionally inundating a target with communications requests so the target either cannot respond to legitimate traffic or responds so slowly that it becomes ineffective.
    * **Intentional Interference.** Intentionally interfering with the proper functioning of any System, including any deliberate attempt to overload a system by mail bombing, news bombing, broadcast attacks, or flooding techniques.
    * **Operation of Certain Network Services.** Operating network services like open proxies, open mail relays, or open recursive domain name servers.
    * **Avoiding System Restrictions.** Using manual or electronic means to avoid any use limitations placed on a System, such as access and storage restrictions.

* **No E-Mail or Other Message Abuse.** You may not use the Aeris Services directly or indirectly to distribute, publish, send, or facilitate the sending of unsolicited mass e-mail, SMS or other messages, promotions, advertising, or solicitations, including commercial advertising and informational announcements. You will not alter or obscure mail or message headers or assume a sender’s identity without the sender’s explicit permission. You will not collect replies to messages sent from another internet service provider if those messages violate this Acceptable Use Policy or the acceptable use policy of that provider.

**Our Monitoring and Enforcement**

We reserve the right, but do not assume the obligation, to investigate any violation of this Acceptable Use Policy or misuse of the Aeris Services or any Aeris Site. We may:

* with or without notice to you, remove, disable access to, or modify any content or resource that violates this Acceptable Use Policy or any other agreement we have with you for use of the Aeris Services or any Aeris Site;
* take any lawful steps to enforce this Acceptable Use Policy or any other agreement we have with you for use of the Aeris Services or any Aeris Site;

* cooperate with appropriate law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other appropriate third parties to help with the investigation and prosecution of illegal conduct by providing network and systems information related to alleged violations of this Acceptable Use Policy.

**Reporting Violations of this Acceptable Use Policy**

If you become aware of any violation of this Acceptable Use Policy by any person, please notify us immediately and provide us with assistance, as we may reasonably request, to stop or remedy the violation.
