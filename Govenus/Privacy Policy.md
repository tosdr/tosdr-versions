PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. PLEASE NOTE IN PARTICULAR THE PARTS THAT ARE IN BOLD WRITING AS THESE PARTS MIGHT LIMIT OUR RISK OR LIABILITY, REQUIRE YOU TO INDEMNIFY US OR TO ASSUME RISK AND LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN ISSUES, OR TO ACKNOWLEDGE CERTAIN FACTS.

1\. Scope of the Privacy Policy

1.1 Introduction and scope

1.2 Heavenly Concepts Pty Ltd ("GoVenus" or "we" or "us" or "our") offers an online relationship service, using primarily the ancient art of astrology to help you find a suitable matching potential partner (the "Service"). The Service allows you to find information on an individual's astrological profile, based on their date, time (where provided) and place of birth. It also allows you to register to receive matching members' details, and for you to share your astrological profile with matching members. You can then see more information about that member as well as have a basic chat or block that member.

1.2.1 This GoVenus Website Privacy Policy (this "Privacy Policy"), which must be read together with our Website Terms and Conditions at https://www.govenus.co/tandc.html ("Terms"), sets out what we will do with any Personal Information (defined in paragraph 2.1 below) we collect from or about you, or that you provide to us, when you use the Website. Unless defined elsewhere, terms in this Privacy Policy shall bear the same meaning ascribed to them in the Terms.

1.2.2 Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your Personal Information and how we will treat it.

1.2.3 GoVenus is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. We strive to ensure that our use of your Personal Information is lawful, reasonable, and relevant to our business activities, with the ultimate goal of improving our Services and your experience.

1.3.1 By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you provide us with your express consent and agreement that we may collect, get, receive, record, organise, collate, store, update, change, retrieve, read, process, use and share your Personal Information in the ways set out in this Privacy Policy. When we do one or more of these actions with your Personal Information, we are "Processing" your Personal Information.

1.3.2 If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, or are concerned about any aspect as it relates to your Personal Information, please do not continue to use the Website and the Services.

1.4 Who does this Privacy Policy apply to?

1.4.1 This Privacy Policy applies to-

1.4.1.1 us, and our successors-in-title; and

1.4.1.2 you, namely a person who:

1.4.1.2.1 browses, uses, accesses, refers to, views and/or downloads the information made available by us on the Website ("Content") for whatever purpose; and/or

1.4.1.2.2 registers as a user on the Website by creating a user Account,

regardless of the device which you use to access it, which device is capable of using or enabled to use the Website, including but not limited to internet-connected computer, mobile devices and tablets ("Access Device"), ("user", "you", or "your").

1.4.2 This Privacy Policy does not apply to other parties' websites, products or services, such as websites linked to, from or advertised on the Website, or websites which link to or advertise the Website.

2\. What is Personal Information?

2.1 "Personal Information" refers to private information about an identifiable person, which includes your name and surname, age, date, time and place of birth, contact details (e.g. your home address, postal address, e-mail address or phone number), physical location, social media account details and profile pictures.

3\. How do we receive your Personal Information?

3.1 We may receive your Personal Information in several ways, including, when (i) you access, browse or make use of Website and/or the Content on the Website; (ii) you create / register a user account on the Website to access or make use of the Services; (iii) you contact us, by email or telephonically, with any queries; (iv) we carry out demographic research; and/or (v) you submit your Personal Information to us for any other reason, or authorise third parties to do so.

3.2 We passively receive some of your Personal Information from the Access Device that you use to access and navigate through the Website, using various technological means, including relying on server logs to collect and maintain log file information.

3.3 We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers which enable our computer system to recognise you as a unique user when you visit the Website. A cookie is a small text file (including an alphanumeric identifier) which our computer system transfers to your Access Device through your web browser when you visit the Website and which is stored via your web browser. When you visit the Website again, the cookie allows the site to recognise your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information.

You may disable the use of cookies by configuring your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do so, you may not be able to enjoy all of the features and functionality of the Website.

3.4 Some of the information we receive is Personal Information, and some is non-personal information that becomes personal if it is connected to your account information. In some circumstances we will de-identify, anonymise or segregate information so that we may make use of it in aggregate form without treating it as Personal Information.

4\. What information do we receive?

If you do not wish to provide Basic Account Information to us, then you will not be able to register a user account or to use the Services on the Website.

4.1.1.1 Volunteering any other information beyond Basic Account Information is optional. Most of GoVenus' features also require additional information to function, as described below. If you do not agree to share other information with us, then you may not be able to enjoy all of the features and functionality on the Website.
