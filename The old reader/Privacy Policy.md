Due to continued changes with Facebook login and concerns about privacy with Facebook, we've decided to stop supporting Facebook login. It's easy to transition your account by using the [Forgot password?](https://theoldreader.com/users/password/new) link and entering the email address associated with your Facebook account. Then you can set a password and login directly to The Old Reader. Thanks for your understanding and thanks for continuing to use The Old Reader.
