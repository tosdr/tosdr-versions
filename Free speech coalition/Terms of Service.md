----------------

For any dispute you have with the Company, you will first contact the Company and attempt to resolve the dispute informally.

Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.

Nothing in this section 15.5 will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the service.  

**15.6. Class Action Waiver**   
All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless the Company agrees otherwise, the arbitrator will not consolidate more than one person’s claims.

**15.7. Jury Trial Waiver**  
Each party hereby waives its right to a trial by jury in any proceedings arising out of, or relating to the subject matter of, this agreement. Either party may enforce this waiver up to and including the first day of trial.

**15.8. Limited Time to Bring Claims**  
A party will not bring a claim arising out of, or related to the subject matter of, this agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Any claim brought after one year is barred.

16\. General
------------

**16.1. Entire Agreement**  
This agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this agreement. It supersedes all earlier written or oral discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings, and agreements between the parties concerning the transactions contemplated in this agreement.

**16.2. Assignment and Delegation**   
You will not assign any of your rights or delegate any performance under this agreement, except with the Company’s written consent. The Company may assign its rights or delegate its performances under this agreement without your consent. Any purported assignment of rights or delegation of performance in breach of this section 16.2 is void.

**16.3. Waivers**   
The parties may waive any provision in this agreement only by a writing signed by the party or parties against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. No failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy, or in requiring the satisfaction of any condition, under this agreement, and no act, omission, or course of dealing between the parties, operates as a waiver or estoppel of any right, remedy, or condition. A waiver made in writing on one occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver on any future occasion or against any other person.

**16.4. Severability**   
The parties intend as follows:

(a) that if any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, then that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, unless that modification is not permitted by law, in which case that provision will be disregarded;

(b) that if modifying or disregarding the unenforceable provision would result in failure of an essential purpose of this agreement, the entire agreement will be held unenforceable;

(c) that if an unenforceable provision is modified or disregarded in accordance with this section 16.4, then the rest of the agreement will remain in effect as written; and

(d) that any unenforceable provision will remain as written in any circumstances other than those in which the provision is held to be unenforceable.

**16.5. Governing Law**   
California law, without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles, governs all matters arising out of, or relating to the subject matter of, this agreement, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.

**16.6. Force Majeure**

(a) If a force majeure event prevents a party from complying with any one or more obligations under this agreement, that inability will not constitute a breach if (1) that party uses reasonable efforts to perform those obligations, (2) that party’s inability to perform those obligations is not due to its failure to (A) take reasonable measures to protect itself against events or circumstances of the same type as that force majeure event or (B) develop and keep a reasonable contingency plan to respond to events or circumstances of the same type as that force majeure event, and (3) that party complies with its obligations under section 16.6(c).

(b) For purposes of this agreement, “force majeure event” means, for any party, any event or circumstance, whether or not foreseeable, that was not caused by that party (other than a strike or other labor unrest that affects only that party, an increase in prices or other change in general economic conditions, a change in law, or an event or circumstances that results in that party’s not having sufficient funds to comply with an obligation to pay money) and any consequences of that event or circumstance.

(c) If a force majeure event occurs, the noncomplying party will promptly notify the other party of occurrence of that force majeure event, its effect on performance, and how long the noncomplying party expects it to last. From then on, the noncomplying party will update that information as reasonably necessary. During a force majeure event, the noncomplying party will use reasonable efforts to limit damages to the other party and to resume its performance under this agreement.

**16.7. No Third-Party Beneficiaries**  
This agreement does not, and the parties do not intend it to, confer any rights or remedies on any person other than the parties to this agreement.

**16.8. Relationship of the Parties**  
The parties intend that their relationship will be that of independent contractors and not business partners. This agreement does not, and the parties do not intend it to, create a partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, or employment relationship between the parties and the parties expressly disclaim the existence of any of these relationships between them. Neither of the parties is the agent for the other, and neither party has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a third party.

**16.9. Successors and Assigns**  
This agreement binds and inures to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This section 16.9 does not address, directly or indirectly, whether a party may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this agreement. Section 16.2 addresses these matters.

**16.10. Permission to Send Emails to You**  
You grant the Company permission to email notices, advertisements, and other communications to you, including emails, advertisements, notices, and other communications containing adult oriented material, sexual content and language, and images of nudity unsuitable for minors. Your permission will continue until you ask the Company to remove you from its email list.

**16.11. Electronic Communications Not Private**  
The Company does not provide facilities for sending or receiving confidential electronic communications. You should consider all messages sent to the Company or from the Company as open communications readily accessible to the public. You should not use the Site to send or receive messages you only intend the sender and named recipients to read. Users or operators of the Site may read all messages you send to the Site regardless of whether they are intended recipients.

**16.12. Electronic Signatures**  
Any affirmation, assent, or agreement you send through the Site will bind you. You acknowledge that when you click on an “I agree,” “I consent,” or other similarly worded “button” or entry field with your mouse, keystroke, or other computer device, your agreement or consent will be legally binding and enforceable and the legal equivalent of your handwritten signature.

**16.13. Feedback**  
The Company encourages you to give feedback about the Company or the Site. But the Company will not treat as confidential any suggestion or idea provided by you, and nothing in this agreement will restrict the Company’s right to use, profit from, disclose, publish, or otherwise exploit any feedback, without paying you.

**16.14. Contact Information**  
If you have questions about this agreement, the Site, your membership, or the Free Speech Coalition, you may contact the Company by email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), by phone at (818) 348-9373, or by mail at P.O.
