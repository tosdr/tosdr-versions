Student Data Privacy Policy
===========================

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

This Privacy Policy describes WIRIS’s privacy practices in relation to information that we collect through the website [www.wiris.com](https://www.wiris.com/) operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “Website”) and through the WIRIS Products made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices that link to this Privacy Policy.

To summarize our data privacy commitment: 

* We do not display advertising on our tools or on our website
* We do not sell or share your data with third parties to advertise or market to you. 
* We do not host third-party cookies or trackers that would allow those third parties to track you on our site.
* We use the data you share with WIRIS solely to provide you the WIRIS service, to improve it, and to keep you updated about new developments. And we only use third party services that have made the same commitment to us. 
* If you ever want to be forgotten, simply email us at [privacy@wiris.com](mailto:privacy@wiris.com) and all your data will be completely removed from our system.

* * *

### COPPA

This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and outlines our practices world-wide regarding the personal information of all students under 13. For more information about COPPA and general tips about protecting children’s online privacy, please visit [OnGuard Online](http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online).

The policies outlined in this COPPA Privacy Policy are intended to supplement the information appearing in our general Privacy Policy. Where the COPPA Privacy Policy conflicts with our general Privacy Policy concerning information about a Child, the terms of this COPPA Privacy Policy will prevail over our general Privacy Policy.

* * *

### Teachers or schools consent in lieu of a parent

With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Schools should always notify parents about these activities.

WIRIS collects limited personal information from students where that student’s school, district, or teacher has provided access to the WIRIS service, which collects personal information solely for the use and benefit of the learning environment.  

If you are accessing WIRIS Tools on behalf of a Class, School or District, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirement to secure parental consent for accessing applications which require personal information from children under 13.

* * *

### Review and Deletion of Personal Information

Under FERPA regulations, Parents have the right to refuse the site further contact with their child and to have access to their child’s school record information and to have it deleted by contacting the school administrator.

If you are a parent and would like more information on parental rights with respect to a child’s educational record under the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), please visit the [FERPA site](http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html). 

If you are the parent and guardian of a student using WIRIS Software, and cease to agree with WIRIS’s terms of use and privacy policy at some point in the future, you may opt-out by contacting the WIRIS subscriber (typically your school) contact us directly at [privacy@wiris.com](mailto:privacy@wiris.com).

If you wish to review your or your student’s or your child’s personally identifiable information stored by WIRIS, you may email us your request at [privacy@wiris.com](mailto:privacy@wiris.com) . We will respond to your request within 30 days.

If your or your student’s or your child’s personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or delete it, email us at [privacy@wiris.com](mailto:privacy@wiris.com). We will respond to your request within 30 days.

We will retain your information only for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at [support@wiris.com](mailto:support@wiris.com). We will only retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations.

In any correspondence such as e-mail or mail, please include the children email, the school or organization, and the teacher or parent’s email address and telephone number. To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify a teacher or parent’s identity before granting access to any personal information.
