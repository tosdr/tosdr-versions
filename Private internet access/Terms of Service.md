#### Dispute Resolution, Arbitration & Class Action Waiver

This part of the Agreement outlines how disputes between you and PIA will be resolved through our informal dispute resolution process, individual arbitration, or small claims court. An “arbitration” is a less formal alternative to a lawsuit or jury trial in court. A neutral third party, called an arbitrator, decides the dispute. The arbitrator applies the same law and can award the same individualized remedies that a court could award, but uses streamlined procedures and limits discovery to simplify the process and reduce costs. The arbitrator’s decision is legally binding, and it is subject to very limited review by courts. **You and PIA agree that arbitration will take place on an individual basis. Class arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are not permitted. This means that you and PIA will neither file a lawsuit (in any court other than a small claims court), nor pursue or participate in an action seeking relief on behalf of others**.

Purpose. The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and PIA regarding the Services or the use of the Services, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration agreement and class action waiver. "Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If you or PIA have a Dispute that cannot be resolved through negotiation within the time frame described in the "Notice of Dispute" clause below, you and PIA agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through arbitration of that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section, and not litigate any Dispute in court, except for those matters listed in the Exclusions from Arbitration clause. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury. This arbitration provision will survive the termination of the agreement.

Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND PIA AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY PIA IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.

RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY PIA IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. If you or PIA elects to resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/), or JAMS [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.org/). The terms of this Section govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties.

Arbitration Procedures. Because this agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes ("Supplementary Procedures") shall apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with PIA as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you may be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to PIA. In any case, the arbitrator shall have the authority only to the individual parties to the arbitration and only to the extent of their individual claims. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

Location of Arbitration. You or PIA may initiate arbitration in either Los Angeles County, California or the United States county in which you reside. In the event that you select the county of your United States residence, PIA may transfer the arbitration to Los Angeles County in the event that PIA agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location as determined by the arbitrator.

The Terms and Conditions contained herein and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by PIA without restriction.
