**COOKIES & OPT OUT OF INTEREST-BASED ADS**

We and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Services, gather demographic information about our user base, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Services and other websites or apps, and better understand your online activity. We may receive reports from our partners based on the use of these technologies on an individual basis (that is, reports of your own activity) as well as on an aggregated basis (that is, reports of all user activity or of the activity of certain users as a group).

We may use local storage on your device, such as with HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

**Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads:** Some of the parties that collect information from or about you on the Services in order to provide more relevant advertising to you may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising. To learn more about the DAA and your opt-out options for their members for websites, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Please note that if you opt-out of online behavioral advertising using any of these methods, the opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. This does not opt you out of being served all advertising, and you will continue to receive ads that are not tailored to your interests.

The Services may include social media features, such as a “Like” button. These features may collect your IP address and information about the page you are visiting in the Services. They may also set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly in the Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS**

If you are using the Services from outside the United States, including in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we will need to transfer your Personal Information to the United States.

To find out more about how we safeguard your Personal Information when it is transferred across borders, please contact us using the details provided in the “How to Contact Us” section below.

**U.S. PRIVACY RIGHTS AND REQUESTS**

**Explanation** **of Applicable Privacy Rights**

Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may have certain rights in relation to your Personal Information, including:

* **Right to Know****:** You may have the right to request that we provide you with what Personal Information we have collected about you, including the categories of Personal Information, the categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing Personal Information, the categories of third parties to whom we disclose Personal Information, and the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you. Please note that we may not be required to respond to your requests “to know” or access specific pieces of Personal Information more than twice in any 12-month period.
* **Right to Data Portability:** You may have the right to access your information in a portable format.
* **Right to Delete:** You may have the right to request that we delete Personal Information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Note that there are some reasons we will not be able to fully address your request, such as if we need to complete a transaction for you, to detect and protect against fraudulent and illegal activity, to exercise our rights, for our internal purposes, or to comply with a legal obligation.
* **Right to Correct:** You may have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we may maintain about you, subject to appropriate verification.

·       **Right to Opt-Out of Certain Types of Personal Information Uses and Disclosures:** We use and disclose to third parties’ Personal Information for analytics and advertising purposes. Accordingly, you may have the right to opt out of the “sale” or "sharing” of your Personal Information, or the use and disclosure of your Personal Information for “targeted advertising” (as these terms are defined in applicable law).

**How to Submit a Request**

Please note that, where permitted under applicable law, we may decline a request if we are unable to verify your identity (or an agent’s authority to make the request) and confirm the Personal Information we maintain relates to you.

If you are interested in exercising one or more of the rights outlined above, please follow the prompts [here](https://www.nestlehealthscience.us/data-request?brand=nb) or contact us using the “How to Contact Us” section below. If by email, please indicate the type of request you are making in the subject line of your message. We may take steps to verify your identity before responding to your request by asking you a series of questions about your previous interactions with us. Submitting a privacy rights request does not require you to create an account with us.

To take advantage of your right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information or to opt-out of targeted advertising, please click the “ Your Privacy Choices” link found on our Site footer and follow the instructions in the pop-up window or contact us using the “How to Contact Us” section below. Submitting an opt-out request does not require you to create an account with us.

Alternatively, you may choose to enable online, where available, a universal opt-out preference via a tool that automatically communicates your opt-out preferences, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”). If you enable a browser-based opt-out preference signal, such as GPC, upon receipt or detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information linked to that browser and any consumer profile we have associated with that browser. Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each browser or profile.

We will not discriminate against you because you exercised your rights under this section of the Privacy Policy.

**Agent Requests**

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may submit a request related to your Personal Information. You may also submit a request on behalf of your minor child.

Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may authorize someone to make a privacy rights request on your behalf (an authorized agent). Authorized agents will need to demonstrate that you’ve authorized them to act on your behalf or must demonstrate they have power of attorney pursuant to applicable probate law. We retain the right to request confirmation directly from you confirming that the agent is authorized to make such a request, or to request additional information to confirm the agent’s identity. An authorized agent is prohibited from using a consumer’s Personal Information, or any information collected from or about the consumer, for any purpose other than to fulfill the consumer’s requests, for verification, or for fraud prevention. If you are making a request as an authorized agent, please contact us using the information in the “How to Contact Us” section below, and provide your full name, address, email address, the full name of the person on whose behalf you are making the request, their address, email, phone number, as well as the written permission of the person on whose behalf you are acting to do so.

**Right to Appeal**

Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may have the right to appeal a decision we have made in connection with your privacy rights request. You may appeal our decision by emailing us at [NHScLegal@us.nestle.com](mailto:NHSLegal@us.nestle.com). If you have concerns about the results of an appeal, you may contact the attorney general in the state where you reside.

**U.S. Data Protection Disclosures**

In the past twelve (12) months, we have collected the categories of information disclosed above in the “Notice at Collection” section and disclosed those categories for the business purposes also listed in the “Notice at Collection” section.

With the exception of Characteristics of Protected Classifications under California or Federal Law and Sensitive Personal Information, each category of Personal Information disclosed in the “Notice at Collection” section was sold or shared with analytics and advertising partners, business partners, advertising networks, advertising platforms, and social media companies and the other entities identified in the “To Whom We Disclose Personal Information” section above, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy within the last twelve (12) months, including for marketing purposes. We do not knowingly sell or share Personal Information about persons under the age of sixteen (16). 

**Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information:** To the extent that we collect, use, or share “Sensitive Personal Information” as that term is defined in applicable law, we limit our use or disclosure of the Sensitive Personal Information to permitted business purposes.

**U.S. NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE**

We offer a voluntary rewards program ([Ageless Health Rewards](https://www.agelesshealthrewards.com/)) that provides certain perks, such as member-exclusive coupons, sweepstakes, healthy aging resources, and other exclusive offers. We may also provide other programs, such as subscribe & save, refer-a-friend, contests, or other similar promotional campaigns (collectively, “Programs”).

When you sign up for one of these Programs, we typically ask you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address and/or telephone number). We use this information for the purposes described above under the section titled “How We Use the Personal Information We Collect,” including targeted advertising. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in the “To Whom We Disclose Personal Information” section, including data analytics providers, advertising technology vendors, and social media platforms. Because our Programs involve the collection of Personal Information, they might be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under California law or “bona fide loyalty programs” under Colorado law. If you ask us to delete your Personal Information, we will not be able to provide you with access to these Programs.

The value of your Personal Information that we collect is reasonably related to the value of the free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the applicable Program, less the expense related to offering those products, services, and benefits to Program participants.

You can opt-in to a Program by following the sign-up or participation instructions provided, and, for any ongoing benefits, you have the ability to withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by following the instructions set forth in the applicable Program terms or contacting us at [info@naturesbounty.com](mailto:info@naturesbounty.com).
