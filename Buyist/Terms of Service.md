In addition to these Terms of Service, you also agree to be bound by the additional terms applicable to Third Party Services. Any use by you of Third Party Services is at your own risk and discretion, and it is your responsibility to read the terms, policies, instructions and other documentation applicable to such Third Party Services before using them. You acknowledge and agree that Buyist cannot control, provides no warranties or representations with respect to, and will not be held responsible for, Third Party Services.

6\. **THIRD PARTY INTEGRATION**. In delivering the Services to you, Buyist may in its sole discretion take steps to configure the Services for, and/or integrate the Services with, Third Party Services (“**Integration**”). All Integration will be based on and governed by the documentation, technical literature and other information provided by the provider of the Third Party Service in question (“**Third Party Documentation**”). Although Buyist will use best efforts to achieve Integration based on Third Party Documentation, Buyist makes no representations or warranties regarding, and shall not be responsible for: (a) the operability, functionality, availability, or suitability of any Integration, Third Party Service, or transfer of data via any such Integration or Third Party Service; (b) the integrity or accuracy of data transmitted, transferred, stored, obtained or received via any Integration or Third Party Service; or (c) any error(s) made by Buyist or any other party as part of any Integration. Buyist is not obligated to: (1) monitor, maintain or support any Integration or Third Party Service; or (2) provide you with updates, fixes, or services related thereto. In the event that a provider of a Third Party Service requests payment or other compensation to accomplish Integration, Buyist shall not be responsible for any such payment or compensation.

In delivering the Services to you, Buyist may in its sole discretion offer Integration with one or more Third Party Services that will facilitate payments for products or services sold on or via your Online Store (as that term is defined below) (each, a “**Third Party Payment Processor**”). All such Integrations are subject to the terms of the preceding Sections 5 and 6 of these Terms of Service, but any payment processed by a Third Party Payment Processor is controlled by and subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of that Third Party Payment Processor, and is not controlled by Buyist.

11\. **USER ACCOUNT AND DATA**.  
  
a. **User Account**. To access and use the Services, you must sign up for an account with Buyist (“**User Account**”). Only the person who signs up for the User Account will be the contracting party for purposes of these Terms of Service, and will be authorized to use the User Account in connection with the Services (the “**Owner**”). If the person who signs up for the User Account is doing so on behalf of that person’s employer, that person must have the authority to bind its employer to these Terms of Service, and the employer will be the Owner. The Owner is permitted to allow others in its control to access and use the Services in connection with the Owner’s User Account, but in doing so acknowledges and agrees that it: (a) is responsible for ensuring that its employees and other agents comply with these Terms of Service; and (b) is liable for any breach of these Terms of Service by the Owner’s employees and other agents.

When you sign up for a User Account, you are required to provide Buyist with true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself in all required fields of the Buyist registration form. If your information changes, you agree to update your account to reflect these changes. If Buyist determines in its sole discretion that your account information is not complete, current, or accurate, or that your account violates the Terms of Service, Buyist may in its sole discretion suspend or terminate your account.  
  
c. **User Email Address**. In signing for a User Account, you will be required to provide an email address (“**User Email**”). Buyist will use that User Email as the primary means of communicating with you. You agree to monitor the User Email, and use the User Email to communicate with Buyist.  
  
d. **Online Stores**. You may use the Services to create an online store to sell products and services to your customers (an “**Online Store**”). Each Online Store can be associated with only one User Account, but each User Account may have more than one Online Stores.  
  
e. **User Data**. Buyist does not own any data, information, or material that you upload or otherwise transmit to the Services (“**User Data**”). You, not Buyist, are fully responsible for the quality, integrity, legality, accuracy, intellectual property ownership, reliability, appropriateness, or the right to use all of the User Data. You acknowledge and agree that Buyist will not be held responsible for the deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any User Data. Subject to the Buyist Privacy Policy, any User Data you upload or otherwise transmit to the Services or to Buyist, whether by email or other means, for any reason, will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary. While you retain all rights to the User Data, you grant Buyist a non-exclusive, transferrable, sublicensable, royalty-free, perpetual, and worldwide right to host, use, copy, distribute, expose, run, store, publicly perform, communicate to the public, broadcast, reproduce, make available, display, publish, translate, adapt, modify, create derivative works of, and otherwise use the User Data for any purpose whatsoever, regardless of the form or medium in which it is used. Buyist may use our rights under this license to operate, provide, and promote the Services and to perform our obligations and exercise our rights under the Terms of Service. You represent, warrant, and agree that you have all necessary rights in the User Data to grant this license. You irrevocably waive any and all moral rights you may have in the User Data in favor of Buyist and agree that this waiver may be invoked by anyone who obtains rights in the User Data through Buyist, including anyone to whom Buyist may transfer or grant (including by way of license or sublicense) any rights in the User Data. You acknowledge and agree that Buyist can, at any time, review and delete any or all of the User Data submitted or uploaded to the Services, although Buyist is not obligated to do so.  
  
12\. **DMCA**. Buyist respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we ask you to do the same. If Buyist is notified of alleged infringing User Data through Buyist’s Designated Agent, a decision may be made to remove access or disable access to such User Data, in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) (“**DMCA**”). Buyist may also make a good faith attempt to contact the person who submitted the affected material so that they may make a counter-notification.  
  
If you believe that your or someone else’s copyright has been infringed by User Data or other materials provided on the Services, you (or the owner or rights holder, collectively, “**Rights Holder**”) should send notification to Buyist’s Designated Agent immediately. Prior to sending us notice, the Rights Holder may wish to consult a lawyer to determine its rights and legal obligations under the DMCA and any other applicable laws. Nothing in the Terms of Service, the Site, or anywhere else in the Services is intended as a substitute for qualified legal advice. To file a notice of infringing material, Buyist asks that the Rights Holder provide the following information: (a) reasonably sufficient details about the nature of the copyrighted work in question, or, in the case of multiple alleged infringements, a representative list of such works (this should include, title(s), author(s), any U.S. Copyright Registration number(s), URL(s), etc.); (b) reasonably sufficient details to enable Buyist to identify and locate the material that is allegedly infringing the Rights Holders’ work(s) (for example, file name or URL of the page(s) that contain(s) the material); (c) the Rights Holder’s contact information so that Buyist can contact them (including for example, the Rights Holder’s address, telephone number, and email address); (d) a statement that the Rights Holder has a good faith belief that the use of the identified material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (e) a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that the Rights Holder is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; and (f) the Rights Holder’s electronic signature.

13\. **PAYMENTS AND FEES**.  
  
You will pay all fees applicable to your subscription for the Services (collectively, the “**Fees**”). Buyist calculates and bills Fees in advance on a monthly basis, unless you and Buyist agree otherwise in writing. You agree that you will pay all applicable Fees according to the billing process described below. Payment for Fees may be made via wire transfer, automated clearing house (“ACH”) transfer, check, credit card, or other payment method agreed to by you and Buyist in writing.  
  
a. **Fee Cycle and Payment of Fees**. You agree to allow Buyist to charge you on a monthly basis in advance for all Fees associated with providing the Services. You also agree to allow Buyist to charge you, as needed, for additional overage costs or other charges that you may accumulate in connection with your use of the Services. If you accumulate additional Fees or other charges in connection with the Services, Buyist will charge you in the payment period directly following the month in which the additional charges were accumulated. All charges and Fees paid are non-refundable unless we specifically state otherwise in these Terms of Service, in a writing signed by you and Buyist, or as otherwise provided by applicable law.  
  
b. **Payment by Credit Card**. If you choose to pay Fees by credit card, you agree: (a) to keep a valid credit card on file with Buyist to pay for incurred and reoccurring Fees (“**Authorized Credit Card**”); (b) Buyist will charge all applicable Fees to your Authorized Credit Card; and (c) Buyist will continue to charge the Authorized Credit Card for applicable Fees until the Services are terminated, and all outstanding Fees have been paid in full.  
  
c. **Rejected Charges**. If Buyist is not able to process payment of Fees using an Authorized Credit Card or other means of payment provided by you (“**Rejected Charge**”), Buyist will notify you by email sent to the User Email (“**Email Notification**”). If payment of the outstanding Fees associated with the Rejected Charge is not made: (a) within seven (7) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall disable all access to your User Account except the designated account admin; (b) within ten (10) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall disable all fulfillment exports associated with the User Account, and all orders in queue for the User Account can be exported only after the outstanding Fees associated with the Rejected Charge are paid; (c) within fourteen (14) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall disable your Online Store(s); (d) within twenty-one (21) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall disable your User Account; and (e) within thirty (30) days of sending the Email Notification, Buyist shall permanently delete your User Account and all User Data.  
  
d. **Billing Policies**. All Payments to Buyist are nonrefundable. Buyist does not give pro-rated refunds for unused time if you cancel your account in the middle of a billing cycle. Additionally, Buyist does not grant upgrade/downgrade refunds, nor does it grant refunds for months that are unused by an open account.  
  
e. **Upgrades**. You agree to pay for any upgrades to the Services that you request for your user accounts. For any such upgrade, Buyist will automatically charge you with the new rate on your next billing cycle. If you upgrade in the middle of a billing cycle, a prorated amount for the upgrade may be assessed immediately.  
  
f. **Downgrades**. If you decide to downgrade the Services, you may lose significant features, functionality, or storage capacity on your account. In the event that this occurs, Buyist does not accept any liability for any such loss. You are solely responsible for planning ahead and backing up your data before your account downgrade occurs. You agree and acknowledge that Buyist is not liable for your User Data, and that it has no obligation to retain your User Data, in the event of a downgrade. You also acknowledge and agree that Buyist may, in its sole discretion, permanently delete any User Data affected by a downgrade.  
  
g. **Additional Fees and Taxes**. Buyist is not responsible for any additional bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed to you by Buyist. Currency exchange settlements will be based on agreements between you and your credit card or other payment provider. You, and not Buyist, are responsible for paying all sales tax, use tax, value added taxes, withholding taxes and any other similar taxes and charge of any kind imposed by any federal, state or local governmental entity for any transactions with Buyist. If Buyist has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which you are responsible, the appropriate amount will be invoiced and paid by you unless you provide Buyist with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate tax authority.  
  
h. **Fee Changes**. Buyist reserves the right to change the prices of the Services and other Fees, including without limitation monthly subscription plan fees upon the renewal of your subscription contract. No Fee or other price changes will take place during a subscription contract. Fee and other price changes take effect upon renewal of the subscription contract. Renewals of subscription contracts will take place automatically if you continue to use the Services beyond your current or initial contract term.  
  
i. **Late Payment, Non Payment, and Suspension**. All payments must be made in advance of receiving the Services. Unless otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, if Buyist does not receive payment of Fees as and when due, Buyist retains the right, without notice, to suspend or terminate the Services.  
  
14\. **TERM AND TERMINATION**.  
  
a. **Term**. The term of these Terms of Service begins when you first access, register for, or use the Services, and continues until terminated by you or Buyist, as provided in these Terms of Service (the “**Term**”).  
  
b. **Termination by Buyist**. Buyist may, in its sole discretion and without notice, terminate your account or use of the Services, and/or delete your User Data, for any reason and at any time. Any such termination of these Terms of Service by Buyist is without prejudice to any rights or obligations which arose prior to the date of termination by Buyist.  
  
c. **Termination by You**. You may, at any time and for any reason, terminate your account with Buyist or your use of the Services. You acknowledge and agree that Buyist does not give pro-rated refunds for unused time if you request to terminate your account in the middle of a billing cycle.  
  
d. **Rights Upon Termination**. Upon termination of your account or the Services by you or Buyist: (a) your right to use Services will stop immediately; (b) you will no longer be able to access your account; (c) you will not be entitled to any refunds of any Fees; (d) all outstanding balances owed to Buyist for use of the Services through the date of termination will become immediately due and payable in full; and (e) your Online Store(s) will be taken offline.

Once your account is terminated, you will not have any access to any User Data that you stored on the Services. For avoidance of doubt, you acknowledge and agree that Buyist does not give pro-rated refunds for unused time if Buyist suspends or terminates your account in the middle of a billing cycle.  
  
15\. **YOUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**.

You agree that you are responsible for the conduct of all users of your account and any User Data that is created, transmitted, stored, or displayed by, from, or within your account while using the Services. You will be held responsible for any consequences, legal or otherwise, that arise from your use of Services.
