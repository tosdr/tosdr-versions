Copyright Infringement.
-----------------------

As Qualified asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others.

Qualified will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material.

In the case of such termination, Qualified will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Qualified.

To expedite Qualified’s handling of your notice, please use the following format or refer to Section 512(c)(3) of the Copyright Act.

2. Identify the material that you allege is infringing upon the copyrighted work listed in Item #1 above. Include the name of the concerned litigious material (all images or posts if relevant) with its complete reference.
3. Provide information on which Qualified may contact you, including your email address, name, telephone number and physical address.‍
4. Provide the address, if available, to allow Qualified to notify the owner/ administrator of the allegedly infringing webpage or other content, including email address.‍
5. Also include a statement of the following: “I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.”‍
6. Also include the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”‍
7. Your physical or electronic signature

Send the written notification via regular postal mail to the following:
