Copyright Infringement.
-----------------------

As Qualified asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by Qualified violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify Qualified. Qualified will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. In the case of a visitor who may infringe or repeatedly infringes the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Qualified or others, Qualified may, in its discretion, terminate or deny access to and use of the Website. In the case of such termination, Qualified will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Qualified. The form of notice set forth below is consistent with the form suggested by the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") which may be found at the U.S. Copyright official website: http://www.copyright.gov.

To expedite Qualified’s handling of your notice, please use the following format or refer to Section 512(c)(3) of the Copyright Act.

1. Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed upon. This includes identification of the web page or specific posts, as opposed to entire sites. Posts must be referenced by either the dates in which they appear or by the permalink of the post. Include the URL to the concerned material infringing your copyright (URL of a website or URL to a post, with title, date, name of the emitter), or link to initial post with sufficient data to find it.
2. Identify the material that you allege is infringing upon the copyrighted work listed in Item #1 above. Include the name of the concerned litigious material (all images or posts if relevant) with its complete reference.
3. Provide information on which Qualified may contact you, including your email address, name, telephone number and physical address.‍
4. Provide the address, if available, to allow Qualified to notify the owner/ administrator of the allegedly infringing webpage or other content, including email address.‍
5. Also include a statement of the following: “I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.”‍
6. Also include the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”‍
7. Your physical or electronic signature

Send the written notification via regular postal mail to the following:
