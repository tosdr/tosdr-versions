**What Is Personally Identifiable Information?**
------------------------------------------------

“**PII**”, “**Personally Identifiable Information**”, and/or “**Personal Information**” means any information which may identify an individual, directly or indirectly or, if you are in  the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”) or United Kingdom (“**UK**”) any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. Examples of PII include, but are not limited to, first and last names, home address, billing address or other physical address, email address, telephone number, etc. PII does not include information which is anonymized, and other information which is excluded from the scope of applicable privacy and data protection laws.

How we use your information
---------------------------

Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with Codewars in ways that require Codewars to gather Personally Identifiable Information. The amount and type of information that Codewars gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at codewars.com to provide an email address, and other information necessary for processing payments. In each case, Codewars collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Codewars.  Visitors can always refuse to supply Personally Identifiable Information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

We use the Personal Information we collect:

* To provide, maintain, improve, and enhance our Services.
* To communicate with you, provide you with updates and other information relating to our Services, provide information that you request, respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide customer service and support.
* For marketing purposes, such as developing and providing promotional and advertising materials that may be useful, relevant, valuable, or otherwise of interest to you, to market events, promotions, competitions, webinars, reports, our services, news, or relevant industry updates.
* To personalize your experience of our Services such as presenting tailored content.
* To conduct research to understand and analyze how you use our Services and develop new products, services, and features.
* To facilitate your interest in one of our education partners we will send your information to the partner with your permission.

* To identify your contributions to a coding challenge (kata) by username and profile link.  If you delete your account the solution will become anonymized.
* To process payments for subscriptions via a third-party payment service.
* To find and prevent fraud and respond to trust and safety issues that may arise.
* For compliance purposes, including enforcing our legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency.
* To enforce and comply with legislations, including to conduct an investigation, to protect the property and rights of Codewars or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, fraudulent, unethical or legally actionable activity.  
* For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time the Personal Information is collected.

‍

**Legal Bases for Processing European Personal Information**

If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we only process your Personal Information when we have a valid “legal basis,” including as set forth below.

● **Consent.** You have consented to the use of your Personal Information. For example, we may process your Personal Information to send you marketing communications or to use Cookies where you have consented to such use.

● **Contractual Necessity**. We need your Personal Information to provide you with our Services. For example, we may need to process your Personal Information to respond to your inquiries or requests.

● **Compliance with a Legal Obligation**. We have a legal obligation to use your Personal Information. For example, we may process your Personal Information to comply with tax and accounting obligations.

●   **Legitimate Interests**. We or a third party have a legitimate interest in using your Personal Information. Specifically, we have a legitimate interest in using your Personal Information for product development and internal analytics purposes, and otherwise to improve the safety, security, and performance of our Services. We only rely on our or a third party’s legitimate interests to process your Personal Information when these interests are not overridden by your rights and interests.

**How We Share Personally Identifiable Information**  
------------------------------------------------------

**Affiliates.** We may share your Personal Information with our affiliates for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

**Vendors, Affiliate Partners and Service Providers**. We may share any Personal Information we receive with vendors, affiliate partners and service providers retained in connection with the provision of our Services. Codewars actively engages third-party resources, applications, and websites. These services provided by third parties are established to enhance user experience, provide ease of navigation through Codewars’s sites, and to promote access to information. Codewars may provide PII of Users to only those of its personnel and third-party vendors that (1) need to know such information to process it on Codewars’s behalf or to provide services as described above, and (2) have agreed in writing not to disclose it to any other parties without Codewars’s consent. Some of those employees, contractors, vendors, affiliate partners and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Site and/or Services, you consent to the transfer of information to such individuals and organizations to accomplish these purposes.

**Marketing**. Codewars does not buy or sell PII for its business practices or for commercial purposes unless we have your permission. From time to time, Codewars may engage in joint marketing events with select business partners. If you register for a joint webinar or specifically express an interest in a jointly offered product, promotion or service, we may share relevant PII with those partner(s). Where you have given your consent to do so, these business partners may send you marketing communications about their own products and services.

**Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions**: We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness, or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winner’s list.

**Social Networks and Other Online Services**. Please note that Codewars does not control, moderate, or endorse any comments or opinions provided by visitors on third-party websites. The use and creation of official Codewars accounts may cause PII to become available or accessible to Codewars. Such information may become available to Codewars when a user provides, submits, communicates, links, posts, or associates information with designated Codewars accounts on social media (e.g., by using “hashtags”, “liking”, “friending”, “tweeting”, commenting on any content or media on our designated accounts). At times, Codewars, through its personnel, employees, officers, directors, agents, and assignees, may respond publicly to content or media made available though “share,” “retweet,” “friend,” “follow,” or similar activities, or respond publicly on content made on designated and official Codewars and Andela accounts. Codewars may disseminate any of such information or PII to law enforcement officials, as required by law or court order.

**Analytics Partners.** We use analytics services such as Looker, Braze, Zendesk, ipapi.co and DataDog and Sentry to collect and process certain analytics data. These services may also collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources. You can learn more about Google’s practices by visiting [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). To help us understand how you use our Services and to help us improve them, we automatically receive Personal Information about your interactions with our Services, like the pages or other content you view, the searches you conduct, purchases you make, your comments, any content you post, and the dates and times of your visits.

**Advertising Partners.** We work with third-party advertising partners such as BuySellAds and Ethical Ads to show you ads that we think may interest you If you do not wish to receive personalized ads, please visit their opt-out pages to learn about how you may opt-out of receiving web-based personalized ads from member companies. You can access any settings offered by your mobile operating system to limit ad tracking, or you can install the AppChoices mobile app to learn more about how you may opt-out of personalized ads in mobile apps.

**As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures.** We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (b) respond to your requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations, including law enforcement agencies, for the purposes of fraud protection and to prevent cyber or other suspected or alleged crimes. For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your Personal Information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the Services.

**Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.** We may disclose your Personal Information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company, or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets.
