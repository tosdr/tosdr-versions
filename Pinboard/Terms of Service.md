Terms of Service
================

Scope of Service
----------------

Pinboard supports the following browsers:

* Safari (v5+)
* Firefox (v4+)
* Chrome (v13+)
* Internet Explorer (v8+)
* Opera (v12+)

While I will try to make the site compatible on as many browsers as possible, I can't guarantee the site will work on browsers not on this list.

  

Rights
------

You can choose to remain anonymous. The only signup requirements are payment and a working email address.

You have the right to export your bookmarks from the site at any time, subject to reasonable constraints on bandwidth.

You can close your account at any time by using the link in your user profile.

Your private bookmarks will not be intentionally shown to other users or shared with third parties.

There will be no gratuitous redesigns.

Your personal data, including your browsing history, email address and identity will not be shared with anyone without your consent.

When logged in, you will not be served any third-party content (scripts, cookies, or images).

Your data will be backed up regularly, and the backups tested.

If there is a significant outage, you will receive a full explanation of the circumstances and what measures will be taken to prevent a recurrence.

If the site ceases operation, you will receive an opportunity to download your stored data in a format suitable for import into other bookmarking services.

You have the right to receive an explanation, and when possible advance warning, if your account is throttled or cancelled for the reasons outlined below.

Any new features that affect privacy will be strictly opt-in. The same goes for new features that substantially alter the site.

You will be treated with respect and discretion, no matter what you bookmark. Fandom especially is welcome here.

  

Responsibilities
----------------

You may not make automated requests to the site more frequently than once every thirty seconds.

Posting links with the primary goal of directing traffic to outside sites, or increasing their search engine visibility, will be construed as spam and may result in account cancellation.

You must not abuse the site by knowingly posting malicious code, or links to malicious sites, that could harm other users. If you find a security or privacy bug in Pinboard, I ask that you [please report it to me](https://pinboard.in/security/) right away by private email.

You may not use the site to harass other users.

I reserve the right to throttle or close accounts consuming an unreasonable proportion of site resources (thousands of bookmarks per day, for example).

You cannot archive content illegal under California law.

  

Archiving
---------

At the moment, it is not possible to archive links that are not visible on the public Internet.

Archiving is not likely to work for most popular video sites.

You may not publish links to archived bookmarks. If you would like to publish a cached version of a bookmark, please copy it to your own server first.

You have the right to a periodic full download of your archived content, subject to reasonable constraints on bandwidth use.
