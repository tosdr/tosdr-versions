Privacy Policy
==============

  

Pinboard started life as a more private alternative to social bookmarking, and remains unmatched in its focus on user privacy.

I do not share user data with third parties under any circumstances.

The site does not and will never show ads.

All revenue comes from paid subscriptions, removing the need for any type of tracking.

The site runs on its own dedicated servers and does not use third-party services or libraries. This includes Google Analytics and any other tracking tool.

You are free to use Pinboard anonymously, and not to give the site your real name. The only requirement is that you provide a working email address, in case I need to contact you.

What you save on Pinboard is your own business, and with the exception of illegal or abusive content, will not be moderated by the site.

Pinboard does not store your payment information. Payment is handled through PayPal or Stripe, but if you are uncomfortable using those services, alternative arrangements are available.

Pinboard earns all of its revenue through user subscriptions, and has no business relationship with large surveillance-based platforms like Facebook, Amazon or Google.

The site tracks click-throughs on your bookmarks for the sole purpose of generating a 'history' page for your account, intended for your personal use. You can disable this behavior on the settings page.

If there is a privacy breach, I promise to disclose it as soon as possible on the site blog and Twitter account.

If you choose to delete your account, all your data will be removed after a 30-day waiting period.

If you spot a privacy leak, please report it to [support@pinboard.in](mailto:support@pinboard.in).

While I do my best to keep data private and secure, please do not store truly sensitive information on Pinboard.
