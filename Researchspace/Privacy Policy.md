Terms & Conditions
==================

Thanks for using RSpace! These terms of service (“Terms”) cover your use and access to the services, client software and websites (“Services”) provided by Research Space. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.researchspace.com/privacy-policy) explains how we collect and use your information while our Acceptable Use Policy (see lower down this page) outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, and to review our [Privacy](https://www.researchspace.com/privacy-policy) and Acceptable Use policies. If you’re using our Services for an organization, you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization.

Your Things & Your Permissions
------------------------------

When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, email messages, contacts and so on (“Your Things”). Your Things are yours. These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Things except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.

We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Things, backing them up, and sharing them when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like photo thumbnails, document previews, easy sorting, editing, sharing and searching. These and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Things. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to trusted third parties we work with.

Sharing Your Things
-------------------

Our Services let you share Your Things with others, so please think carefully about what you share.

Your Responsibilities
---------------------

You’re responsible for your conduct, Your Things and you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy. Content in the Services may be protected by others’ intellectual property rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download or share content unless you have the right to do so.

We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy. With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren’t responsible for the content people enter and share via the Services.

Please safeguard your password to the Services, make sure that others don’t have access to it, and keep your account information current.

Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people under the age of 13. By using our Services, you are representing to us that you’re over 13.

Software
--------

Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“Software”) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.

Our Things
----------

The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. These Terms don’t grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, others’ content in the Services, RSpace trademark, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.

Copyright
---------

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using the standard DMCA takedown notice format (see example template [here](https://www.minclaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sample-DMCA-Takedown-Notice.pdf)). We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.  Notices of alleged copyright infringement on the Services  should be sent to:

Research Space  
16 Charlotte Square  
Edinburgh EH2 4DF

Scotland

RSpace Team & Enterprise
------------------------

_Using RSpace Team or Enterprise_. If you join an RSpace Team or Enterprise account, you must use it in compliance with your employer’s terms and policies. Please note that RSpace Team and Enterprise accounts are subject to your employer’s control. Your administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your RSpace Team or Enterprise account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to an RSpace Team or Enterprise's account.

Termination
-----------

You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you’re not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others’ use of the Services. We reserve the right to terminate and delete your account if you haven’t accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months. We’ll of course provide you with notice via the email address associated with your account before we do so.

Services “AS IS”
----------------

We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can’t guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RESEARCH SPACE MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL RESEARCH SPACE BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT RESEARCH SPACE HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN US$20. Some states don’t allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

Resolving Disputes
------------------

_Let’s Try To Sort Things Out First_. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Research Space, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting info@researchspace.com. We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Research Space may bring a formal proceeding.

_We Both Agree To Arbitrate_. You and Research Space agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.

_Arbitration Procedures_. The [Scottish Arbitration Centre](http://www.scottisharbitrationcentre.org/) (SAC) will administer the arbitration under the [Scottish Arbitration Rules](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2010/1/schedule/1). The arbitration will be held in Scotland, or any other location we agree to.

_Arbitration Fees_. The SAC rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.

_Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate_.  Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.

_No Class Actions_. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed.

_Judicial forum for disputes_. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Research Space agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the courts of Scotland.  Both you and Research Space consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

Controlling Law
---------------

These Terms will be governed by Scottish law except for its conflicts of laws principles.

Entire Agreement
----------------

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Research Space with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.

Waiver, Severability & Assignment
---------------------------------

Research Space’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Research Space may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

Modifications
-------------

We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

RSpace Acceptable Use Policy
----------------------------

We trust you to use our services responsibly.

In exchange, you agree not to misuse the RSpace services (“Services”) or help anyone else to do so. For example, you must not even try to do any of the following in connection with the Services:

* probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network;
* breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication measures;
* access, tamper with, or use non-public areas or parts of the Services, or shared areas of the Services you haven’t been invited to;
* interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network, for example by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing any part of the Services;
* upload unreasonably large datasets or an unreasonably large amount of data;
* access, search, or create accounts for the Services by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces (for example, “scraping” or creating accounts in bulk);
* send unsolicited communications, promotions or advertisements, or spam;
* send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information, including “spoofing” or “phishing”;
* promote or advertise products or services other than your own without appropriate authorization;
* abuse referrals or promotions to get more storage space than deserved;
* circumvent storage space limits;
* sell the Services unless specifically authorized to do so;
* publish or share materials that are unlawfully pornographic or indecent, or that contain extreme acts of violence;
* advocate bigotry or hatred against any person or group of people based on their race, religion, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual preference, disability, or impairment;
* violate the law in any way, including storing, publishing or sharing material that’s fraudulent, defamatory, or misleading; or
* violate the privacy or infringe the rights of others.
