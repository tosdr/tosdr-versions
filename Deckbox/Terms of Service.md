### Terms and Conditions

Last Modified: 10th January 2024.

Thank you for using Deckbox! These terms of service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of Deckbox (“we” or “our”) websites and services, so please carefully read them before using Deckbox.

#### Using Deckbox means accepting these terms

By accessing or using Deckbox in any way, whether you have created your own Deckbox account or are accessing Deckbox public content, or are just browsing around, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.

You may use Deckbox only in compliance with these Terms. You may use Deckbox only if you have the power to form a contract with Deckbox and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. Deckbox may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features. We may stop, suspend, or modify Deckbox at any time without prior notice to you. We may also remove any content from Deckbox at our discretion.

#### Deckbox is a Venue

Deckbox acts as a venue to allow users who comply with its policies to trade and discuss collectible card games. We are not directly involved in the transaction between traders. As a result, we have no control over the quality, legality of any aspect of the cards listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of traders to send items. We cannot ensure (or force) a trader to complete a transaction.

Consequently, we do not transfer legal ownership of items between users when traded.

We cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. We encourage you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site. You may also wish to consider using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.

You use the Deckbox service at your own risk.

#### Trading

By trading on deckbox, you agree to all our rules terms described in the rules document: [Deckbox Trading Rules](https://deckbox.org/help/trade_rules). Please consult our [privacy policy](https://deckbox.org/privacy) for more information about personal data handling.

#### Disputes with users or third parties

In the event a dispute arises between you and another user or a third party, we encourage you to contact the user or third party to resolve the dispute amicably. You may also report user-to-user disputes to your local law enforcement, postmaster general, or a certified mediation or arbitration entity, as applicable. To involve Deckbox in a resolution process, please read section 4 of our [Deckbox Trading Rules](https://deckbox.org/help/trade_rules), which refers to handling trade disputes. You release Deckbox (and Deckbox's officers, directors, agents, moderators and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with disputes with one or more users, or an outside party.

#### Breach of Terms

If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use Deckbox automatically terminates. Any materials downloaded or printed from Deckbox in violation of the Terms of Service must be immediately destroyed.

We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of Deckbox at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.

If you think we removed your access by mistake, let us know and we’ll give you our reasoning. We also have a quick way to restore access without losing any of your data.

#### Account Security

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access Deckbox and you agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for any activity using your account, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify Deckbox of any unauthorized use of your account. You acknowledge that if you wish to protect your transmission of data to Deckbox, it is your responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection to communicate with Deckbox.

#### Your Stuff

By using our Services you provide us with information that you submit to Deckbox. You retain full ownership to your stuff. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property.

#### Reliability

Although we are constantly looking for ways to improve our service and its quality for our customers, we cannot always guarantee 100% uptime of our services. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet. We monitor Deckbox closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email and SMS) when the Deckbox service is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.

#### Play Nice

To insure the best experience for all our customers, you agree to never:

* Collect, harvest, mine or engage in any other activity to obtain e-mail addresses, phone numbers, personal information or any other information about others.
* Use or attempt to gain access to or use another’s user or company account, password, data, or computer systems or networks connected to any Deckbox server, whether through hacking, password mining or any other means.
* Access or attempt to access any material that you are not authorized to access.
* Use any materials in any manner that infringes any intellectual property rights or other rights of any party.
* Disrupt or interfere with the security of, or otherwise cause harm to, the Deckbox service, Leaping Frog Studios materials, systems resources, accounts, passwords, servers or networks connected to or accessible through Deckbox or any affiliated or linked sites.
* Create a false identity for the purpose of misleading others.
* Disrupt, interfere or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Deckbox service or other affiliated or linked sites, materials or services.
* Access or use Deckbox in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair any Deckbox server or the network(s) connected to any Deckbox server.
* Violate any applicable laws or regulations related to the access to or use of Deckbox, or engage in any activity prohibited by the Terms of Service.
* Post or otherwise submit any topic, name, material or information that is child pornography, defamatory, excessively violent, harassing, inappropriate, indecent, lascivious, lewd, obscene, profane, racist, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable.
* Engage in any chain letters, contests, junk e-mail, pyramid schemes, spamming, surveys or any other duplicative or unsolicited messages (commercial or otherwise).
* Market any goods or services for any business purpose (including advertising and making offers to buy or sell goods or services), unless specifically allowed to do so by Leaping Frog Studios.

#### Special Treatment for Spammers

In the event of your or others’ access to or use of the Deckbox service in connection with the transmission of spam unsolicited e-mail or postings in violation of these Terms of Service, you acknowledge and agree that Leaping Frog Studios would be irreparably harmed thereunder and that monetary damages would be an insufficient and ineffective remedy; therefore you agree that Leaping Frog Studios is entitled to obtain immediate injunctive relief against any such transmission (in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity). Leaping Frog Studios may without restriction block, filter or delete unsolicited e-mail.
