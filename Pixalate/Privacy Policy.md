Pixalate Privacy Policy
=======================

Last updated and effective as of 01 February 2024

Pixalate Europe Limited and its affiliates (“Pixalate,” “we,” “us” or “our”) are committed to protecting the privacy of individuals. Because we know that you care the most about your individual privacy, this Pixalate Privacy Policy is designed to inform you as to how we collect, use, retain, correct, disclose, and share "personal data," which is defined as any information relating to a living individual by which such individual may be identified or be identifiable.

1\. What sites and services are covered by this Privacy Policy?

This Privacy Policy describes Pixalate’s privacy practices in relation to our corporate website, www.pixalate.com (the “Website”), and the online services that we offer (collectively, the “Services”), which our clients use to benchmark digital advertising inventory supply quality, identify and filter out potentially fraudulent digital advertising inventory, and comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws globally. Our Privacy Policy applies to personal data collected: (i) in connection with operation of, access to, and use of our Website and Services, (ii) when our clients, prospective clients and business partners express interest in learning more about Pixalate and our Services, and (iii) in connection with the day-to-day operation of our business.

For our Website and/or our Services, this Privacy Policy details our practices, provides transparency and specifies contact mechanisms relating to our collection, use, retention, correction, deletion, disclosure, and sharing of personal data, and the associated procedures relating thereto. In addition to this Privacy Policy, your use of our Website and Services is subject to our Terms of Use ([https://www.pixalate.com/terms](https://www.pixalate.com/terms?hsLang=en)).

2\. What do we do with personal data collected in connection via our Website and Services?

To power portions of our Website, and provide our Services, we process the categories of personal data detailed in Section 3 below. We use such personal data to: (i) analyze the quality of digital advertising opportunities, (ii) provide digital advertising inventory fraud detection Services, (iii) generate digital advertising inventory quality-related rankings, reports and indices, and (iv) provide legal compliance tools. Because of the nature of our Services, we do not combine such collected data with any other data in order to personally identify any individual, human users.

3\. What technologies are used, and data types are collected, in connection with operation of our Website and Services?

_Cookies__._ Cookies are small packets of data that are transmitted to an internet browser’s storage medium in order to enable the browser to “remember” information such as page visits, user log-in information, and other related records of online activity. In addition to using cookies in connection with fraud detection, fraud prevention, legal compliance and digital advertisement quality determinations, we use cookies on our Website and Services as a means to prevent unauthorized access to client-specific, secure content and reports. Please note that, when accessing client-specific, secure content, you are acting as a representative of your organization and your interactions with our Website and/or Services in this capacity will be governed by the master subscription terms, master services agreement, terms of use, or other agreements establishing your organization’s rights and obligations with respect to access to and use of our Website and/or Services.

_Pixel tags, script tags, SDKs, and macros__._ Pixel tags (small, transparent images present on web pages) and script tags (used to define a client-side JavaScript) allow an operator of a web page, a developer of an app, or a third party serving a tag, to set, read, and modify cookies and to collect information directly from internet-connected browsers, devices or systems. In connection with use of an internet browser (on a desktop computer or mobile device), a mobile application, or any other internet-connected media-viewing system (e.g., connected television and so-called over-the-top media technologies; collectively, "CTV") upon which pixel tags, script tags, software development kits (which enable third-party code to run in a mobile or an CTV application; “SDKs”), or other software code snippets (known as “Macros”) are deployed, our servers or our clients’ servers, as applicable, automatically collect and log certain information. Such logs may include information about the browser, mobile application or CTV system or device accessing a page, application or media, including internet protocol (“IP”) address, browser, user agent, application, device or system, referring URL, information about the page, application or media where a digital advertisement was to be displayed, the advertisement’s dimensions, location and viewability, and generalized user interaction data. We use this information to power aspects of our Website and provide our Services (i.e., for fraud detection, fraud prevention, legal compliance and digital advertisement quality assessment purposes).

_Location Information._ We derive your general (i.e., non-precise) location information from your system's or device's IP address, and we may process and store – subject to expedited purging in accordance with our data retention policy – non-precise location information received via digital programmatic advertising auction bid requests in connection with our fraud detection and prevention Services. Other than postal addresses that may be provided in connection with client payment obligations for certain Services, neither our Website nor our Services require, or utilize, any precise geographic location information.

4\. What specific data types are collected and received in connection with day-to-day operation of our business, including with respect to our billing and support of existing clients, marketing and sales to prospective and existing clients, and human resources-related activities?

In connection with the day-to-day operation of our business, we collect and receive the following categories of information:

* _Contact information._ We collect contact information from: (i) visitors to our Website, (ii) direct marketing outreach efforts, (iii) third-party marketing automation tools, (iv) our clients’ use of our Services, and (v) our client’s submission of contact information of themselves and/or their business partners (collectively, “Contact Information”). Contact Information may be provided via telephonic, email or text communications, or browser-based forms, and may include first name, last name, email address, job title, name of the organization, street number and name, state/province/region, country, phone numbers (cell and/or landline), and other information reasonably required for us to respond and engage properly and expeditiously. This Contact Information may be used by our sales, customer success, human resources, legal affairs, and/or finance teams to contact our Website visitors, Services clients, and client prospects, as permissible under applicable law, so that we may provide information (including marketing materials), support, training and/or our Services.  In addition, if you submit Contact Information for a third party to Pixalate (e.g., through a Service trial referral form) you authorize Pixalate to disclose to such third party that you provided us with the individual’s Contact Information.  Such disclosure may include your name, title, and any organization affiliation(s).
* _Billing information._ We collect financial, billing and payment information from our clients, prospective clients (in connection with credit checks), and third-party vendors, which may include purchase order numbers, account numbers, credit reports, and/or instructions for wire, automated clearing house (ACH) or bankers automated clearing services (BACS) transfers. This billing and payment information may be used to prepare and send invoices, make and receive payments, and otherwise manage our clients’ and third-party vendors’ accounts.

5\. What technologies are used, and what data types are collected and used, in connection with our day-to-day business operations?

_Automatic data collection__._ Like most organizations with an online presence, we rely upon automatic data collection technology, including third-party technologies (e.g., Google Analytics), when you access and use our Website and Services. These third-party services may use online tracking technologies to collect information such as your system's or device's IP address, internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, search query content, access dates and times, amounts of time spent on particular pages, what sections of our Website or Services you visit, number of links you click while on our Website or Services, search terms, and other data.

Please be advised that if you disable, restrict, or block cookies, or similarly opt out of or otherwise limit the performance of our Website or Services, or related services performed by any third party vendor, you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Website and Services. (For more information on Google Analytics, including how to opt out from certain data collection, please visit [https://www.google.com/analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics).)

_Other third-party services__._ Third-party services incorporated into our Website, such as social media widgets (e.g., LinkedIn Like button or the Twitter Share button), online advertising networks or job applicant tracking services, may collect information about your visits to our Website for other purposes, including interest-based advertising. You may choose to provide information voluntarily to such third-party service providers, and the information that they collect may include personal data such as IP addresses, pages visited, times and dates of visits, browser or operating system configuration, and other usage data. Third-party service providers may combine information that you provide with information collected from other sites and/or apps. Because we do not host or control such third-party services, your interactions with these services will not be governed by this Privacy Policy; instead, such interactions will be governed by the privacy policy of the third-party service provider.

_Use of aggregated data__._ In an ongoing effort to better understand our Website visitors and Services clients, we may analyze information in an aggregated form to operate, maintain, manage, and improve our Website and Services. We may share aggregated data – and insights derived therefrom – with our clients and Website visitors, as well as with our agents and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated statistics to prospective business partners and other third parties, in order to describe our Website and Services and for other lawful purposes.

_Additional data uses__._ We also use Contact Information, billing information, and other information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy to respond to general inquiries, solicit feedback regarding our Website or Services, deploy – and provide training and support for – our Services, provide relevant content on our Website and for our Services, and communicate with you via email and/or text regarding our current and future Services.

**6\. What specific data protection and privacy rights are afforded to users from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), or Switzerland?**

If you are a resident of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, you have the following data protection rights, which you may exercise at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided in Section 23 below:

* the right to access your personal data and confirm the existence of processing;
* the right to correct, update or request anonymization, blocking or deletion of your personal data;
* the right to object to processing of your personal data when it is based on our legitimate interests;
* the right to ask us, in some situations, to restrict processing of your personal data or request portability of your personal data;
* the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.
    * You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us using the contact mechanisms provided in Section 23 below;
* if we have collected and process your personal data with your consent, then the right to withdraw your consent at any time;
    * Please note that withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent;
* the right to request the review of decisions exclusively based in automated processing, which might affect your interests; and
* the right to complain to a data protection authority (DPA) about our collection and use of your personal data.
    * For more information, please contact your local DPA.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that our records may be updated or corrected.

**7\. What are the legal bases under which the personal data of European data subjects may be processed under the European Union (“EU”)’s General Data Protection Regulation, and corresponding data protection regulations in the UK and Switzerland (collectively, such European regulations are referred to herein as the “GDPR”)?**

“Fraud prevention” is an express legal basis under Article 6 and Recital 47 of the GDPR. As used herein, and in accordance with the GDPR, identified or identifiable human end users in the EU, the UK or Switzerland, as applicable, are referred to as “Data Subjects.” Article 6 of the GDPR requires one or more legal bases for the processing of Data Subjects’ personal data. The GDPR provides a right to process the personal data of Data Subjects to further a company’s own “legitimate interests,” or the legitimate interests of a third party, provided that doing so will not infringe adversely upon the fundamental rights and freedoms of the applicable Data Subjects.

Recital 47 of the GDPR states expressly that the “processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud” constitutes a legitimate interest, and such provision serves as our primary legal basis for the processing of Data Subjects’ personal data in connection with operation of our Website and Services.

_Express consent is a legal basis under Article 6 of the GDPR._ Another permissible legal basis for processing a Data Subject’s personal data is express consent from the Data Subject. We may utilize such basis from time to time in connection with our direct marketing efforts to Data Subjects. With respect to the processing of client and client-prospect personal data relating to Pixalate’s Website and Services, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that our consent mechanisms for obtaining personal data of Data Subjects enable them to understand what consent(s) they are providing, and why and how we use such consent(s); and we give clear, defined ways to consent to us controlling and/or processing such Data Subject personal data. Where we use any third party to process Data Subjects’ personal data on our behalf (e.g., employee payroll, recruitment, and benefits), we will enter into reasonable data-processor agreements and establish (and update from time to time) due diligence procedures for ensuring that they (as well as we), meet and understand their/our GDPR obligations. These measures will include initial and ongoing reviews of the service provided, the necessity of the processing activity, and the technical and organizational measures in place to ensure reasonable data protection and compliance with the GDPR.

Pixalate participates in the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (TCFv2.2) as Vendor ID 384. As detailed herein, "legitimate interest" under the GDPR serves as the legal basis for our processing of personal data for the following purposes:

* Ensuring security, preventing and detecting fraud, and fixing errors (Special Purpose 1); and
* Developing and improving our Services (Purpose 10).

  

_Safeguards regarding data transfer of personal data to third parties._ Where a third party to which we are transferring personal data is acting as:

* a data controller, we ensure, contractually, that such: (i) third party complies with applicable Data Subjects’ rights and choices, and (ii) data may only be processed for limited and specified purposes (e.g., fraud prevention). Where consent serves as a legal basis for processing, we ensure, contractually, that: (A) the processing will be consistent with the consent provided by the Data Subject, (B) the third party will provide at least the same level of information security and privacy protection as Pixalate provides, and (C) the third party will notify us promptly if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet these contractual obligations; or
* our agent (or other third-party vendors performing processing services at our instruction and on our behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law), we ensure, contractually, that: (i) such data is only processed for limited and specified purposes (e.g., fraud prevention), and (ii) such third party: (A) provides at least the same level of information security and privacy protection as Pixalate provides, (B) processes the personal data transferred in a manner consistent with our obligations specified herein, and (C) notifies us promptly if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet these contractual obligations. (We will provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of our contract with the applicable third party to government authorities upon request.)

In the event that a third party data controller or processor to which we are transferring personal data makes a determination that it can no longer meet its information security and privacy obligations to us as referenced above, the applicable contract will require cessation of processing and other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate any such failure.

_Hosting on third-party platforms._ Pixalate’s Services run on Amazon Web Services (“**AWS**”) and the Google Cloud Platform. The EU data protection authorities, acting collectively as the Article 29 Working Party, approved: (i) Google’s “model clauses” based agreements for its Cloud Platform, and (ii) Amazon’s AWS Data Processing Agreement (DPA).

**8\. What data protection and privacy rights are afforded to users from the United States?**

If you are based in the United States, the data controller of your personal data is Pixalate Europe Limited (incorporated in Ireland with Company No. 655291), and your data may be processed and stored in the United States, the EEA, or the UK. For contact details, please see Section 23 below.

10\. Under what circumstances would data be transferred, and what safeguards are in place regarding data transfer?

Onward transfer of data to third parties. Like many businesses, we hire third-party vendors to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose personal data to certain types of third-party service providers but only to the extent reasonably required to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal data, and their functions include: direct marketing assistance, billing, client service, data processing and storage, Website and Services hosting, and disaster-recovery services. All such third-party vendors perform such services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts that incorporate the [standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1621860018361000&usg=AOvVaw0JQfcmF9zrQ9awW_p9h6yl) and require at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and applicable law, and as implemented by Pixalate. In addition, as required by the the European Union ("EU")-United States ("U.S.") Data Privacy Framework, the United Kingdom ("UK") Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF, as applicable, we will remain liable if a third party that we engage to process personal data on our behalf does so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the matter giving rise to the damage. With respect to your personal data collected via our marketing efforts, you may opt out of having such personal data transferred to any or all of our categories of agents – and other third-party vendors performing such services at our instruction and on our behalf – by contacting us at [privacy@pixalate.com](mailto:privacy@pixalate.com). Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request.

_Business-transaction-related transfers__._ In the event of a merger, dissolution, reorganization or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal data, would be transferred to the surviving entity in such a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be in accordance with applicable law, and subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such personal data as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is binding upon Pixalate and its legal successors in interest.

* _Disclosure of personal data in connection with legal and administrative proceedings__._ We are required from time to time to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also be required to disclose personal data in the course of defending ourselves in litigation, and to third parties when compelled to do so by governmental authorities or as otherwise required by law or regulation (including, but not limited to, in response to court and administrative orders and subpoenas). In all such circumstances, we will make reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality of such personal data.

11\. May you review, correct, modify or delete any of your personal data that we possess?

You may request to review, correct, modify, or delete any of the personal data that you have previously provided to us. To update your billing information, or request return or deletion of your data associated with your account, please contact your account representative or our customer success team. For other requests to access, correct, modify or delete your personal data, please email [privacy@pixalate.com](mailto:privacy@pixalate.com). Requests to access, change, or delete your personal data will be addressed within a reasonable timeframe, and in accordance with periods established under applicable law.

12\. How long is personal data retained?

We will retain your personal data in a form that identifies you, or may be used to identify you, only for as long as it reasonably serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected, or for a purpose that you authorized subsequently, and, in both circumstances, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. In the event that we continue processing your personal data for longer periods, it will only be for the time and to the extent reasonably required for a lawful and permissible purpose (e.g., archival, compelling public interest, journalism, literature, scientific or historical research, and statistical analysis), and subject to the protections afforded by this Privacy Policy and applicable law. After such time periods have expired, we may either delete your personal data or retain it in an anonymous form that does not identify you personally.

13\. What steps are taken to safeguard personal data?

Pixalate takes protection of the security and privacy of personal data that we collect pursuant to this Privacy Policy very seriously. Accordingly, we have implemented and will maintain reasonable and appropriate technical, administrative, and physical measures designed to: (i) prevent unauthorized access to the Website and Services, and (ii) protect personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We will take into account the risks involved in processing, and the nature of such personal data, and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

**17\. Does Pixalate comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework?**

On 10 July 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the European Union ("EU")-United States ("U.S.") Data Privacy Framework ("DPF"). The adequacy decision concludes that the U.S. ensures an adequate level of protection – compared to that of the EU - for personal data transferred from the EU to U.S. companies participating in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. The EU-U.S. DPF, United Kingdom ("UK") Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF (collectively, the "DPFs") were respectively developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission, UK Government, and Swiss Federal Administration to provide U.S. organizations with reliable mechanisms for personal data transfers to the U.S. from the EU, UK, and Switzerland while ensuring data protection that is consistent with EU, UK, and Swiss law.

Pixalate has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the DPFs.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the applicable DPF(s), such DPF(s) shall govern.  To learn more about the framework applicable to the DPFs, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov.](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)

**18\. What is the process for resolving complaints about Pixalate’s collection or use of personal data?**

In accordance with the framework applicable to the DPFs, Pixalate commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data.  EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our policy should first contact Pixalate via email at privacy@pixalate.com, or via mail at:

Pixalate Europe Limited  
20 North Audley Street  
London, W1K 6WE, United Kingdom  
Attn: Legal Affairs Department

Pixalate has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs), UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU and Switzerland.

**19\. Which U.S. governmental agency has** **investigatory and enforcement powers regarding Pixalate?**

Pixalate is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

**20\. Is it possible, under certain conditions, for individuals to invoke binding arbitration?**

Yes, is it possible, under certain conditions, for individuals to invoke binding arbitration to resolve disputes relating to this Privacy Policy and applicable law. In order to address privacy-related complaints not resolved by other means, Pixalate offers a binding arbitration option in such circumstances. Any such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the UK Arbitration Act 1996 by the International Chamber of Commerce (“**ICC**”) under its 2021 Arbitration Rules and Expedited Procedure Provisions. These rules and provisions are available on the ICC website or by sending an email to [info@iccwbo.uk](mailto:info@iccwbo.uk).

_“Do Not Track” signals__._ Currently, various browsers – including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. At present, Pixalate does not respond to browsers' DNT signals with respect to our Website or Services. Pixalate takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will implement global privacy controls (GPC) in accordance with applicable law, and will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of any such standards.

Per the [MRC](http://www.mediaratingcouncil.org/063014%20Viewable%20Ad%20Impression%20Guideline_Final.pdf), “'Fraud' is not intended to represent fraud as defined in various laws, statutes and ordinances or as conventionally used in U.S. Court or other legal proceedings, but rather a custom definition strictly for advertising measurement purposes. Also per the [MRC](http://mediaratingcouncil.org/101515_IVT%20Addendum%20FINAL%20(Version%201.0).pdf), “‘Invalid Traffic’ is defined generally as traffic that does not meet certain ad serving quality or completeness criteria, or otherwise does not represent legitimate ad traffic that should be included in measurement counts. Among the reasons why ad traffic may be deemed invalid is it is a result of non-human traffic (spiders, bots, etc.), or activity designed to produce fraudulent traffic.”
