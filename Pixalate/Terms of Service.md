Effective as of 15 September 2023

**1\. Introduction**.  
  

Pixalate Europe Limited and its affiliates (“Pixalate,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) are a global ad fraud intelligence and marketing group, working with brands and digital advertising platforms to detect invalid traffic (“IVT”), improve digital advertising inventory quality, and provide application ("app") and site insights to enable the crafting of ideal digital advertising inventory supply at scale and in alignment with your individual marketing standards. We offer the only system of coordinated solutions across desktop, mobile web, mobile in-app, and over-the-top (“OTT”)/connected television (“CTV”) advertising.

By clicking “I accept,” “I agree,” “Subscribe,” “Sign Up,” “Download Now,” “Schedule a Demo,” “Download the Complete Index,” or similar prompts, or by otherwise registering, accessing or using our services, including a free-of-charge [Media Ratings Terminal (“](https://ratings.pixalate.com/)[MRT](https://ratings.pixalate.com/)[”)](https://ratings.pixalate.com/) basic offering, and our [Ad Trust and Safety (ATS) application programming interfaces (“](https://developer.pixalate.com/)[APIs](https://developer.pixalate.com/)[”)](https://developer.pixalate.com/), including our "[Ad Fraud API](https://developer.pixalate.com/products/ad-fraud-api)" and "[Enrichment API](https://developer.pixalate.com/products/enrichment-api)" (collectively, the “Services”), you agree that: (i) you have read and understood – and agree to be legally bound by – these Terms of Use (“Terms”); and (ii) Pixalate may make changes to these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time in its sole discretion, as described further in Section 40 (Modifications to these Terms) below. _(Note: Additional MRT features, functionality and insights are available on an annual subscription basis via separate agreement.)_

When accessing and using our Services, please note that you may be subject to other posted terms, conditions and guidelines applicable to certain services and/or content available on or via our Services. All terms, conditions and guidelines applicable to our Services, including our [Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pixalate.com/privacypolicy&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1621860688479000&usg=AOvVaw2C_zKk0sNbl5m5PpfqxCeG), are part of and incorporated into these Terms by this reference. With the exception of services governed by separate agreements executed between you and Pixalate (e.g., service orders and [Master Subscription Terms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://info.pixalate.com/legal&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1621860688480000&usg=AOvVaw19vS8q81bODmK2k3mb12Rm)), your access to and use of our Services is subject to these Terms. Accessing our Services in any manner, including through our APIs or via other automated means, constitutes your use of our Services and your agreement to be bound by these Terms.

Because these Terms are a legally binding agreement between you and Pixalate, please read them carefully. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you may not access or use our Services.

**2\. Electronic Communications.**  
  

When you use any of our Services, or send us emails, text messages, and other communications from your desktop, mobile device or other internet-connected system, you are communicating with us electronically. You hereby consent to receive communications from us electronically, such as e-mails, texts, mobile push notices, or notices and messages on or through the Services, and you may retain copies of these communications for your records. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

**3\. Disclosure Regarding Business Partner Qualification (“BPQ”) Policies.**

Our Services are intended to be accessed and used primarily by employees and representatives of organizations demonstrating a shared interest with Pixalate in protecting the digital advertising supply chain, especially as it relates to the detection and filtration of IVT. To maintain these standards, Pixalate conducts BPQ evaluations as part of our standard operating procedures, which are applicable to our prospective and existing clients. BPQ evaluations are intended to determine if a business relationship should be initiated or continued with each respective organization. Such procedures may result in your rights under these Terms terminating immediately and Pixalate taking steps as reasonably required to disable your access to and use of our Services.

Our BPQ process includes assessments of an organization’s legitimacy and intended use of IVT-related Materials (as defined below), including, among other considerations: (i) compliance with industry standards, including certifications or accreditations by the Trustworthy Accountability Group (“TAG”), Interactive Advertising Bureau (“IAB”), and/or Media Rating Council, Inc. (“MRC”); (ii) published third party data sources regarding the company; (iii) Pixalate’s general knowledge of the organization’s reputation in the digital advertising industry; (iv) relationships with suppliers or business partners; and (v) responses to our BPQ-related inquiries (both directly and via third party references). As noted above, our BPQ process is an ongoing assessment, and relationships, once formed, may be terminated by Pixalate at any time at our sole discretion.

**4\. Obligations in Connection with Our MRC Accreditations.**

As a company currently holding MRC accreditations in 17 distinct accreditation areas, we are required to, and do, adhere to the MRC’s Minimum Standards for Media Rating Research (“MRC Minimum Standards”), and applicable measurement guidelines as issued by the MRC, IAB, TAG, and the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA). If we determine, in our sole judgment, that your access to and/or use of our Services, or any services or content available on or via our Services, conflicts with any of our accreditation- or certification-related obligations, then your rights will terminate immediately and we may take all steps reasonably required to disable your access to and use our Services at our earliest opportunity.

**5\. Pixalate’s Proprietary Rights.**

You acknowledge and agree that our Services and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, reviews, information, data, software, reports, analytics, indices, blog postings, research, printed, audio or video presentations, documentation, other files, and the selection and arrangement thereof, used in connection with our Services (collectively, “Materials”) contain proprietary information that is protected by applicable intellectual property rights and other laws.

**6\. Copyright.**

All Materials included in or made available through our Services, as well as all compilations thereof, are the property of Pixalate, its affiliates or its content suppliers and protected by United States and international copyright laws.

**7\. Trademarks**.  
  

Pixalate, and all related graphics, logos, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names included in or made available through any Service are trademarks or trade dress of Pixalate or its affiliates, in the U.S. and other countries. Neither Pixalate's nor its affiliates' trademarks and trade dress may be used, in whole or in part, in connection with any product or service that is not Pixalate's or its affiliates', in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among clients or prospective clients, or in any manner that disparages or discredits Pixalate or its affiliates. All other trademarks not owned by Pixalate or its affiliates that appear in any Service are the property of their respective owners, who may or may not be affiliated with, connected to, or sponsored by Pixalate or its affiliates.

Failure to do so will constitute a breach of these Terms, which may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account. In addition, we reserve the right to refuse, suspend, or terminate your registration (or cancel a Pixalate User ID) for any reason and at our sole discretion.

From time to time, Pixalate's support staff may log into your account(s) in order to maintain or improve our service, including to provide you with assistance regarding technical issues.

You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to Your Materials; that you have the full right and authority to grant the rights and licenses granted to us herein with respect to Your Materials; and that the use of Your Materials by Pixalate and its affiliates will not infringe upon or violate the rights of any third party.

**14\. Websites and URLs Linked to or Referenced by the Service.  
**  

The internet changes constantly, and no technique can ever index all pages and Uniform Resource Locators (“URLs”) accessible thereon. In addition, Pixalate cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the websites, apps, apps stores, or other URLs to which the Services link or refer. Further, the process of including website and/or app content or URLs, app store content or URLs, or other third party content or URLs in the Services is largely automatic. Pixalate does not screen the content or URLs included in the Services, and these elements are maintained by persons over whom Pixalate exercises no control. For these reasons, Pixalate assumes no responsibility for the content of any website, app, app store or other URL included in the Services and is not responsible for errors or omissions or for offensive or objectionable content contained on any such elements included in the Services.

The following capitalized terms, when used herein, will have the corresponding meanings provided below:

* “**Fees**” means any amounts due and payable from you to us for purchases of Subscriptions hereunder.
* “**Subscription**” means the right to access and use certain Services offered hereunder for which we charge Fees. For example, under these Terms, we may offer you the right to make a certain number of API calls in exchange for a Fee.
* “**Taxes**” means any direct or indirect federal, state and/or local sales, use, excise, withholding, stamp or similar taxes and any duties, tariffs, levies and other similar governmental assessments or charges, but excluding income tax assessed against our actual or potential income.

If you purchase any Subscriptions to Services for which we charge Fees hereunder, unless otherwise specified at the time of purchase, all Fees are:

* payable in United States dollars, and
* exclusive of all Taxes now or hereafter levied against the provision of access to or use of such Services.

Taxes will be invoiced and collected by us if and to the extent required by any applicable taxing jurisdiction and you will bear ultimate financial responsibility for the payment of any such Taxes. All Fees payable under these Terms are non-refundable. We may change our Fees for Services offered hereunder at our discretion; provided however, that any such changes will not take effect for you until your next purchase.

With respect to our ATSAPI Services, please note the following:

* **Bank Charges:** The Service fees that we publish and charge are exclusive of any fees charged by your financial services vendors (e.g., foreign transaction fees) and your other service providers (e.g., cellular data plan fees; internet service provider fees);
* **Downgrades:** If you elect to downgrade your ATSAPI Service(s), such Service(s) will remain on the same tier until the end of the then-current cycle (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annual);
* **Cancellations:** If you elect to cancel your ATSAPI Service(s), there are no refunds; and you may continue to use such Service(s) until the end of the applicable cycle (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annual), and will continue to be charged applicable overage fees, if any;
* **Upgrades:** If you elect to upgrade your ATSAPI Service(s) during a service period, applicable fees for such Service(s) will be charged in accordance with the following example:
    * If you were to sign up for a $200 per month ATSAPI Service plan on the 1st day of the applicable month, and then you elect to upgrade to a $500 per month plan on the 15th day of such month, you would be charged a _pro rated_ amount of $350 (i.e., $200 - $100 + $500 - $250), instead of the newly applicable $500 per month fee;
* **Plan Changes:** We reserve the right to make ATSAPI plan changes at any time (e.g., tier names and/or pricing for one or more tiers, overage fees for one or more tier, features of one or more tiers), and such changes will take effect in the next billing cycle.

**19\. Modifications​ ​to​ our Services and/or any Materials.**

You agree that Pixalate shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of our Services, any portions thereof, or any Materials available on or via our Services. We may suspend, modify in any way, or cease providing you with access to any part (or all) of the Services or Materials at any time in our sole discretion without notice or liability to you or any third party.

**20\. Confidentiality**.  
  

“Confidential Information” means the information that we designate as confidential at the time of disclosure or that should reasonably be understood to be our confidential information, including all of our business information. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public through no act or omission by you or breach by you of these Terms; (ii) at the time of disclosure by us, was lawfully received by you from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to us or the source of such information; or (iii) was or is independently developed by you without use of or reference to the Confidential Information. Confidential Information disclosed prior to your acceptance of these Terms will be subject to this Section 20.

You will: (i) protect all Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure with at least the same degree of care that you use to protect your own similar confidential information, but not less than a reasonable standard of care; (ii) not use or disclose any Confidential Information for any purpose except to exercise your rights and/or fulfill your obligations under these Terms; and (iii) not disclose any Confidential Information to any person or entity other than your employees and/or contractors whose access is strictly necessary for purposes consistent with these Terms and who are bound by obligations of confidentiality no less stringent than those set forth herein.

You may disclose Confidential Information to comply with applicable law, provided that you give us prior notice (by sending an email to [legal@pixalate.com](mailto:legal@pixalate.com) or by sending a notice by postal mail or express delivery service to: Pixalate Europe Limited, 20 North Audley Street London, W1K 6WE, United Kingdom, Attn: Legal Affairs Department), of the compelled disclosure or legal proceeding (to the extent permitted by law) and reasonable assistance to and cooperation with us, at our cost, if we desire to contest the disclosure. You and we agree that money damages may be an inadequate remedy for breach of the obligations in this Section 20, and that any such breach may result in irreparable harm to us. Therefore, in the event of any such actual or threatened breach, we will be entitled, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to us at law or equity, to seek specific performance or injunctive relief without the posting of a bond.

**21\. Links and Widgets.  
**  

Our website may include links or widget links to other websites or to applications that we do not control. We are not responsible for the content, products or services available through these websites or applications, which are subject to their own terms of use and privacy policies. Such links and widgets are for your convenience and do not imply our endorsement. You release Pixalate from any damages that you may incur, and agree not to assert any claims against us, arising from your use of any third party websites or applications or from your purchase or use of third-party products and services.

**22\. No Guarantees.  
**  

The Material that appears on our Services is for general informational purposes only. Although we aim to provide a website that is useful, it is important to be mindful that our Services will, from time to time, contain errors. Our website includes Materials collected from and provided by third parties that we may not have evaluated or reviewed. We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of any of the Materials available on or via our Services, and you should not rely on such Materials without independent verification. We invite you to bring to our attention any Materials that you believe to be inaccurate. Please forward a copy of the Materials to our Legal Affairs Department via email tolegal@pixalate.com, or via mail to Pixalate Europe Limited, 20 North Audley Street London, W1K 6WE, United Kingdom, along with a reasonably detailed explanation of the inaccuracies; or call us at+44 (0)800 011 2050.

**23\.** **Your Responsibilities.**

The following capitalized terms, when used herein, will have the corresponding meanings provided below:

* “**COPPA**” means the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, a United States federal law, located at 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, 16 CFR Part 312, promulgated by the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) thereunder, including all amendments thereto.
* “**GDPR-K**” means, collectively, Article 8 and Recital 38 of the European Union (EU)’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
* “**Laws**” means all applicable national, state, provincial and/or local laws, regulations, rules, ordinances and other decrees of any governmental authority.

You are responsible for: (i) obtaining, provisioning, configuring, securing, maintaining and paying for all computer hardware, software, and communications equipment reasonably required to access and use Pixalate Materials governed by these Terms; and (ii) ensuring that you abide by all Laws applicable to your access to and use of such Pixalate Materials, including Laws designed to protect the privacy of children (e.g., COPPA, GDPR-K).

**24\. Pixalate’s Opinions.**

With respect to Pixalate's publisher trust indexes, seller trust indexes, mobile app trend pages, and any other website pages or Materials that present ratings and/or rankings for certain business entities, mobile or OTT/CTV apps, or other subject matter, the applicable categories, relative weightings thereof and other proprietary judgements reflect Pixalate's opinions with respect to factors that Pixalate believes will be of value to BPQ-qualified purchasers or sellers of digital advertising inventory, advertisers and/or agencies representing advertisers, and/or publishers of websites and/or apps (or competitive offerings thereto). The scores or ratings in each category reflect Pixalate’s opinions regarding the performance of each business entity, app, or other subject matter, as applicable, with respect to a particular category. The rankings reflect Pixalate's opinions regarding relative performance of each business entity, app or other subject matter, as applicable, with respect to the categories. Pixalate's opinions are just that – opinions, not facts or guarantees – but they are grounded in our proprietary technology and analytics, which we are continuously evaluating and updating.

With respect to any Pixalate compliance tools relating to COPPA (or any other children’s privacy-related regulation globally) that may be offered under these Terms, it is important to note that the mere fact that an app appears to be directed to children (e.g., data subjects under 13 years of age, as defined by COPPA), does not mean that any such app, or its operator, is failing to comply with COPPA. Further, with respect to apps that appear to be directed to children and have characteristics that, in Pixalate’s opinion, may trigger related privacy obligations and/or risk, such assertions reflect Pixalate’s opinions (i.e., they are neither facts nor guarantees); and, although Pixalate’s methodologies used to render such opinions are derived from automated processing, which at times is coupled with human intervention, no assurances can be – or are – given by Pixalate with respect to the accuracy of any such opinions.

**25\. Disclaimer of Warranties.  
**  

THE SERVICES MAY PROVIDE LINKS OR ACCESS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES, CONTENT, PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES (“THIRD PARTY MATERIALS”), WHICH MAY BE GOVERNED BY ONE OR MORE THIRD PARTIES’ TERMS OR CONDITIONS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR SUCH THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS; YOU BEAR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCESS TO AND/OR USE OF SUCH THIRD PARTY MATERIALS.

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, WE ARE NOT REGISTERED IN ANY INVESTMENT ADVISORY CAPACITY IN ANY JURISDICTION GLOBALLY, AND DO NOT OFFER ANY LEGAL, FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS ADVICE. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS, OR IN ANY OF OUR SERVICES, OR OTHER OFFERINGS, OR IN ANY MATERIALS PROVIDED BY US TO YOU OR OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US OR THROUGH THE SERVICES SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS AN OFFER, RECOMMENDATION, OR SOLICITATION TO BUY OR SELL ANY SECURITY OR INVESTMENT, OR TO MAKE ANY INVESTMENT DECISIONS. ANY REFERENCE TO PAST OR POTENTIAL PERFORMANCE IS NOT, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS, A RECOMMENDATION OR AS A GUARANTEE OF ANY SPECIFIC OUTCOME. YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CONSULT YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL, LEGAL, FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, AND BUSINESS ADVISORS.

**26\. Exclusions of Liability.  
**

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

**27\. Limitation of Liability.  
**  

PIXALATE'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS, OR ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED US$100. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 25 APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

**28\. Indemnification.**  
  

You hereby agree to defend Pixalate, and our directors, officers, employees, contractors, shareholders and agents (collectively, the ​“​Pixalate Indemnitees”​​) against any claims, actions, demands, proceedings and suits against any Pixalate Indemnitee (​“​Pixalate Indemnitee ​Claims”​ )​, and indemnify the Pixalate Indemnitees to the fullest extent of applicable law for all related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by such Pixalate Indemnitees arising out of any Pixalate Indemnitee Claims, to the extent such Pixalate Indemnitee Claims allege, arise out of, or otherwise relate to: (i) your breach of these Terms; (ii) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services or any Materials available on or via our Services; (iii) any content you have submitted to or through the Services; (iv) any dispute you have or may have with any third party; or (v) your violations of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with our Services or any Materials available on or via our Services. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any Pixalate Indemnitee Claims or other matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.

**29\. Force Majeure.  
**  

We shall not be liable for any delay in performance or failure to perform any of our obligations hereunder where such delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, pandemic, epidemic, viral outbreak or disease, or a failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services.

**30\. Assignment.  
**  

You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense your rights, liabilities, and/or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer, or delegate these Terms and any of our rights, liabilities, and/or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without your consent.

31\. Termination by You.

If you wish to terminate these Terms, you may do so at any time by no longer accessing or using our Services.

**32\. Suspension and Termination by Us.  
**  

You agree that we may, without prior notice to you: (i) terminate or suspend your use of and access to all or part of our Services for which you have not paid a subscription fee, (ii) suspend any Services for which you have paid a subscription fee for the following reasons: (a) a breach or violation or suspected breach or violation of these Terms, (b) a request by law enforcement or another government agency, (c) our decision to discontinue or change all or part of our Services, (d) technical or security issues, or (e) fraudulent or illegal activities. You agree that we may also terminate any Services for which you have paid a subscription fee with notice, effective the last day of your current billing cycle.

All terminations and suspension will be made in our sole discretion and you agree that we will not be liable for any termination of your use of or access to our Services or any Materials available on or via our Services.

**33\. Effects of Termination of these Terms.  
**  

Upon termination of these Terms: (i) your rights, and authorizations granted to you, to access and use the Services, Materials, and Confidential Information will terminate and you must immediately cease all access to and use of your Pixalate account(s), the Services, Materials, and Confidential Information; (ii) you must pay us any unpaid amount that was due or accrued prior to termination; and (iii) the following numbered Sections shall survive any termination of these Terms, together with any other terms and conditions that by their nature are reasonably intended to survive such termination: 1, 5 - 8, 10 - 14, 16, 18 -  30, 32 - 43.

**34\. Dispute Resolution and Mandatory Arbitration.  
**  

You and Pixalate agree that any claims or disputes (collectively, “Claims”) that arise out of or relate in any way to these Terms, our Services, or any Materials available on or via our Services, shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms as a court would.

**35\. Collective Legal Action Waiver.  
**  

You and Pixalate agree that all Claims will be resolved in an individual arbitration. Both you and Pixalate agree that there will be no group litigation – or other collective, class, representative, or consolidated actions – in arbitration. In addition, neither you nor Pixalate may participate in a group, collective, class or representative action in court as a class member if the Claims asserted in the litigation would fall within the scope of section 34 if asserted directly by you or Pixalate. To be clear, you and Pixalate both waive any right to participate in any group, collective, class or representative action involving disputes relating to these Terms. This collective legal action waiver is an essential part of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate and may not be severed. If for any reason this Section 35 is found unenforceable in relation to a Claim, Sections 34 - 37 will not apply to such Claim. However, the jury trial waiver set forth in Section 38 of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

**36\. Arbitrator Authority.  
**  

The arbitrator's authority is governed by these Terms. You and Pixalate agree that the arbitrator may award the same relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award – consistent with and limited by these Terms – but the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief that extends beyond you and your dealings with Pixalate. An arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party if a court of competent jurisdiction would be authorized to do so under applicable law.

**37\. Arbitration Procedures.  
**  

You and Pixalate agree that any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Pixalate shall be subject to arbitration in accordance with the UK Arbitration Act 1996. All arbitrations shall be conducted by the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) under its 2021 Arbitration Rules and Expedited Procedure Provisions. These rules and provisions are available on the ICC website at the following URL: https://iccwbo.org/dispute-resolution-services/arbitration/ or by email to info@iccwbo.uk. If there is a conflict between the ICC rules and these Terms, then these Terms shall control. Unless otherwise agreed by Pixalate in its sole discretion, you will be required to pay your portion of applicable filing fees and costs associated with commencing an arbitration, and you will be responsible for paying your own attorneys’ fees (if you chose to use an attorney in arbitration) unless you prevail in the arbitration and the arbitrator finds that you are entitled to recover your fees under applicable law. Except for Claims determined to be frivolous, Pixalate agrees not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.If you bring an arbitration against Pixalate, the arbitration hearing will be held in the city of London, England, unless we both agree on a different location. The parties shall maintain in perpetuity the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding (including the hearing) and award, unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

**38\. Jury Trial Waiver****.**  
  

You and Pixalate expressly and knowingly waive the right to trial by jury. This means that if for any reason Section 34 contained herein is not enforced or is found inapplicable, our Claims against each other will be resolved by a judge rather than a jury.

**39\. Applicable Law; Right to Seek Equitable Relief.  
**  

By using any Services, you agree that the laws of England and Wales will govern this agreement (including Pixalate’s Privacy Policy), without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.

**40\. Modifications to these Terms.  
**  

We may change these Terms from time to time and will revise the effective date when we do so. Your continued use of our Services after the posted effective date constitutes your agreement to be bound by these Terms, as modified, except that modifications will not apply to any dispute arising prior to their effective date.

Except as expressly provided in this Section 40, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of each party to these Terms. Disputes arising under or relating to these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of these Terms that was in effect at the time the dispute arose.

**41\. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.

**42\. Other.  
**  

You represent and warrant you will use the Services, Materials, and Confidential Information in compliance all U.K., U.S. and other export controls laws and that you are not located in a country subject to a U.K. or U.S. government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.K. and/or U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.K. or U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

**43\. General****.**  
  

These Terms and any applicable terms referenced herein are the entire agreement that governs your access to and use of the Services. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that portion shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect, and enforceable. For purposes of these Terms: (i) the words “include”, “includes”, and “including” will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”; (ii) the word “or” is used in the inclusive sense of “and/or” and the terms “or,” “any” and “either” are not exclusive; (iii) the words “herein” and “hereunder” refer to these Terms as a whole; (iv) headings are included for ease of reference only and shall not affect the construction; references to any person shall include natural persons and partnerships, firms and other incorporated bodies and all other legal persons of whatever kind and however constituted and their successors and permitted assigns or transferees; references to any statute, enactment, order, regulation or other legislative instrument shall be construed as a reference to the statute, enactment, order, regulation or instrument as amended, unless specifically indicated otherwise; and words used herein in the singular, where the context so permits, shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa.

Per the [MRC](http://www.mediaratingcouncil.org/063014%20Viewable%20Ad%20Impression%20Guideline_Final.pdf), “'Fraud' is not intended to represent fraud as defined in various laws, statutes and ordinances or as conventionally used in U.S. Court or other legal proceedings, but rather a custom definition strictly for advertising measurement purposes. Also per the [MRC](http://mediaratingcouncil.org/101515_IVT%20Addendum%20FINAL%20(Version%201.0).pdf), “‘Invalid Traffic’ is defined generally as traffic that does not meet certain ad serving quality or completeness criteria, or otherwise does not represent legitimate ad traffic that should be included in measurement counts. Among the reasons why ad traffic may be deemed invalid is it is a result of non-human traffic (spiders, bots, etc.), or activity designed to produce fraudulent traffic.”
