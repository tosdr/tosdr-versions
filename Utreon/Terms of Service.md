The Playeur Services are owned and operated by Playeur. Unless otherwise indicated, all content, information, and other materials on the Playeur Services (excluding User Content, set out in Section 8 below), including, without limitation, Playeur's trademarks and logos, the visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, software, computer code (including source code or object code), services, text, pictures, information, data, sound files, other files and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, the “Materials”) are protected by relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights and laws. All Materials contained on the Playeur Services are the property of Playeur or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and/or third-party licensors. Unless otherwise expressly stated in writing by Playeur, by agreeing to these Terms of Service you are granted a limited, non-sublicensable license (i.e. a personal and limited right) to access and use the Playeur Services for your personal use or internal business use only.

Playeur reserves all rights not expressly granted in these Terms of Service. This license is subject to these Terms of Service and does not permit you to engage in any of the following: (a) resale or commercial use of the Playeur Services or the Materials; (b) distribution, public performance or public display of any Materials; (c) modifying or otherwise making any derivative uses of the Playeur Services or the Materials, or any portion of them; (d) use of any data mining, robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods; (e) downloading (except page caching) of any portion of the Playeur Services, the Materials, or any information contained in them, except as expressly permitted on the Playeur Services; or (f) any use of the Playeur Services or the Materials except for their intended purposes. Any use of the Playeur Services or the Materials except as specifically authorized in these Terms of Service, without the prior written permission of Playeur, is strictly prohibited and may violate intellectual property rights or other laws. Unless explicitly stated in these Terms of Service, nothing in them shall be interpreted as conferring any license to intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel, implication or other legal principles. Playeur can terminate this license at any time, without notice, including where we reasonably consider that: (a) your use of the Playeur Services violates these Terms of Service or applicable law; (b) you fraudulently use or misuse the Playeur Services; or (c) we are unable to continue providing the Playeur Services to you due to technical or legitimate business reasons.

8\. User Content

Playeur allows users to distribute live and pre-recorded audio-visual works, to use services, such as chat, comments, forums, rule contributions, and to participate in other activities in which you may create, post, transmit, perform, or store content, messages, text, sound, images, applications, code or other data or materials on the Playeur Services (“User Content”).

### License to Playeur

You retain ownership of your User Content. We do however require that you grant Playeur and other users of the Playeur Services certain rights described below.

i. License to Playeur  
By providing User Content using the Playeur Services, you grant Playeur and its sublicensees a worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free, and transferable right to use that User Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it) in connection with the Playeur Services and Playeur's (and it's successors and affiliates') business for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Playeur Services.

ii. License to Other Users  
You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your User Content through the Playeur Services, and to use that User Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Playeur Services (such as video playback or embeds). Note that this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your User Content independent of the Service.

iii. Duration of License  
The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Playeur Services. You understand and agree, however, that Playeur may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted for up to a year.

iv. Removal of Your Content  
With respect to streaming live and pre-recorded audio-visual works, the rights granted by you hereunder terminate once you delete such User Content from the Playeur Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Playeur Services and others copied or stored portions of the User Content (e.g., made a Clip); (b) Playeur used it for promotional purposes; and (c) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.

### User Content Representations and Warranties

You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it. You represent, and warrant that: (1) you are the creator and owner of the User Content or otherwise have sufficient rights and authority to grant the rights granted herein; (2) your User Content does not and will not (a) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right or (b) defame any other person; (3) your User Content does not contain any viruses, adware, spyware, worms, or other harmful or malicious code; and (4) unless you have received prior written authorization, your User Content specifically does not contain any pre-release or non-public beta software or game content or any confidential information of Playeur or third parties. Playeur reserves all rights and remedies against any users who breach these representations and warranties.

### Content is Uploaded at Your Own Risk

Playeur uses reasonable security measures in order to attempt to protect User Content against unauthorized copying and distribution. However, Playeur does not guarantee that any unauthorized copying, use or distribution of User Content by third parties will not take place. To the furthest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby agree that Playeur shall not be liable for any unauthorized copying, use or distribution of User Content by third parties and release and forever waive any claims you may have against Playeur for any such unauthorized copying or usage of the User Content, under any theory. THE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT USER CONTENT USED BY Playeur HEREIN ARE PROVIDED AND USED “AS-IS” AND WITH NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, ASSURANCES OR OTHER TERMS THAT SUCH SECURITY MEASURES WILL WITHSTAND ATTEMPTS TO EVADE SECURITY MECHANISMS OR THAT THERE WILL BE NO CRACKS, DISABLEMENTS OR OTHER CIRCUMVENTION OF SUCH SECURITY MEASURES.

Content Creators may promote, administer, a voluntary paid subscription on, through or utilizing the Playeur Services (a “**Promotion**”).

(iii) Playeur is not responsible for and does not endorse or support any such Promotions. You may not indicate that Playeur is a sponsor or co-sponsor of the Promotion.

### Endorsements/Testimonials

You agree that your User Content will comply with the FTC’s [Guidelines Concerning the Use of Testimonials and Endorsements in Advertising](http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf), the [FTC’s .com Disclosures Guide](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/bus41-dot-com-disclosures-information-about-online-advertising.pdf) , the FTC’s [Native Advertising Guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/native-advertising-guide-businesses), and any other guidelines issued by the FTC from time to time (“FTC Guidelines”), as well as any other advertising guidelines required under applicable law. For example, if you have been paid or provided with free products in exchange for discussing or promoting a product or service through the Playeur Services, or if you are an employee of a company and you decide to discuss or promote that company’s products or services through the Playeur Services, you agree to comply with the FTC Guidelines’ requirements for disclosing such relationships.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (A) IN NO EVENT SHALL PLAYEUR OR THE PLAYEUR PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PLAYEUR SERVICES, THE CONTENT OR THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM RELIANCE BY USER ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM PLAYEUR, OR THAT RESULT FROM MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES OR EMAIL, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING FROM ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO PLAYEUR'S RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES; AND (B) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF PLAYEUR, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PLAYEUR SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THE PLAYEUR SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE CLAIM OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT PLAYEUR HAS OFFERED THE PLAYEUR SERVICES, USER CONTENT, MATERIALS AND OTHER CONTENT AND INFORMATION, SET ITS PRICES, AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND PLAYEUR, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND PLAYEUR. PLAYEUR WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PLAYEUR SERVICES TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

d. Applicable Law and Venue

(i) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Playeur agree that if you are a Subscribing Organization or a consumer resident of a jurisdiction other than those in (ii) below, the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH PLAYEUR AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM PLAYEUR.

You and Playeur agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Service or your use of the Playeur Services, except that you and Playeur are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Playeur agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Playeur shall be sent to Playeur, Inc., Attn: Legal, 2810 N Church St, PMB 44417, Wilmington, DE, 19802. You and Playeur further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in New York County, New York; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and that the state or federal courts in New York County, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of New York and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Playeur will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.

(ii) If you are a resident in any jurisdiction in which the provision in the section above is found to be unenforceable, then the following shall apply:

Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service will be governed by and construed under the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence. 

Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by competent civil courts within your jurisdiction of residence.

e.  Claims

YOU AND PLAYEUR AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE PLAYEUR SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

16\. Miscellaneous
------------------

a. Waiver

If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service, it will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by the relevant party.

b. Severability

If any provision of these Terms of Service or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms of Service to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

c. Assignment

These Terms of Service and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Playeur without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Terms of Service shall be void.

d. Survival

Upon termination of these Terms of Service, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 7, 8, 11, 12, and 15-17.

e. Entire Agreement

The Terms of Service, together with the Terms of Sale, the Privacy Policy and the Guidelines, is the entire agreement between you and Playeur relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except in writing, signed or otherwise agreed to by both parties, or by a change to these Terms of Service or Guidelines made by Playeur as set forth in Section 6 above.

17\. Requests for Information and How to Serve a Subpoena
