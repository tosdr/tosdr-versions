Privacy Policy
==============

We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us. 

That’s the basic purpose of this Privacy Policy.

**You should read this policy in full, but here are a few key things we hope you take away from it:**

Playeur is public and media is immediately viewable and searchable by anyone around the world. We give you non-public ways to communicate on Playeur too, through protected Direct Messages. You can also use Playeur under a pseudonym if you prefer not to use your name.

When you use Playeur, even if you’re just looking at media, we receive some personal information from you like the type of device you’re using and your IP address. You can choose to share additional information with us like your email address, phone number, address book contacts, and a public profile. We use this information for things like keeping your account secure and showing you more relevant videos, people to follow, and ads.

We give you control through your [settings](https://playeur.com/settings) to limit the data we collect from you and how we use it, and to control things like account security, marketing preferences.

In addition to information you share with us, we use your videos you’ve viewed, Liked, or Reposted, and other information to determine what channels you’re interested in, your age, the languages you speak, and other signals to show you more relevant content. We give you transparency into that information, and you can modify or correct it at any time.

If you have questions about this policy, how we collect or process your personal data, or anything else related to our privacy practices, we want to hear from you. You can [contact us](https://help.playeur.com/en/support/tickets/new) at any time.

If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) to link your Playeur account with a third-party service, you are requesting and authorizing us to share or grant access to information on your behalf (such as your username, the fact that your connection originated from the Playeur Services, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party.

### Advertisers and Analytics Providers

Playeur may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the Playeur Services. These service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the Playeur Services. The information collected (described above in “Automatically Collected Information”) may be shared with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Playeur Services.

Playeur may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and  advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Playeur Services. We may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).

Playeur recognizes browser-initiated GPC signals.

Playeur uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information. These measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information. However, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Playeur, and you do so at your own risk. We cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

### Children’s Privacy

IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS PLAYEUR AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER WITHOUT PARENTAL SUPERVISION. 

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Playeur does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Playeur learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Playeur Services, Playeur will take appropriate steps to delete this information.

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Playeur Services member, then please contact playeur at [privacy@playeur.com](mailto:privacy@playeur.com) to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.

For residents of the EEA, where processing of personal information is based on consent, Playeur will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law. If we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.

### Merger or Sale

In the event that Playeur, or some or all assets related to the Playeur Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.

### International Data Transfers

Information collected by Playeur may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Playeur or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.  If we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.

### Changes and Updates to this Privacy Notice

Playeur reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Playeur Services or to reflect changes in the law). Please check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes. Your continued use of the Playeur Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.
