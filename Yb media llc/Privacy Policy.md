You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g. user name, e-mail address) via forums, postings, profiles or other areas of the Service, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected, correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of YB Media. Please do not post any personal information on the Service or in other areas that you expect to keep private. You may modify personal information that you have submitted using the Service by accessing the Service and updating your profile information.

Opting Out. If you wish for us remove all of your personal information, please contact [privacy@yardbarker.com](mailto:privacy@yardbarker.com).

How Long Do We Keep Your Information?

We still store your information as long as necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, unless you specifically edit it, or opt out (as described above). We may also retain information required by law.

Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies for interest-based advertising, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

Third-Party Links and Referrals

For your convenience, we may provide links to certain third party websites or referrals to certain third parties' products or services. If you choose to visit a third party's website or use its products or services, please be aware that the third party's privacy policy, and not the YB Media privacy policy, will govern your activities and any information you disclose while interacting with the third party.

Security Practices

Because any personally identifiable information you submit to YB Media is purely voluntary and should not be of a particularly sensitive nature, we employ standard security measures with respect to this information and do not use special encryption methods at this time. User accounts are secured by user-created passwords.

Please note that no method of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. As such, we cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.

It is your responsibility to take appropriate steps to protect against unauthorized access to your computer or mobile device. We are not responsible for any lost or stolen computers, phones, or other devices, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized access.

Children's Guidelines

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information relating to children. In the event that we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age without prior parental consent, we will take steps to promptly delete such information. By providing your personal information to us or through the Service, you represent that you are 13 years of age or older.

Policy Changes

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy, and will post any revisions on the Service. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of the Service will be subject to the then-current privacy policy.

International Visitors and Users

The Service is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union (EU) or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by providing your personal data you consent to:

1. The use of your personal data for the purposes identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and
2. The transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.

No Error-Free Performance

We do not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. We may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. Accordingly, we welcome your feedback regarding any privacy concerns that you may have, including how we can improve this Privacy Policy. You can provide feedback at [privacy@yardbarker.com](mailto:privacy@yardbarker.com). We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with it.
