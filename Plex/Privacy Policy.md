### **What information does Plex collect from my Plex Media Server?**

Plex understands that you have personal content that you store using the Plex Media Server software (“Personal Content”).

Plex collects the following Personal Data from your Plex Media Server: email, IP address and username.

Plex does **NOT** share information about your Personal Content with third parties.

Plex does **NOT** collect:

* Content titles of your Personal Content.
* Filenames **EXCEPT** those that may be collected through optional [crash reports](https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/#you-have-the-right-to-limit-what-activity-data-is-sent-from-your-plex-media-server).
* Metadata for Personal Content (e.g., information about the specific file, cover art, subtitles, running length, etc.) **EXCEPT** to customize viewed content syncing to enhance your account or if you have enabled metadata matching capabilities in which case such data will be anonymously sent to us or you have integrated with a third-party control or playback mechanism that requires us to access your metadata to play the relevant content (e.g., if you use Amazon Alexa to play a particular song or movie from your Personal Content, then our Services may search your Personal Content metadata in order to find and play the song or movie requested.)
* Data transferred through the Plex Relay Service. If you use the Plex Relay Service to connect or stream your Personal Content to another device, we will transfer the data necessary to perform the service. All such traffic is encrypted from end-to-end in a manner that makes it impossible for Plex or the Plex Relay Service to decrypt or view any data. The data transferred via the Plex Relay Service is not stored by Plex except for the temporary buffering of data required to provide you with an optimal streaming experience. You can disable the Plex Relay Service by turning off the “Enable Relay” preference in the “Network” section of your [Plex Media Server Settings](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/account)**.**

Plex does collect:

* Configuration data. Information about your configuration or use of our Services when you create a Plex Media Server on a local device, connect to a Plex Media Server that you or another person have configured, or download or connect to a Plex app, or interact with or use other Plex software or Service. This information may include an IP address, the number of files, and information used to secure access to our Services.
* Activity data. Information about your activity as described in “[What information does Plex collect about my activity on the Services?](https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/#what-information-does-plex-collect-about-my-activity-on-the-services)”
