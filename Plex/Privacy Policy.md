### **M. What information does Plex collect from my Plex Media Server?**

Plex understands that you have personal content that you store using the Plex Media Server software (“Personal Content”). 

Plex collects the following Personal Data from your Plex Media Server: email, IP address and username. 

Plex does **not** share information about your Personal Content with third parties. 

Plex does **not** collect:

* Content titles of your Personal Content.
* Filenames **EXCEPT** those that may be collected under Debugging Information below.
* Metadata for Personal Content (e.g., information about the specific file, cover art, subtitles, running length, etc.) **EXCEPT** to customize viewed content syncing to enhance your account or if you have enabled metadata matching capabilities in which case such data will be anonymously sent to us or you have integrated with a third-party control or playback mechanism that requires us to access your metadata to play the relevant content (e.g., if you use Amazon Alexa to play a particular song or movie from your Personal Content, then our Services may search your Personal Content metadata in order to find and play the song or movie requested.) 
* Data transferred through the Plex Relay Service. If you use the Plex Relay Service to connect or stream your Personal Content to another device, we will transfer the data necessary to perform the service. All such traffic is encrypted from end-to-end in a manner that makes it impossible for Plex or the Plex Relay Service to decrypt or view any data. The data transferred via the Plex Relay Service is not stored by Plex except for the temporary buffering of data required to provide you with an optimal streaming experience. **You can disable the Plex Relay Service by turning off the “Enable Relay” preference in your server settings**.

Plex does collect:

* Configuration data. Information about your configuration or use of our Services when you create a Plex Media Server on a local device, connect to a Plex Media Server that you or another person have configured, or download or connect to a Plex app, or interact with or use other Plex software or Service. This information may include an IP address and port number(s), the name of a Plex Media Server, and information used to secure access to our Services
* Application Information. When a request for information or content is sent to a Plex Media Server, we may collect an application identifier that identifies which application sent the request. An application identifier uniquely identifies a particular copy of an application. For example, if you download an application from Plex, fully uninstall the copy of the application, and then re-download the application from Plex, the new copy of the application will be associated with a different application identifier than the uninstalled copy of the application. Note that simply deleting the app without fully uninstalling may not reset the application identifier.
* Debugging Information (logs, crash reports, or other information about your devices, media, and experiences for the sole purpose of resolving technical issues with the software). You may choose not to send crash reports in Plex Media Server settings.
* Usage Statistics.Information related to your usage to run and improve our Services, to provide, customize, and personalize your features and account, communications, and other content that we deliver or offer to you.
