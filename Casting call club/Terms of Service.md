If your debit card, credit card, or other payment information ("Payment Information") is declined for payment of your subscription, you must provide new Payment Information or your subscription will be canceled. If you provide new Payment Information and are successfully charged, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge. You may cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period and the cancellation will take effect on the next billing period. Your subscription will remain active from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period, and you will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period.

UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR DO NOT WANT TO AUTO RENEW, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION.

20\. VIRTUAL GOODS

CCC does not guarantee that the Virtual Goods will continually be offered, including cccCoins or awards such as Silver, Gold or Bronze or for any particular length of time. CCC may modify its Virtual Goods at its sole discretion, and such modifications may make some or all Virtual Goods more or less common, desirable, effective, or functional. CCC may immediately suspend or terminate Virtual Goods for any or no reason, in its sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability. The number of Virtual Goods required to use other Virtual Goods (e.g., cccCoins needed to award another user) may be increased or decreased, any Virtual Good may be withdrawn, and restrictions on any Virtual Good redemption may be imposed at any time, even though such changes may affect the value or utility of the Virtual Good, or the ability to obtain certain Virtual Goods. In accumulating Virtual Goods, users may not rely upon the continued availability of any Virtual Goods.

Virtual Goods have no monetary value (i.e., are not a cash account or equivalent), and do not constitute currency or property of any type. Virtual Goods cannot be sold to other users, and cannot be exchanged for cash or for any other goods and services. Users have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, or monetary interest in promotional or purchased Virtual Goods, which remain CCC digital content subject to the CCC’s User Agreement. Virtual Goods are non-refundable. Virtual Goods awarded to other users will not be returned (e.g., if you award another user, you cannot take that award back). You may not sell, barter, or trade any Virtual Goods, or offer to sell or trade any Virtual Goods. Any such attempted transfer will be null and void.

21\. ADULT CONTENT

No pornographic content of any kind. Sorry. We kept getting legal notices.
