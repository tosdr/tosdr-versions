Privacy policy
==============

### Who are we and what do we do?

FundApps (“**FundApps**”, “**we**”, “**our**” or “**us**”) has developed and owns a cloud hosted SaaS platform that enables businesses to monitor and report on their compliance with regulatory requirements (**Services**).

This privacy policy gives you information about how we collect, store, use, disclose and process and uses your personal data through:

1. your use and visitation of [_fundapps.co_](https://www.fundapps.co/) and other FundApps websites (**Websites**); and
2. your use of our Services as a client or
3. an employee of a client.

The Websites and Services are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.

Please note that this privacy policy does not cover our practices regarding prospective candidates or job applicants. Please visit [_https://www.fundapps.co/candidate-privacy-policy_](https://www.fundapps.co/candidate-privacy-policy) which describes our practices relating to such personal data processing.

### Contact details

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, please contact our legal counsel who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy policy by email on [_privacy@fundapps.co_](mailto:privacy@fundapps.co)_._

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the relevant regulator for data protection issues (such as the ICO in the UK). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach a regulator so please contact us in the first instance.

### Changes to the privacy policy and your duty to inform us of changes

We keep our privacy policy under regular review. This version was last updated in April 2024. It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.

### Third-party links

The Websites may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our Websites, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

##### 1\. The types of personal data we collect about you and where we get it from

The personal information we process about you broadly falls into four main categories: (i) Contact Information; (ii) Service and Billing Information; (iii) Browsing and Device Usage Information; and (iv) Marketing Preferences.

We collect your personal information from various sources. The table below sets out the different types of personal information that we collect and the sources we collect it from.

|     |     |     |

We also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data which is not personal data as it does not directly (or indirectly) reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate individuals' Browsing and Device Usage Information to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature in order to analyse general trends in how users are interacting with our Websites and using our Services to help improve the website and our service offering.

We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

**If you fail to provide personal data**

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with the Services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

services and offers may be of interest to you so that we can then send you relevant marketing   
communications.

We will get your express consent before we share your personal data with any third party for their own direct marketing purposes.

**Opting out of marketing** 

You can ask to stop sending you marketing communications at any time by following the opt-out links  within any marketing communication sent to you or by contacting us at marketing@fundapps.co. 

If you opt out of receiving marketing communications, you will still receive service-related communications that are essential for administrative or customer service purposes.

**Cookies** 

When you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of  cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to   
make the site work as you expect it to. 

The information does not usually directly identify you, but it can give you a more personalised web  experience. Because we respect your right to privacy, you can choose not to allow some types of cookies using the “Accept” or “Decline” our use of cookies that are not strictly necessary. However, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the Websites and the Services we are able to offer.

You can also manage and control the use of cookies through your browser, including removing cookies by deleting them from your browser history when you leave our Websites. You can also opt out of being tracked by [Google Analytics](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) [](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)across all websites. 

We use the following cookies:

* **Strictly necessary cookies.** These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Websites   
    and cannot be switched off. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which   
    amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in   
    forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the   
    Websites will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
* **Analytical or performance cookies.** These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors   
    and to see how visitors move around our Websites when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Websites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our Websites and will not be able to monitor their performance.
* **Functionality cookies.** These are used to recognise you when you return to our Websites. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* **Targeting cookies.** These cookies record your visit to our Websites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We or our advertising partners may then use this information to make our Websites and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

* Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets.  Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal information in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

##### 4\. International transfers

We will transfer the personal information we collect about you inside of and transfer between the USA, UK and Singapore where our Internal Third Parties are located in order to perform our contract with you. Such transfers are governed by an intragroup arrangement that contains specific standard   
contractual terms approved for use in the UK, USA and Singapore which give the transferred personal data the same protection as it has in its originating jurisdiction.

We may transfer your personal data to External Third Parties that carry out certain functions on our behalf. This may involve transferring personal data outside of your home jurisdiction to countries which have laws that do not provide the same level of data protection as the laws of your home jurisdiction. Whenever we undertake such transfers, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to you by  ensuring that the following safeguards are implemented: 

* We conduct enhanced due diligence on all External Third Parties which includes a full security   
    and legal review prior to onboarding them.
* We only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed by the EU (pursuant to article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679) to provide an adequate level of protection for  personal data, namely, the UK under GDPR and the United States (for organisations   
    participating in the EU-US and UK extension of the Data Privacy Framework).
    * We use specific standard contractual terms approved for use in the UK and EU which give   
        the transferred personal data the same protection as it has in the UK and EU, namely the   
        EU Standard Contractual Clauses, the International Data Transfer Agreement or the   
        International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU SCCs for international data transfers.
    * We will conduct transfer risk assessments and data protection impact assessments where   
        applicable to identify and minimise any risks associated with such third-party processing   
        and transferring any personal data.
    * We shall remain responsible for the acts and omission of any External Third Parties as if   
        they were our acts and omissions

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of your home jurisdiction.

##### 5\. Data security

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We are ISO27001 certified and comply with SOC 2 – further details on our security processes can be found [here.](https://fundapps.co/security)

##### 6\. Data retention

**How long will you use my personal data for?**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact Information and Service and Billing Information) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.Otherwise, we will retain all other personal data for the length of our contractual agreement with you or until such time as we receive a deletion request.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see section 7 for further information.

##### 7\. Your legal rights

Under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, you have the right to:

* **Request access to your personal data** (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
* **Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you**. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
* **Request erasure of your personal data in certain circumstances.** This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
* **Object to processing of your personal data** where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data (including carrying out profiling based on our legitimate interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your right to object. You also have the absolute right to object any time to the processing of your personal   
    data for direct marketing purposes (see OPTING OUT OF MARKETING for details of how to do so).
* **Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.** We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
* **Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data**. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide our Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
* **Request restriction of processing of your personal data.** This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in one of the following scenarios:
    * If you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
    * Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
    * Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
    * You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact [privacy@fundapps.co.](mailto:privacy@fundapps.co) 

**No fee usually required**

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
