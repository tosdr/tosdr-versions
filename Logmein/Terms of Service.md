**[Back to Legal](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal)**

TERMS OF SERVICE
================

This is a legal agreement between the person or organization (“**Customer**” or “**you**”) agreeing to these Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) and the applicable contracting entities at [https://www.goto.com/company/legal/contracting-entities](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/contracting-entities) (“**GoTo**,” “**us**,” or “**we**”). By accepting these Terms, signing an Order, or using the Services, you represent that you are of legal age and have the authority to bind the Customer to: (i) the Order; (ii) these Terms; (iii) the "**Service Descriptions**" available at [https://www.goto.com/company/legal/service-descriptions](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/service-descriptions); (iv) the country-specific "**Regional Supplement**" available at [https://www.goto.com/company/legal/regional-supplement](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/regional-supplement), if any; and (v) the Professional Services Terms and Conditions available at [https://www.goto.com/company/legal/professional-services-terms](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/professional-services-terms), in each case, as applicable (collectively the “**Agreement**”). You further confirm that you have obtained all necessary approvals to enter this Agreement, including for example ratification by your governing board or other relevant authority(ies), or as required by law or your internal policies.

1. 1\. **ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICES.**
    * 1.1. **Right to Use Services.** You agree to use the Services in accordance with the use levels by which we measure, price, and offer our Services as posted on our websites, your Order, or the Service Descriptions (“**Use Levels**”). You may use our Services only as permitted in these Terms, and you acknowledge our Privacy Policy at [https://www.goto.com/company/legal/privacy](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/privacy), which is incorporated by reference. We grant you a limited right to use our Services only for business and professional purposes. Technical support for the Services is described in the Service Descriptions. If your affiliates use our Services, you warrant that you have the authority to bind those affiliates and you will be liable if your affiliates do not comply with the Agreement. “**Service(s)**” means our software-as-a-service offerings and our audio services (including any related hardware, which are offered by GoTo Technologies Ireland Unlimited Company, GoTo Audio, LLC, Grasshopper Group LLC, or GoTo Communications, Inc., or their subsidiaries, our telecommunications providers responsible for the rates and terms relating to the respective audio services). The Service Descriptions are incorporated into these Terms.
    * 1.2.**Limitations on Use.** By using our Services, you agree on behalf of yourself, your users and your attendees, not to (i) modify, prepare derivative works of, or reverse engineer, our Services; (ii) knowingly or negligently use our Services in a way that abuses or disrupts our networks, user accounts, or the Services; (iii) transmit through the Services any harassing, indecent, obscene, or unlawful material; (iv) market, or resell the Services to any third party; (v) use the Services in violation of applicable laws, or regulations; (vi) use the Services to send unauthorized advertising, or spam; (vii) harvest, collect, or gather user data without their consent; (viii) transmit through the Services any material that may infringe the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of third parties; (ix) use the Services to commit fraud or impersonate any person or entity; or (x) engage in any form of penetration testing, including but not limited to network scanning, vulnerability scanning, or other methods designed to identify vulnerabilities within the Services.
    * 1.3. **Changes to Services.** We reserve the right to enhance, upgrade, improve, or modify features of our Services as we deem appropriate and in our discretion. We will not materially reduce the core functionality (as set forth in the [Service Descriptions](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/service-descriptions)) or discontinue any Services unless we provide you with prior written notice. We may offer additional functionality to our standard Services or premium feature improvements for an additional cost.
    * 1.4. **Proprietary Rights and GoTo Marks.** You acknowledge that we or our licensors retain all proprietary right, title and interest in the Services, our name, logo or other marks (together, the “**GoTo Marks**”), and any related intellectual property rights, including, without limitation, all modifications, enhancements, derivative works, and upgrades thereto. You agree that you will not use or register any trademark, service mark, business name, domain name or social media account name or handle which incorporates in whole or in part the GoTo Marks or is similar to any of these. You agree to comply with our Branding Guidelines, available at [https://www.goto.com/company/legal/trademark](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/trademark), which are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
2. 2\. **ORDERS, FEES AND PAYMENT.**
    * 2.1. **Orders.** You may order Services using our then-current ordering processes (“**Order**”). All Orders are effective on the earlier of (i) the date you submit your Order, or (ii) the date on the signature block of the Order (“**Effective Date**”). Acceptance of your Order may be subject to our verification and credit approval process. Each Order shall be treated as a separate and independent Order. A Purchase Order is required for non-credit card transactions over 25,000 USD, or equivalent, unless Customer does not require a Purchase Order as part of its purchasing process.
    * 2.2. **Fees and Payment.** You agree to pay all applicable, undisputed fees for the Services on the terms set forth in this Agreement or your invoice. Except as set forth in Section 3.3 below or in the Service Descriptions, any and all payments you make to us for access to the Services are final and non-refundable. You are responsible for all fees and charges you incur to your other service providers (e.g. your broadband and internet provider) in connection with your use of the Services. You are responsible for providing accurate and current billing, contact and payment information to us or any reseller. You agree that we may charge any of your payment methods on file with us or bill you for all amounts due for your Services subscription, and we may take steps to update your payment card information (where permitted) to ensure that payment can be processed. You agree that your credit card information and related personal data may be provided to third parties for payment processing and fraud prevention purposes. We may, where permitted by applicable law, suspend or terminate your Services if at any time we determine that your payment information is inaccurate or not current, and you are responsible for fees and overdraft charges that we may incur when we charge your card for payment. We will not agree to submit invoices via any customer procure-to-pay online portal or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) portals. We reserve the right to update the price for Services at any time after your Initial Term, and price changes will be effective as of your next billing cycle. In accordance with applicable law, we will notify you in a timely manner of any price changes by publishing on our website, emailing, quoting, or invoicing you.
    * 2.3. **Sales, Promotional Offers, Coupons and Pricing.** Sales, promotions and other special discounted pricing offers are temporary and, upon the renewal of your subscription, any such discounted pricing offers may expire. We reserve the right to discontinue or modify any coupons, credits, sales, and special promotional offers in our sole discretion.
    * 2.4. **Disputes; Delinquent Accounts.** You must notify us of any fee dispute within 15 days of the invoice date, and once resolved, you agree to pay those fees within 15 days. We may, on notice to you, suspend or terminate your Services if you do not pay undisputed fees, and you agree to reimburse us for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in collecting undisputed delinquent amounts.
    * 2.5. **Taxes and Withholding.** You are responsible for all applicable sales, services, value-added, goods and services, withholding, tariffs, Universal Services Fund (USF) fees or any other similar fees as may be applicable in the location in which the Services are being provided (if applicable to the Audio Services only) and similar taxes or fees (collectively, “**Taxes and Fees**”) imposed by any government entity or collecting agency based on the Services, except those Taxes and Fees based on our net income, or Taxes and Fees for which you have provided an exemption certificate. In all cases, you will pay the amounts due under this Agreement to us in full without any right of set-off or deduction.
3. 3\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**
    * 3.1. **Term.** The initial term commitment for your purchase of Services will be as specified on an Order (“Initial Term”) and begins on the Effective Date. After the Initial Term, the Services will automatically renew for subsequent terms ("Renewal Terms"), unless otherwise specified in an Order or the [Service Description](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/service-descriptions) for a particular Service, or unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the current term expires. Each Renewal Term will be equivalent in length to the then-expiring subscription term, unless otherwise specified by GoTo at the time of renewal. You may provide notice of non-renewal for each Service you do not wish to renew at [https://support.goto.com/contactus](https://support.goto.com/contactus). We may agree to align the invoicing under multiple Orders, but this will not reduce the term of any Order. Terminating specific Services does not affect the term of any other Services still in effect. If we permit you to reinstate Services at any time after termination, you agree that you will be bound by the then-current Terms and the renewal date that was in effect as of the effective termination date.
    * 3.2. **Termination for Cause.** Either party may terminate the Agreement (i) if the other party breaches its material obligations and fails to cure within 30 days of receipt of written notice, or (ii) where permitted by applicable law, if the other party becomes insolvent or bankrupt, liquidated or is dissolved, or ceases substantially all of its business, and we may suspend access or terminate immediately if you breach Section 1.2, 4.1, 4.3, or 5.
    * 3.3. **Effect of Termination.** If the Agreement or any Services are terminated, your account may be converted to a “free” or “basic” version of the Service, if available, at our discretion. Otherwise, you will immediately discontinue all use of the terminated Services, except that upon request, we will provide you with limited access to the Services for a period not to exceed 30 days, solely to enable you to retrieve your Content from the Services. We have no obligation to maintain your Content after that period. To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither party will be liable for any damages resulting from termination of the Agreement, and termination will not affect any claim arising prior to the effective termination date. If we discontinue Services or materially reduce the core functionality in accordance with Section 1.3 above, the related Order will be terminated, and we will provide you with a pro rata refund of any prepaid, unused fees. You agree to pay for any use of the Services past the date of expiration or termination which have not been converted to a free version of the Service.
    * 3.4. **Survival.** The provisions of Sections 2 (Orders, Fees and Payment), 3.3 (Effect of Termination), 4 (Your Content and Accounts), 7 (Indemnification), 8 (Limitation on Liability), 9.5 (No Class Actions), 9.10 (Notices), and 9.14 (Contracting Party, Choice of Law and Location for Resolving Disputes) survive any termination of the Agreement.
4. 4\. **YOUR CONTENT AND ACCOUNTS.**
    * 4.1. **Your Content.** You retain all rights to your Content (defined below) and we do not own or license your Content. We may use, modify, reproduce, and distribute your Content in order to provide and operate the Services. You warrant that (i) you have the right to upload or otherwise share Content with us, and (ii) your uploading or processing of your Content in the context of our Services does not infringe on any rights of any third party. Each party agrees to apply reasonable technical, organizational, and administrative security measures to keep Content protected in accordance with industry standards. We will not view, access or process any of your Content, except: (x) as authorized or instructed by you or your users in this Agreement or in any other agreement between the parties, or (y) as required to comply with our policies, applicable law, or governmental request. “**Content**” means any files, documents, recordings, chat logs, transcripts, and similar data that we maintain on your or your users’ behalf, as well as any other information you or your users may upload to your Service account in connection with the Services.
    * 4.2. **Your Privacy and Security.** We maintain a global privacy and security program designed to protect your Content and any associated personal data we may collect and/or process on your behalf. You understand that your personal data may be processed in connection with your use of our Services, software, and websites which are provided via equipment and resources located in the United States and other locations throughout the world. Data processing information is set forth in more detail on our Trust & Privacy Center ([https://www.goto.com/company/trust](https://www.logmein.com/company/trust)) where you can review applicable data processing locations and Sub-Processor Disclosures, as well as Service-specific information about our technical and organizational security measures (located in the Technical and Organizational Measures  or "TOMs" documentation). When providing our Services, we act as a data processor, service provider, or the equivalent construct. To review and execute our Data Processing Addendum ("**DPA**"), please visit [https://www.goto.com/company/legal](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal).
    * 4.3. **Your Accounts.** You are solely responsible for (i) all use of the Services by you and your users, (ii) maintaining lawful basis for the collection, use, processing and transfer of Content, and (iii) providing notices or obtaining consent as legally required in connection with the Services. We do not send emails asking for your usernames or passwords, and to keep your accounts secure, you should keep all usernames and passwords confidential. We are not liable for any loss that you may incur if a third party uses your password or account. We may suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement if you, your users, or attendees are using the Services in a manner that is likely to cause harm to us or if we have reasonable grounds for suspecting any illegal, fraudulent, or abusive activity on your part. You agree to notify us immediately and terminate any unauthorized access to the Services or other security breach.
5. 5\. **COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.** In connection with the performance, access and use of the Services under the Agreement, each party agrees to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations including, but not limited to export, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations. Each party represents that it is not named on any U.S. government denied-party list. Further, Customer shall not permit its users to access or use any Service or Content in a U.S. embargoed country or in violation of any U.S. export law or regulation. If necessary and in accordance with applicable law, we will cooperate with local, state, federal and international government authorities with respect to the Services. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms, we may immediately terminate the Agreement for noncompliance with applicable laws.
6. 6\. **WARRANTIES.** WE WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL CONFORM TO THE SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS UNDER NORMAL USE. WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT (i) THE USE OF OUR SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR OPERATE IN COMBINATION WITH ANY SPECIFIC HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM OR DATA, (ii) OUR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR (iii) ALL ERRORS OR DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS WARRANTY WILL BE, AT OUR SOLE OPTION AND SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, TO PROVIDE CONFORMING SERVICES, OR TO TERMINATE THE NON-CONFORMING SERVICES OR THE APPLICABLE ORDER, AND PROVIDE A PRO-RATED REFUND OF ANY PREPAID FEES FROM THE DATE YOU NOTIFY US OF THE NON-CONFORMANCE THROUGH THE END OF THE REMAINING TERM. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

    * 9.12. **Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence.** The Agreement, including any applicable DPA, sets forth the entire agreement between you and GoTo relating to the Services and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written agreements, except as otherwise permitted. If there is a conflict between an executed Order, a country-specific Regional Supplement, these Terms, the DPA, and the Service Descriptions, in each case, as applicable, the conflict will be resolved in that order, but only for the specific Services described in the applicable Order. Nothing contained in any document submitted by you will add to or otherwise modify the Agreement. We may update the Terms from time to time, which will be identified by the last updated date, and may be reviewed at[https://www.goto.com/company/legal/terms-and-conditions](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/terms-and-conditions).

No person or entity not a party to the Agreement will be a third-party beneficiary. Our authorized distributors do not have the right to modify the Agreement or to make commitments binding on us. Failure to enforce any right under the Agreement will not waive that right. Unless otherwise specified, remedies are cumulative. The Agreement may be agreed to online or executed by electronic signature and in one or more counterparts. No party will be responsible for any delay or failure to perform under the Agreement due to force majeure events (e.g. natural disasters; terrorist activities, activities of third-party service providers, labor disputes; and acts of government) and acts beyond a party’s reasonable control, but only for so long as those conditions persist.
    * 9.14. **Contracting Party, Choice of Law and Location for Resolving Disputes.** The GoTo contracting entity, contact information, and governing law for your use of the Services will depend on where you are and the specific Services you have ordered, as set forth here: [https://www.goto.com/company/legal/contracting-entities](https://www.logmein.com/company/legal/contracting-entities).
