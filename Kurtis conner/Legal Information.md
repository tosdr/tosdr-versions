Data Privacy Notice
===================

### Data Privacy Notice

We are ELEVENTYFOUR LP d/b/a SANDBAG USA with address 1320 s. Main Street, #30, Los Angeles, CA 90015. Our Data Protection Lead can be contacted at dataprotection@sandbaguk.com. We have produced this privacy notice in order to keep you informed of how we handle your personal data. All handling of your personal data is done in compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“Data Protection Legislation”). The terms “Personal Data”, “Special Categories of Personal Data”, “Personal Data Breach”, “Data Protection Officer”, “Data Controller”, “Data Processor”, “Data Subject” and “process” (in the context of usage of Personal Data) shall have the meanings given to them in the Data Protection Legislation. “Data Protection Lead” is the title given to the member of staff leading our data protection compliance programme in lieu of a requirement for a Data Protection Officer.

**What are your rights?**

When reading this notice, it might be helpful to understand that your rights arising under Data Protection Legislation include:

* The right to be informed of how your Personal Data is used (through this notice);
* The right to access any personal data held about you;
* The right to withdraw consent at any time, by opting-out using the options present in communications;
* The right to rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data held about you;
* The right to erasure where it cannot be justified that the information held satisfies any of the criteria outlined in this policy;
* The right to prevent processing for direct marketing purposes, scientific/historical research or in any such way that is likely to cause substantial damage to you or another, including through profile building; and
* The right to object to processing that results in decisions being made about you by automated processes and prevent those decisions being enacted.

You can access certain of your personal data held about you by logging in to your account on the store where you made your purchase. You can also gain access to your personal data by emailing dataprotection@sandbaguk.com with the subject line: “Subject Access Request”. When you submit a ‘subject access request’, you will need to provide confirmation of your identity by contacting us using the email address associated with your profile or attaching a photocopy of your driver’s license or passport. This is provided free of charge and our response will be made within thirty (30) days unless our Data Protection Lead deems your request as being excessive or unfounded. If this is the case, we will inform you of our reasonable administration costs in advance and/or any associated delays, giving you the opportunity to choose whether you would like to pursue your request. If you believe we have made a mistake in evaluating your request, please see the section ‘Who can you complain to?’.

If you have questions about any of the rights mentioned in this section, please contact our Data Protection Lead at [dataprotection@sandbaguk.com](mailto:dataprotection@sandbaguk.com).

### Who is the Data Controller?

* If your data has been passed to us by a third party for processing under their instruction, that third party is the Data Controller. They should have notified you that they would be passing your personal data to us, SANDBAG USA, at the time they collected your data and within their own privacy notices/standards. On some of the websites we manage, we collect your data on behalf of a Data Controller to add you to a mailing list or forum and we may pass your data to the Data Controller. For a list of Data Controllers, please see the section ‘Third Party Interests’ below.
* Where we collect your personal data for fulfilling purchases from one of our stores, or where you have opted in to receive marketing or other communications from us in relation to your previous purchase or to be added to a mailing list or forum that we manage, we are the Data Controller.
* If we have received your personal data as part of a direct administrative relationship between our business and yours, we are the Data Controller.

### What are the lawful bases for processing personal data?

Under Data Protection Legislation, there must be a ‘lawful basis’ for the use of personal data. The lawful bases are as follows:

1. ‘your consent’;
2. ‘performance of a contract’;
3. ‘compliance with a legal obligation’;
4. ‘protection of your, or another’s vital interests’;
5. ‘public interest/official authority’; and
6. ‘our legitimate interests’.

### What are SANDBAG USA’s ‘legitimate interests’?

Legitimate interests are a flexible basis upon which the law permits the processing of an individual’s personal data. To determine whether we have a legitimate interest in processing your data, we balance the needs and benefits to us against the risks and benefits for you of us processing your data. This balancing is performed as objectively as possible by our Data Protection Lead. You are able to object to our processing and we shall consider the extent to which this affects whether we have a legitimate interest. If you would like to find out more about our legitimate interests, please contact [dataprotection@sandbaguk.com](mailto:dataprotection@sandbaguk.com).

### What happens if I refuse to give SANDBAG USA my personal data?

If your personal data is used for selling you music, merchandise or tickets, your personal information has, in part, been collected as part of a statutory obligation arising under our contract with you and applicable laws. Failure to process your data could result in us being unable to fulfil your orders.

The information about you that we have collected for the performance of our contracts is required in order for us to successfully fulfil our obligations to you. If you choose not to provide the personal data requested, we will not be able to enter into a contract with you to provide the services we offer. If we are already processing your personal information under a contract, you must end our contractual relationship (as/where permitted) in order to exercise some of your rights. We process some personal information as part of a contractual relationship with a Data Controller. Any requests to restrict this type of processing should be forwarded to the Data Controller; they will be responsible for discussing your concerns and making any decisions.

### What profiling or automated decision making does SANDBAG USA perform?

SANDBAG USA does not perform any profiling or automated decision making based on your personal data.

### How long will your personal data be kept?

SANDBAG USA holds different categories of personal data for different periods of time. Wherever possible, we will endeavour to minimise the amount of personal data that we hold and the length of time for which it is held.

* If ‘consent’ is the basis for our lawful processing of your data, we will retain your data so long as both the purpose for which it was collected, and your consent, are still valid. For mailing lists, forums and marketing, we will consider your consent as valid so long as you continue to receive our emails and have not opted-out/unsubscribe, or login to our website forums. If your email address ceases to receive our messages (e.g. ‘bounces-back’), we will consider this a withdrawal of consent. Occasionally, we might identify a legitimate interest in retaining some of your personal data that has been obtained by consent. If we do, we will inform you that we intend to retain it under these conditions and identify the interest specifically.
* If we process your data on the basis of ‘legitimate interests’, we will retain your data for as long as the purpose for which it is processed remains active.
* All categories of personal data that are held by us because they are essential for the performance of a contract, will be held for a period of six years, or as otherwise required under applicable law, for the purposes of exercising or defending legal claims.

### Who else will receive your personal data?

SANDBAG USA may pass your data to the third parties listed in the section ‘Third Party Interests’ below.
