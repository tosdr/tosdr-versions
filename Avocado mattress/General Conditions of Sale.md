Terms, Conditions & Exclusions
------------------------------

1. **Mattresses Require a 30-Day Minimum Trial Period:** Your mattress and/or topper trial begins the day you receive your mattress or eligible topper. Please remember that it takes time to adjust to a new mattress. Your Avocado mattress is unlike _any_ mattress you’ve experienced before. Some people love it after the first night. For others, it takes a little longer. Depending on the type and condition of mattress you’re transitioning from, your body might need time to adjust to its gentle firmness. Experiencing proper posture and back support may cause a few aches and pains along the way. This might take a month or more. But you’ll appreciate it in the end. ([Here is an article](https://help.avocadogreenmattress.com/en/articles/4649936-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-new-mattress) with FAQs and tips.) That’s why we require that customers give their new mattress or eligible topper at least 30 days before requesting a return. Should you wish to proceed with a return after 30 days, we will work with you to arrange everything.
    
2. **Trials are Limited to One of Each Product Type:** Our sleep trial is limited to one return of each product type per household. If you return or exchange a product, it ends your sleep trial for that product type (mattress, topper, base, pillows, protectors, sheets), and no other sleep trials are eligible for your household in the future for that product type. Exceptions: two Green Pillows, two Latex Pillows, two Twin XL size mattresses (ONLY when used to make a single Split King for use on a single adjustable base) — two of which may be returned from a single order, since they are bought in pairs. We define this household-wide policy by your customer name, shipping address, billing method/account, or billing address.
    
3. **Trials are available only to products purchased directly from Avocado.** If you buy our products through another retailer, you are not eligible for our trial program. We encourage you to purchase directly from Avocado to take advantage of our extended trial offer and experience.
    
4. **U.S. Service Area Only:** Our serviceable area for mattress pickups, returns, exchanges, and refunds is the United States only, which includes Alaska and Hawaii. All U.S. territories and international locations are excluded from the Sleep Trial. Mattresses taken outside our serviceable area must be returned to our service area at the owner's risk and expense to be eligible.
    
5. **Products Must Be In Suitable Condition for Donation with Law Tags Attached:** Mattresses & bedding products must be in a condition suitable for donation to be eligible for return (i.e., no stains, tears, excessive odors, or soiling). Law tags must be attached to the mattress or topper in its original, unaltered state. We require photos to confirm that your product is in the appropriate condition to be donated. Your return will be denied if our pickup partner determines your item is unsuitable for donation. Protect your mattress with our [Organic Mattress Pad Protector](https://www.avocadogreenmattress.com/collections/protectors/products/mattress-pad-protector) or [Organic Waterproof Mattress Protector](https://www.avocadogreenmattress.com/collections/protectors/products/organic-waterproof-mattress-protector).
    
6. **Improper Mattress Usage will Void the Trial:** Your mattress must be used on a foundation or non-yielding bed frame with proper structural support. A proper bed frame is defined, for the purpose of this Mattress Warranty, as having at least five to six (5-6) leg support for a Queen, King, and California King Mattress, four (4) leg support for Twin and Full Mattresses. For Queen, King, and California King slatted style bed frames, there cannot be greater than five (5) inches between each slat to provide ample structural support for the foundation and user(s). Each slat must be at least two and a half (2.5) inches wide. A boxspring, which contains springs and can sag over time, may not provide proper structural support and will void the sleep trial and warranty.
    
7. **Mattresses Must Be Rotated:** Mattresses must be rotated head-to-toe, once a month for the first six months, then every other month, to ensure even wear. Failure to do so voids the Sleep Trial.
    
8. **Mattress Boxes Must Be Opened within 30 Days of Receipt.** Failure to open your mattress within this period voids the Sleep Trial.
    
9. **Free Items are Not Eligible for Returns:** Naturally, items not paid for — such as the two free pillows included in some of our sales — are not eligible for a sleep trial or returns.
    
10. **Final Sale Items are Not Eligible for Returns:** Naturally, items listed as final sale — such as furniture (including adjustable bases), clearance or discontinued products, and our latex mattress — are not eligible for a sleep trial or returns.
    
11. **Financing Fees are Non-Refundable.**
    
12. **Shipping Fees and In-Home Delivery & Setup Fees are Non-Refundable.** If an order is canceled at any point after shipment commences, associated shipping fees are non-refundable. For Lost or damaged orders
    
13. **Shipping Surcharges for Alaska and Hawaii are Non-Refundable.**
    
14. **Route Shipping Insurance Fees are Non-Refundable.**
    
15. Once we **confirm receipt** of your returned items, you will receive your refund payment within 1-3 business days (although, depending on your bank, the refunded money can take about two weeks to process back into your account). Refunds can only be made via the original form of payment and credit card. We cannot refund to a different credit card and do not issue checks.
    
16. Lost or damaged products **must be reported** promptly, according to our shipping issues guidelines posted [here](https://help.avocadogreenmattress.com/en/articles/6480381-what-is-route-protection-why-purchase-it). Failure to report a claim within the designated time frame will void your trial and warranty.
    
17. **All returns must be received and verified before the end of your trial or within 30 days of your first request, whichever comes first.** Please note that if we don’t receive and verify your returned item within this timeframe, we will assume that you no longer wish to return it and will close the return request.
