Avocado Mattress reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in New Jersey in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Avocado Mattress as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. Avocado Mattress LLC’s performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal processes, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Avocado Mattress LLC’s right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by Avocado Mattress with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and Avocado Mattress with respect to the Site, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between the user and Avocado Mattress with respect to the Site.

**Dispute Resolution, Arbitration**

AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: You and we agree to submit any dispute arising under this agreement, with the exception of disputes alleging criminal or statutory violations, to binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the Better Business Bureau (Binding). A volunteer BBB arbitrator will render a decision that the arbitrator considers to be fair; in doing so, the arbitrator is not required to apply legal principles. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding on both you and us, and judgment on the decision may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. All administrative fees for the arbitration will be paid by the business. Further information about BBB arbitration may be obtained by calling the BBB Serving New Jersey at 609-588-0808. This Agreement to Arbitrate affects important legal rights. Neither of us will be able to go to court for disputes that must be arbitrated.

No waiver or failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such right or provision or any other right or provision.
