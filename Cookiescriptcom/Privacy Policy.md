Company registration number: 304037472

### 2\. What information do we collect?

You may visit our site anonymously although cookies are used to identify your session.

#### **2.1. Contact form data**

If you choose to use the inquiry form on our website, basic contact details are collected such as the email and name of the contact person

#### **2.2. Account data**

When you register for an account, we collect and store your e-mail address.

#### **2.3. Membership data**

In order to issue an invoice for paid services, we also need to collect additional contact details about you or your business, such as full name, email, contact address, business name, and business activity. We do not collect or store your credit card information. All payments are collected using PayPal or Stripe payment processing systems, therefore we also store PayPal or Stripe transaction ID.

#### **2.4. [CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") item data**

When you create or edit [CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") item, we collect your direct input, which is a website domain name for use of CookieScript service (the “**Service**”) and possible content and settings for [Cookie Policy](https://cookie-script.com/privacy-policy-generator "Cookie Policy") pop-up notification box (the “**Pop-up**”) displayed on the website visitor (“**End Users**”).

#### **2.5. End User data**

End-User data can be collected only if you have a proper subscription to the CookieScript website. If enabled, Service can automatically log the following data about End Users:

* An anonymous and random key (the **“Key”**);
* End User’s choice (accept or reject);
* Anonymized End User’s IP address (last digits after “.” are set to 0);
* Date and time of End User’s agreement/rejection;
* The page where consent was given/revoked;
* End User’s browser agent.

The Key together with the Consent state are saved in the End User’s browser as a first-party cookie called “CookieScriptConsent” in JSON encrypted form. This information is later used by the Service to remember the End User’s choice. The key can be found in the [Cookie Consent](https://cookie-script.com/cookie-consent "Cookie Consent") Banner > About cookies tab. The Key can also be used as proof of the End User’s consent. The Key is not considered personally identifiable information.

#### **2.6. Automatically generated data**

The service automatically generates statistical data (if enabled in settings for CookieScript Item) which is the number of clicks on each button of the Pop-up and Cookie Category preferences. This data is aggregated (clicks per day) and cannot be used to identify a particular End User.

### 3\. What do we use your information for?

Any of the information we collect may be used for one or more of the following purposes:

* To answer your inquiry;
* To contact you regarding our services;
* To identify you as a contracting party;
* To enable CookieScript to issue valid invoices and to process transactions;
* To enable secure login for you in the Service;

### 4\. Legal basis

* Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
