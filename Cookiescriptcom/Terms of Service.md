Terms of Service Agreement 
===========================

### 1\. Subject matter

This Agreement regulates all relations between:

Objectis Ltd.  
Laisves st. 60  
LT-05120 Vilnius  
Lithuania

(referred to hereafter as “CookieScript”) and the customer regarding the use of [CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") services (the “Services”) under the URL https://[Cookie-Script](https://cookie-script.com/ "Cookie-Script").com.

Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using the Services. These Terms of Service (collectively, with [CookieScript's Privacy Policy](https://cookie-script.com/privacy-policy.html "CookieScript's Privacy Policy"), located at [https://cookie-script.com/privacy-policy.html](https://cookie-script.com/privacy-policy.html "https://cookie-script.com/privacy-policy.html")) apply to all users of the Services. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such organization to these Terms of Service and you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service on behalf of such organization.

Buying or using [CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") products or services implies that the user/customer has both read and accepted these Terms of Service. This is also indicated by a mandatory checkbox/dropdown during registration/purchase of membership. [CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") reserves the right to change or modify current Terms of Service without prior notice.

### 2\. The Services

[CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") Services allow you to display a pop-up notification box(the “Pop-up”), that can be used on your website for different purposes. It may be used to inform your website visitors (“End Users”) about your website's [Privacy Policy](https://cookie-script.com/gdpr-and-e-privacy-regulation-compliance.html "Privacy Policy") and Cookie usage.

[CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") is only the service provider and it is your own responsibility to ensure correct settings and implementation of [CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") is used on your website in case you use it to comply with a certain law, regulation, or directive, including but not limited to EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and EU’s ePrivacy Directive.

[CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") offers a set of options for the Pop-up, which is constantly updating to ensure Services cover as many customers' needs as possible.

[CookieScript](https://cookie-script.com/ "CookieScript") organizes server resources in a way to provide a high level of service with at least 99.9% uptime on the operation of the cloud service, both website and script hosting.

### 3\. Membership subscriptions

Purchasing a membership will give you access to additional CookieScript functionality and premium support. All functionality you get is described on [Pricing Page](https://cookie-script.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23&Itemid=211 "Pricing Page"). By purchasing a paid membership, you agree that:

* There is no warranty or in any other way any form of liability on the side of CookieScript.
* CookieScript reserves the right to offer discounts or permanent price changes at any moment, without prior notice.

The account that purchased the membership, cannot be shared. Sharing or other methods that allow for multiple users to access the same account are strictly forbidden and may result in termination of the account and support.

#### 3.1. Free membership

Free Membership users are not allowed to download or modify JavaScript files used to show cookie pop-up warning messages. Violation of those rules may result in termination of the account and support that comes with Free Membership.

Free Membership user’s Pop-up displays a copyright text with a link to [Cookie-Script](https://cookie-script.com/ "Cookie-Script").com which is not allowed to be removed. Trying to modify source code and remove links to [Cookie-Script](https://cookie-script.com/ "Cookie-Script").com may result in termination of the account and free support.

#### 3.2. Paid memberships

Users that have purchased functionality to self-host JavaScript files are allowed to download/modify/publish JavaScript files that are used to show the Pop-up to fit the user's purposes without any prior notice.

Paid Membership duration, price, and other limitations are described on the [Pricing page](https://cookie-script.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23&Itemid=211 "Pricing page") and can be modified without prior notice.

Your Paid Membership limitations and functionality is locked to your account during purchase and will not be reduced later during the membership period. After the membership period finishes and needs to be renewed, the latest limitations and prices from the Pricing page will be applied to your membership.

CookieScript feature limitation policy is targeted to keep all the existing functionality user currently has and only include more functionality with every update.

### 4\. Payments

Payments may be completed through the PayPal or Stripe payment system. We do not store or share any personal information associated with a payment (like Credit Card number, owner, or expiration date). Some information available in PayPal and Stripe is stored on PayPal/Stripe as part of the transaction history. More information about what information is stored and processed by payment processors is available on [CookieScript's Privacy Policy page](https://cookie-script.com/privacy-policy.html "CookieScript's Privacy Policy page").

If the Paid Membership period is limited, a periodic payment will be automatically created in PayPal/Stripe to extend your membership when the initial membership period is over. You can cancel this automatic periodic payment directly in PayPal or in your CookieScript account.

The exact price to be charged is calculated automatically using prices from the [Pricing page](https://cookie-script.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23&Itemid=211 "Pricing page") and provided billing information.

The final charge, including all taxes, will be displayed before the order is made. The amount of VAT, which may be added to the charge, is 21% of the total billing amount and will be added depending on the location and legal entity of the purchaser. According to the European Union Council Directive 2006/112/EC, **21%** VAT will be added if the purchaser

* is from Lithuania
* is from within the European Union and does not have a European VAT ID

Companies and private customers from the United Kingdom pay UK VAT, which is **20%**.

Companies inside the EU (except Lithuania) and all other customers outside the EU pay **0%** VAT.

Once payment is complete, you will receive a VAT Invoice with CookieScript company details.

Though we cannot control all the sites or customers that use CookieScript, we do not support or allow for use of our products or services on adult or gambling sites, sites with illegal content, or sites that are considered toxic websites. Accounts that violate this requirement can be suspended without prior notice.

### 7\. Limitation of Liability for Loss or Damage

In conjunction with the Disclaimer and Warranty as explained above, you expressly understand and agree that any claim against us shall be limited to the amount you paid, if any, for use of services. CookieScript will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or exemplary loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of using our services, or as a result of any changes, data loss or corruption, cancellation, loss of access, or downtime to the full extent that applicable limitation of liability laws apply.

### 8\. Support

In case of any bugs/errors found by users, CookieScript Support makes all efforts to fix those errors/bugs.

CookieScript reserves the right to limit or cancel support in the following situations:

* unreasonable behavior by the client; such as bad language, racism, etc.;
* continued/repeating (server) issues that cannot (or should not) be resolved by CookieScript;
* the client is not cooperative in providing additional details on the issues raised.

### 9\. Refund policy

CookieScript offers a full money-back guarantee for a period of 7 days after purchase. In case of a refund, the user’s account will be completely deleted.

Users have the possibility to try the free CookieScript version and see if it works correctly on the user's website.

Free Membership users can also get Paid Membership for a limited time to test all Paid Membership features and compatibility with their website.

In order to get a refund, the user must:

* contact CookieScript Support and explain a reason for a refund;
* give CookieScript Support a possibility to fix a bug/error if the bug/error is the reason for a refund.

In case a bug/error is related to CookieScript, CookieScript Support cannot fix the bug/error and the user met all requirements above, the user can ask for a full refund (excluding possible transaction costs).

### 10\. Termination

We have the right to terminate your access to any or all of our products and services at any time, without notice, for any reason, including without limitation, breach of these Terms of Service. We may also at any time, at our sole discretion, discontinue the products, website, or services or any part thereof without prior notice and you agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the products, website or services.
