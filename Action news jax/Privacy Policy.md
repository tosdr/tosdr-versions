_Last Updated February 26, 2024_

  

This Privacy Statement describes how CMG Media Corporation d/b/a Cox Media Group, along with our affiliates, (collectively, “CMG”) collects personal information through websites, mobile and other online applications, and products and services operated by [CMG Network](https://www.actionnewsjax.com/privacy-policy/%E2%80%9Chttps://www.cmg.com/brands/%E2%80%9C) (collectively, the “CMG Network Sites”) that link to this Privacy Statement, and the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to that information.

  

By using these CMG Network Sites, you consent to the use of information about you in accordance with this Privacy Statement, including our communications using the email address you provide through one or more of these CMG Network Sites. This Privacy Statement applies only to the CMG Network Sites that link to this Privacy Statement and does not apply to any other sites or CMG affiliates that maintain a separate privacy statement. Unless otherwise noted in communications you may receive from us, this Privacy Statement does not apply to information you may provide to us through offline methods, for example, at live event premises or via telephone.

  

Updates to This Privacy Statement

We may update this Privacy Statement to provide clarification or reflect changes to our practices. If we make changes, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Statement.

**11\. Your California Privacy Rights**

This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, disclose and share personal information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that personal information.

* **• Information.** You can request information about the categories of Personal Information that we have collected; the categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, sharing and/or selling Personal Information; the categories of any Personal Information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and the categories of any third parties with whom Personal Information was sold, shared or disclosed for a business purpose.
* **• Access.** You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you.

This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you services; increasing the price/rate of services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.

* **• Deidentified data.** We do not to attempt to reidentify deidentified information that we derive from Personal Information except that we may do so to test whether our deidentification processes comply with applicable law.
