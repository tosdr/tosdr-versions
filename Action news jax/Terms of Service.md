(BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY AND THE LIABILITY OF OUR AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS IS LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY SUCH STATE LAW.) YOU AGREE THAT OUR LIABILITY AND THE LIABILITY OF OUR AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS, IF ANY, ARISING OUT OF ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE USE OF THE SERVICE. LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES WILL BE LIMITED AND EXCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRECEDING SENTENCE EVEN IF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

  
**DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

  
**Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and the CMG Affiliate (including any parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents of ours) agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, or the Agreement and prior versions of the Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and the CMG Affiliate may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you and the CMG Affiliate may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

This Arbitration Agreement does not prevent you from filing or joining a complaint with any federal, state or local government agency that is authorized by law to seek relief against us on your behalf.

  
**Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND THE CMG AFFILIATE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.** You and the CMG Affiliate are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the paragraph entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.

  
**Class Action Waiver. YOU AND THE CMG AFFILIATE AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “BATCH ARBITRATION” BELOW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.** Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection, “Class Action Waiver” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and the CMG Affiliate agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and shall be pursued in the state or federal courts located in Fulton County, Georgia. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or the CMG Affiliate from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

  
**Informal Dispute Resolution.** You and the CMG Affiliate that operates the Service agree to try to resolve any Dispute informally before resorting to arbitration. You and the CMG Affiliate therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.

  
The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to the CMG Affiliate that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to [notice@cmg.com](https://www.actionnewsjax.com/visitor-agreement/%E2%80%9Dmailto:notice@cmg.com%E2%80%9D) or regular mail to our offices located at 1601 W. Peachtree St. NE, Atlanta, GA 30309, Attention: Legal Department. Notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your account or to your publicly available address or email address if you do not have an account with us. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute./

  
The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.

  
**Arbitration Procedures.** You and the CMG Affiliate that operates the Service agree that this Arbitration Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., applies. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within 60 days after receipt of your Notice, you and the CMG Affiliate agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The AAA's rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes then in effect will apply. If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect will apply. If there is a conflict between the AAA's rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.

  
A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. To initiate arbitration, you must send the Request to Legal Department, 1601 W. Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30309. If we initiate arbitration, we will send the Request to the email address associated with your account or to your publicly available address or email address if you do not have an account with us. Both parties must comply with the AAA's rules regarding initiation of arbitration.

  
Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA rules. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

  
Unless you and the CMG Affiliate otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed below is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.

  
**Arbitrator.** If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 35 days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process described below is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.

  
**Authority of Arbitrator.** The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the paragraph entitled “Class Action Waiver,” including any claim that that same paragraph is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the paragraph entitled “Batch Arbitration,” all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

  
**Batch Arbitration.** To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and the CMG Affiliate agree that in the event that there are 100 or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against the CMG Affiliate by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a 30 day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).

  
All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by the CMG Affiliate.

  
You and the CMG Affiliate agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.

  
**30-Day Right to Opt Out.** You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Legal Department, 1601 W. Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30309, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us. If the Dispute is not covered by any arbitration agreement between you and us, it shall proceed before the state or federal courts located in Fulton County, Georgia.

  
**Invalidity, Expiration.** Except as provided in the subsection entitled “Class Action Waiver” above, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

  
**Modification.** Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if the CMG Affiliate makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject the change within 30 days of such change become effective by writing to the CMG Affiliate at Legal Department, 1601 W. Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30309, your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. The CMG Affiliate will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.

Otherwise you agree to pay our actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.
