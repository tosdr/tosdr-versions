**SECTION 1 - TERMS**  
Welcome to Redact.dev, a suite of applications and websites (the “Applications”) that facilitate the removal of data and makes privacy optimizations on your behalf (collectively with the Applications, the “Services”). The Services are provided to you by Redact Holdings, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”). By utilizing the Applications to perform the Services you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Service” or “Terms”). These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Services. Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using the Applications or Services. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms, then you may not access or use any Services. Any new features or tools, which are added to the current Services shall also be subject to the Terms of Service. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at https://redact.dev/terms which supersedes any other Terms of Service available in the Services. We reserve the right to update, change or replace any part of these Terms of Service by posting updates and/or changes to https://redact.dev/terms. It is your responsibility to check this page periodically for changes, which can be done manually or by using automated alert tools such as visualping.io or any other website page monitor. Your continued use of or access to the Applications following the posting of any changes on https://redact.dev/terms constitutes acceptance of those changes. The headings used in these Terms are included for convenience only and will not limit or otherwise affect these Terms.  
  
PLEASE CAREFULLY READ AND MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE “ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS” PROVISION SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN SECTION 16, AS IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS PROVISION SET FORTH BELOW.  
  
By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you represent that you are at least the age of 18 and above the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence. You may not use our Services for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may you, in the use of the Services, violate any laws in your jurisdiction. A breach or violation of any of the Terms will result in an immediate termination of your access to and use of the Services.  
  
**SECTION 1A: THIRD PARTY SERVICES**  
  
The Services function by requesting, modifying or deleting data on third party services. Third Party Services (“Third Party Services”) are defined as any website, program, offering or service not owned by us that you may use our Services to interact with. This includes social networks, messengers, productivity tools, utilities, data brokers, information aggregators, “people finder” sites AND any other service you may access from the Applications, including any affiliates or partners of such Third Party Services.  
It is possible that a Third Party Service’s own terms of service will disallow access to its services by software such as the Services. Because Third Party Services may have dozens of different applicable versions of their terms of service for different countries, devices or classifications of individuals, we cannot review or even access terms of service for all supported Third Party Services.  
By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understand all applicable Third Party Services’ own terms of service and you hereby affirm that your use of the Services is either authorized or that you have a specific waiver or legal protection which allows your lawful usage of the Services.  
If you do not have authorization from a Third Party Service to use the Services, such use could result in a violation of the applicable terms of service which could include significant penalties to you, such as your being banned or suspended from using such Third Party Service, legal action against you by a Third Party Service or other adverse results such as financial penalties or criminal liabilities.  
To the greatest extent possible, we expressly disclaim any liability with respect to any potential violation by you of such terms of service arising from your use of the Services. You agree to review any Third Party Service’s terms of service that may bind or apply to you and to not engage in any activity violating such terms of service when using the Services in any manner whatsoever.  
  
**SECTION 1B - USER ACKNOWLEDGED CONDITIONS**

* The Applications have a built-in archiving system that attempts to make a copy of any data that is previewed or deleted locally to your device. This feature may be disabled or enabled by default depending on several factors. However, the archiving system is a convenience feature and provided as is and with no guarantees or warranties. It should NOT be relied upon. ;
* Your use of the Services may result in the deletion of more of your data than intended;
* Your use of the Services may not delete all data that you intended to delete;
* Our Services might report that we have completed an action, even though that action was not completed, for example, a report of a completed deletion of data when the data was not actually deleted.
* Applicable Third Party Services, or their affiliates or partners, may still maintain copies of data that you intended to delete using the Services;
* We do not maintain any online backups whatsoever of data that you process using the Services;

**SECTION 12 – SEVERABILITY**  
In the event that any provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.  
  
**SECTION 13 – TERMINATION**  
The obligations and liabilities incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of these Terms for all purposes.

**SECTION 15 - GOVERNING LAW**  
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction).  
  
**SECTION 16 – ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS**  
YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THESE TERMS, SHALL BE DETERMINED BY ARBITRATION BEFORE ONE ARBITRATOR. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY JAMS PURSUANT TO ITS COMPREHENSIVE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES IN THOSE RULES.  
Judgment on the award of any such arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not prevent parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  
YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

You and the Company shall maintain the confidential nature of any arbitration proceeding and any award, including the arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.  
The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by JAMS or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of these Terms and will be final and binding.  
In any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms, there shall be no interrogatories or requests to admit.  
IN ANY ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR(S) ARE NOT EMPOWERED TO AWARD PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EXCEPT WHERE PERMITTED BY STATUTE, AND THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY SUCH DAMAGES. THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT AWARD ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS.  
As stated in Section 15 of these Terms, Delaware law governs this entire agreement, but the parties acknowledge that this agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce, and that notwithstanding Section 15, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

In addition, regardless of the outcome of the dispute case, we reserve the right to terminate your access to our software immediately with no refund due to you for any unused portion of time.
