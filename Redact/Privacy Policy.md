Cookies and Other Technologies

We automatically collect information about your use of our Site through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we combine this information with other information we collect about you, including your personal information. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Website and Services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Website and Services. Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have closed your browser or turned off your device. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Website and Services who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Website, but some features may not function  
  
We use third-party browser and mobile analytics services like Google Analytics in connection with the Services. These services use data collection tools to help us analyze use of the Services, including information like the third-party website you arrive from, how often you visit, events within the Services, usage and performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We use this data to improve the Services, better understand how the Services perform on different devices, and provide information that may be of interest to you. We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site and on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including personal information, about you. Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members. Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies' delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site, Services, or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA's website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI's website at www.networkadvertising.org.

Our Websites are intended for individuals 18 years of age and older. They are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect any information, including Personal Data, from children under 18 years of age. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected Personal Data from a child under the age of 18, please contact us at the email address in Section XI below, and we will take immediate steps to delete it.  
  
  

Changes to Privacy Policy

We will provide adequate notice of any material changes and obtain your consent when legally required when making such changes to this Privacy Policy.

Data Subject Rights under the GDPR

These rights are not absolute and are subject to various conditions under applicable data protection and privacy legislation and the laws and regulations to which we are subject. In some cases, the exercise of these rights (for example, erasure, objection, restriction or the withholding or withdrawing of consent to processing) may make it impossible for us to provide services.  
  
**Right Not to Provide Consent or to Withdraw Consent.** We may seek to rely on your consent in order to Process certain Personal Data. Where we do so, you have the right not to provide your consent, and the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of the Processing conducted based on consent before its withdrawal.

**Right of Erasure.** In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we erase Personal Data concerning you; for example, if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected and we do not otherwise have a legitimate reason to retain it. We may need to retain certain Personal Data when legally required, for internal, record keeping purposes, and/or in order to complete any transactions initiated prior to an individual’s request to remove or delete their Personal Data. Where we are unable to delete data from our systems, we will anonymize it so it will no longer be tied to your identity.  
**Right to Restrict Processing**. In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we restrict the Processing of the Personal Data that we have collected about you; for example, where you believe that the Personal Data that we hold about you is not accurate or lawfully held.  
**Right to Data Portability.** In certain circumstances, you have the right to receive the Personal Data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, machine readable format, and for us to transmit the data to another entity where technically feasible.  
**Right to Object to the Processing.** In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we stop Processing your Personal Data, including where we rely on legitimate interests as legal basis in the tables on the details of Processing provided above. If you receive commercial electronic communications from us, you can unsubscribe from the receipt of future commercial electronic communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link provided in such communications. Please also note that if you do opt out of receiving commercial electronic communications from us, we may still send you important administrative messages (such as updates about your account or changes in the Services), and you cannot opt out from receiving these messages, unless you stop receiving our Services.  
**Right Not to be Subject to Decisions Based Solely on Automated Processing that Produce Legal Effects.** We do not make decisions based solely on automated processing - including profiling - that produces legal effects or similarly affects you.  
**Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority.** You have the right to lodge a complaint with a Supervisory Authority if you believe that our Processing of Personal Data relating to you is inconsistent with our obligations under the GDPR. In this situation, we ask you please consider contacting us first, so that we can try and assist with your query or address your concern.  
  
To exercise any of your rights as set forth herein, please contact us in writing, via email or postal mail as indicated above, so that we may consider your request under applicable law. We may ask that you provide the following Personal Data for us to address your request speedily:

• A clear description of the Personal Data or content you wish to receive or to be deleted or corrected, or the action you wish to be taken; and  
• Sufficient information to allow us to locate the content or Personal Data to be deleted, removed, or corrected.  
  
For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Data that are associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request. In addition, please note that, depending on the nature of your inquiry, request, or complaint, we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request and may require proof of identity, such as in the form of a government issued ID and proof of your physical address. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case within the timelines prescribed by applicable laws. However, we reserve the right to refuse to act on a request that is manifestly unfounded or excessive (for example because it is repetitive) and/or, in some cases, to charge a fee that takes into account the administrative costs for providing the information or the communication or taking the action requested.
