    When you create a Campaign on the Site and ask for Contributions, you understand that you are entering into separate legal agreements with both Indiegogo and with your Contributors, and the following rules apply (in addition to all other Terms and Additional Policies).
    
    1. Make good faith efforts to fulfill the Perks associated with Your Campaign in the timeframe that You communicate to Contributors, and prioritize fulfillment of those Perks.
    2. Be responsive. Respond promptly and truthfully to all questions posed in comments, messages, or updates including any questions or requests Indiegogo makes to verify ability to fulfill. If unresponsive or if a dispute arises between You and your Backers, We may provide your name, legal mailing address and email address to your Contributors, or in the instances where the law requires it.
    3. Updates. Provide substantive and quality updates at least once a month to Contributors. Immediately notify Contributors if there are obstacles or delays.
    4. If you have received the Contributions from your Campaign, but are unable to deliver Perks, issue refunds to Contributors.
    5. Comply with Laws. Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in statements concerning Your Campaign and Perk(s), the use of Contributions and delivery of Perks.
    6. Be Truthful and Transparent. Campaign Team Members should be ready, willing, and able to substantiate claims your Campaign makes, including but not limited to product features and capabilities, the stage of product development, and timelines for delivery with verifiable evidence if requested. If you are unable to uphold claims, Indiegogo may terminate your account, withhold funds, provide your name, mailing and email address, or take other actions to enforce its rights under this Agreement and applicable law.
    7. Respect Privacy. When you use the Services by creating a Campaign, you may receive information about Users that have Contributed to your Campaign, including personally identifiable information (“**_PII_**”), such as names, e-mail addresses, and physical addresses. This information is provided to you purely for the purpose of fulfilling the Perks for the applicable Campaign and other Services, and may not be used or disclosed for any other purposes, including cross-promotional marketing of any other products including your own other products, without separate, verifiable consent from the User obtained independently from Indiegogo or the Service. You will maintain, and be required to produce if requested, records of all such verifiable consent.
        1. Comply with EEA Data Controller Obligations. As a Campaign Owner, you will independently fulfill all duties required of data controllers under applicable EEA data protection law (such law shall include, but not be limited to, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“**_GDPR_**”); (iii) the EU e-Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC), including subsequent variations, such as the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the respect for private life and the protection of personal data in electronic communications and repealing Directive 2002/58/EC (“**_ePrivacy Regulation_**”), if enacted); and the current Standard Contractual Clauses (“**_SCCs_**”) for Co-Controllers for international data transfers. Data transfers are in accordance with the SCCs and are detailed in the [Privacy Policy](https://www.indiegogo.com/about/privacy).
        2. Your data controller duties include:
            1. Determining and qualifying the necessary legal basis or bases for your collection or processing of personal information;
            2. Managing and reporting security incidents;
            3. Transfers;
            4. Entering into contracts with only with data processors that provide adequate protections for personal data and including appropriate contractual language;
            5. Maintaining records of your data processing activities;
            6. Conducting any required data protection impact assessments; and
            7. Implementing and maintaining all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR.
        3. Respond to EEA Data Subject Requests. You and Indiegogo will have an independent obligation to respond to any requests received by either of us from EEA data subjects regarding personal data, including without limitation, those set forth in Chapter III of the GDPR. EEA data subjects may include Contributors or any other party whose information you obtained in relation to your Campaign. The party that receives the data request is responsible for responding to the request. Campaign Owner and Indiegogo shall reasonably cooperate and assist each other with these requests, to the extent that is legally permissible.
        4. Comply with the CCPA as a Business. As a Campaign Owner, you will independently fulfill all duties required of “businesses” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), including its implementing regulations. As a “business” under the CCPA, you will, without limitation: (1) provide notices to consumers as required by the CCPA, including providing a privacy policy and a notice of financial incentives, as applicable; (2) respond and honor access and deletion requests of consumers; (3) comply with all CCPA requirements related to the “sale” of personal information, as that term is defined in the statute; (4) implement reasonable security as required by the CCPA; (5) maintain records as required by the CCPA, including records related to your receipt and responses to consumer access and deletion requests; and (6) enter into appropriate contracts with vendors where required by the statute. For clarity, the party that receives a consumer request related to the CCPA is responsible for responding to the request. Campaign Owner and Indiegogo shall reasonably cooperate and assist each other with these requests, to the extent that is legally permissible.
    8. Platform Fees. Campaign Owners are charged a [Platform Fee](https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204456408-Fees-Pricing) as a portion of the Contributions they raise (the "**_Platform Fees_**"). The Platform Fees are effective on the date that the Platform Fees are posted and may be updated from time to time. Platform Fees will be charged at the then-current rate.
    9. Taxes. Taxing authorities may classify Contributions as taxable income to the Campaign Owner and any beneficiary who will receive funds directly from the applicable Campaign. Indiegogo may ask for the tax identification number (TIN) of Campaign Owners and any beneficiaries so that We may report taxable income to the relevant taxing authorities. Indiegogo will provide Campaign Owners with a tax document if required by the relevant taxing authorities. Indiegogo is unable to provide any User or third party with tax advice and suggests that such Users or third parties consult with tax advisors of their choice. The shipment of Perks to Contributors may expose Campaign Owners and Contributors to sales and use tax obligations.
    10. Respond to Requests from Indiegogo for Information about Your Campaign. Indiegogo does not guarantee any Campaigns or undertake the duty to investigate or moderate any statements made by a Campaign Owner (see section 4 below). However, Indiegogo may, but is not required to and undertakes no obligation to, request information from Campaign Owners to investigate possible breaches of this Agreement. The information Indiegogo may request includes, but is not limited to, information to support Campaign statements, evidence that the Campaign Owner is taking actions to deliver promised products, productions and shipping timelines and information, source documentation to substantiate product claims and Campaign promises, product prototypes, and personal information to confirm the identity of Campaign Owners, vendors, and suppliers. You agree that Indiegogo may employ third parties to assess the documents and your Campaign. You agree to provide this information to Indiegogo upon request. Failure to provide any of the requested information within 14 days, or a longer time provided by Indiegogo in writing, shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
    11. Indiegogo Reserves the Right to Withhold Funds. Campaign Owners are not guaranteed to receive Contributions made to a Campaign, even after the Campaign has ended and the fundraising goal has been reached. There may be a delay between the end of a Campaign and Our remittance of Contributions to a Campaign Owner for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, refunds, chargeback disputes, fraud, Terms or other policy violations, or any other situation. For example, Indiegogo may withhold Contributions made to a Campaign if the Campaign Owner violates any Terms (as determined by Indiegogo in its sole discretion). Additionally, Indiegogo may withhold funds pending the receipt and evaluation of information requested through paragraph (j) above or during the pendency of any investigation Indiegogo may undertake into your account. If you do not provide information within the requested time or are not able to substantiate claims made in your Campaign, Indiegogo may terminate your Campaign and account and avail itself of any remedies available to it under this Agreement or applicable law. Indiegogo may also withhold funds from Campaign Owners for any other breach of this Agreement. Indiegogo may also seek reimbursement from a Campaign Owner by any other lawful means, including by using third-party collection services.
    12. Refunds. Indiegogo offers a limited refund to Contributors in accordance with Our [Refund Policy](https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526876). Refunds outside of Our Refund Policy must be handled by the Campaign Owner, and Indiegogo has no obligation to provide any refunds or become involved with any dispute between a Campaign Owner and Contributor. Indiegogo reserves the right to terminate User Accounts and remove Campaigns for any abuse of the [Refund Policy](https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/213172367). Indiegogo reserves its right to issue refunds at its own discretion outside of the Refund Policy.
    
    Please remember that as a Campaign Owner, you are solely responsible for fulfilling the obligations of your Campaign and delivering Perks. If you are unable to perform on this, or any of your other legal obligations, you may be subject to legal action by Contributors. Your legal mailing address and contact information may be shared with Contributors seeking legal action.
    
4. ### Backing a Campaign
    
    As a Contributor, when you make a Contribution to a Campaign, you understand that the following rules and Terms apply (in addition to all other Terms, including Additional Policies).
    
    1. Voluntary Contributions. All Contributions are made voluntarily and at the sole discretion and risk of the Contributor.
    2. Indiegogo Does Not Guarantee that Campaigns Will Succeed or that Perks Will Be Delivered or Deemed Satisfactory. By contributing to a Campaign, Contributors are supporting an idea, project, or cause they care about and want to help make happen. Like anyone getting in on an early-stage project, Contributors accept the risk that the Campaign may experience changes, delays, and unforeseen challenges, or that a Campaign, and its Perks, might not come to fruition. **Indiegogo does not guarantee or represent that Contributions will be used as promised, that Campaign Owners will deliver Perks, or that the Campaign will achieve its goals. Indiegogo undertakes no duty to investigate claims made by Campaign Owners. Indiegogo also does not endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties regarding the quality, safety, morality or legality of any Campaign, Perk or Contribution, or the truth or accuracy of any User Content posted on the Services.** The date to deliver a Perk is an estimate by the Campaign Owner (not Indiegogo), and there is no guarantee that the Campaign Owner will fulfill and deliver the Perk by that date. No transfer of title to tangible personal property occurs through Indiegogo.
    3. Limited Refund. Indiegogo offers a limited refund to Contributors, subject to the [Refund Policy](https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526876), only where the Campaign has not ended, the Contributor has not received a Perk (as confirmed by Indiegogo), _and_ the Contribution has not been sent to the Campaign Owner. Indiegogo does not offer refunds outside Our Refund Policy, but may do so under our sole discretion. Where refunds are not available under the Refund Policy, a Contributor may contact the Campaign Owner directly to request a refund. Indiegogo has no obligation to participate or become involved in any dispute between Contributor and Campaign Owner concerning a refund.
    4. Credit Card Charges. When you Contribute to a Campaign, your card will be charged the amount of the Contribution after you confirm and submit your payment information.
    5. Communications Between Campaign Owners and Contributors. Once you have made a Contribution to a Campaign, the Campaign Owners may need to contact you to obtain additional information such as shipping address, specific preferences for a Perk (for example, color or size of a t-shirt), or may ask for feedback on the Campaign or the Perk. In some instances, to receive the Perk, you may need to provide requested information within a specific time frame to receive the Perk. Not doing so may result in your forfeiting the Perk. Campaign Owners should not ask for information that is not required to fulfill a Perk, including personal information such as Social Security numbers or credit card/banking information. Please contact us [here](http://indiegogo.com/contact) if you receive a request for information that appears to be excessive.
    6. Taxes are your responsibility . Contributors bear the sole responsibility for determining how to treat their Contributions and receipt of any Perks for tax purposes. Indiegogo does not offer any advice or take any responsibility for how Contributors treat their Contributions or for any financial consequences arising out of such treatment.
5. ### Indiegogo’s Role
    
    1. We do not endorse any User Content. Indiegogo provides the platform for creation of Campaigns and interaction of Users. We do not screen Campaigns or endorse any User Content on Our site. Likewise, Indiegogo does not undertake any duty to investigate or guarantee the truthfulness of any claims made by Campaign Owners. You should evaluate a Campaign’s statements before choosing to back the Campaign.
    2. We may remove User Content or cancel Campaigns and refund Contributions in Our discretion. Indiegogo may remove User Content that violates Our Terms of Use in Our sole discretion. Removing User Content, terminating an account, or cancelling Campaigns and refunding Contributions are not actions We take lightly, and We may take a while to investigate and determine if such actions are warranted. It is in Our sole discretion whether to discuss the reasons for taking action against any User Content or account.
    3. We may require you to provide information about your Campaign before disbursing funds. Indiegogo may, but is not required to, request information from you regarding Campaigns. See section 3(j) above for more information.
    4. We do not guarantee Perks or Refunds. Campaign Owners bear sole responsibility for the delivery of Perks and for the offering of any refunds outside Our [Refund Policy](https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526876).
    5. We do not provide tax or legal advice to Users. Users bear sole responsibility for determining how the applicable laws apply to running a Campaign, Contributing to a Campaign, or utilizing any of the Services.
    6. We do not become involved in legal disputes between Users. Indiegogo bears no liability, and has no obligation to investigate, participate, or become involved, in any dispute between Users, including between Contributors and Campaign Owners.
    7. You are responsible for your Campaigns, even if you engage Our help. Indiegogo may offer additional services, including helping with drafting Campaign Content, assisting with the design of Campaigns, and referring vendors and other service providers to Campaign Owners. Any such services will be subject to a separate agreement between the Campaign Owner and Indiegogo. Even where We help with your Campaign, Campaign Owners bear sole responsibility for the Campaign and must comply with all obligations in the Terms as the only responsible party for the Campaign.
6. ### Our Intellectual Property

    We take intellectual property rights very seriously. We comply with intellectual property laws and industry best practices to maintain the integrity of Our Site and Services. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“**_DMCA_**”) sets out the procedure to report notices of alleged copyright infringement. Indiegogo also maintains policies concerning claims of trademark and patent infringement. We will respond to notices of alleged infringement in accordance with the law, as set forth in Our Intellectual Property Policy [here](https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/217205168-Copyright-Trademark-and-Patents). We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to delete or disable User Content that has been alleged to be infringing, as well as to terminate User accounts associated with infringers.

18. ### Legal Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration Will Be Handled In San Francisco, CA and Subject to California Law.
    
    Indiegogo is based in San Francisco, California. For any action not subject to arbitration, you and Indiegogo agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco, CA or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Terms and the relationship between you and Indiegogo shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
    
19. ### Legal Disputes Subject to Arbitration, Dispute Resolution, and Class Action Waiver
    
    **PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**
    
    **You and Indiegogo agree that this arbitration undertaking is made pursuant to or in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq.** **Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.**
    
    **This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to interactions between users); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from this Section are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.**
    
    **By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Indiegogo as follows:**
    
    **_Pre-Arbitration Dispute_** _**Resolution**_ : For any and all disputes, claims, or controversies you may have against Indiegogo (“Disputes”), whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting us through this email address: [support@indiegogo.com](mailto: support@indiegogo.com) with the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the Dispute within forty-five (45) days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue resolution of the Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.
    
    **_Arbitration Procedures_** _:_
    
    If the Dispute has not been resolved and is not subject to the exclusions provided above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve all Disputes, subject to the terms set forth below.
    
    All Disputes shall be resolved before a single arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000, in each case applying the rules and procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. You can find the JAMS rules and procedures [here at this link](https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/).
    
    To start an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (1) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (2) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 2 Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111; and (3) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration to Indiegogo at Corporation Service Company, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento, California 95833-3502, ATTN: Indiegogo, Inc. - Arbitration Demand.
    
    You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Indiegogo will pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.
    
    **_Location of Arbitration_**: If you live in the United States, you may initiate and litigate the arbitration in your hometown area or through the JAMS office located in San Francisco, California. If you live outside the United States, you must initiate and litigate the arbitration through the JAMS office located in San Francisco, California. Either party may ask that the arbitration including the hearings, arguments, and all conferences be conducted telephonically or by video conference (_e.g.,_ Skype).
    
    The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, Additional Policies, or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms, Additional Policies, or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
    
    The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
    
    **CLASS ACTION WAIVER**: **The parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. THIS MEANS THAT YOU AND INDIEGOGO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A LEAD OR REPRESENTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. HOWEVER, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED, UPON REQUEST BY EITHER PARTY, IF SUCH SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S). CONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT ANY AND ALL SEPARATELY INITIATED ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S) ARE ALL HEARD BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. IF EITHER PARTY REQUESTS CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE ARBITRATIONS, THEN THE PARTIES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CASE(S) WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO DESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR AS WELL AS ANY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE OF THE ARBITRATION. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY BE CONSIDERED IN REQUESTING A CONSOLIDATION OF ARBITRATIONS:**
    
    * **The arbitrations have a common question of law or fact;**
    * **The issues in the multiple arbitrations are largely identical;**
    * **There are common claims, disputes, defenses, and relationships between or among the parties in the different arbitrations;**
    * **One or more parties is named in multiple pending arbitrations;**
    * **The arbitrations relate to the same campaign featured on Indiegogo’s platform;**
    * **Consolidation will save time and resources;**
    * **One party will be seriously prejudiced by having multiple arbitrations heard separately.**
    
    **By agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action. We are also waiving these rights.**
    
    **_Exclusions from Arbitration_**: **_Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims_:** Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve Disputes through arbitration, either party may (1) bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to misuse, infringement, or misappropriation of intellectual property theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights); and/or (2) seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
    
    **_30-Day Right to Opt-Out_**_:_ _You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above._ You can opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending an email from your registered email address on Indiegogo to us [here](http://indiegogo.com/contact) with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." To opt-out, you must send the email to Indiegogo with the required language within thirty (30) days of the later of the following: (i) of your creation of an Indiegogo account or your first transaction with Indiegogo, whichever is earlier; or (ii) the date of notice from Indiegogo of a material change to this Section via email to you. To be clear, if you opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provision, you will be able to pursue any potential claims in a court of law **_and_** can participate in a class action or other class proceeding if you so desire. If you do not opt out properly, you agree to arbitrate. If you opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions, we will not be subject to them either with respect to any disputes with you, meaning Indiegogo can also litigate in a court of law and be subject to class action litigation.
    
    **_Severability_**_:_ If a court or arbitrator decides that any portion of this Section regarding Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is invalid or unenforceable, then the portion shall be severed from the Terms and/or deemed modified, only to the extent necessary to make it lawful. Such invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions of the Terms that are not invalid or unenforceable. To affect the modification of the portion, the portion shall be deemed deleted, added to, and/or rewritten, whichever shall most fully preserve the intentions of the parties as originally expressed herein.
    
    The Terms and the relationship between you and Indiegogo shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. This “Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” section shall survive any termination of your account, these Terms, or the Services.
