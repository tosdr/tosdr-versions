* * *

### Profile and Account Termination

You can delete your profile and account at any time unless you have active subscribers as a Star.  
  
We can terminate or suspend your account/profile at any time at our discretion. We can also cancel any pledges and remove any content at our sole discretion with or without prior warning and/or explanation. However, in absolute majority cases, we will contact you prior to the account/profile suspension/termination.  
  
Upon account/profile termination, the following will happen:  
  
**For Subscribers:** all subscriptions will be canceled immediately and no refunds for ongoing subscriptions will be issued whatsoever. Subscribers will retain access to the subscribed material until the end of the subscription period. In order to keep the ability to access subscriptions, Subscribers will need to keep their accounts intact.  
  
**For Stars:** all payouts, if any in progress or available for the request, will be put on hold for 30 calendar days. We use this time to settle all possible requests from the Subscribers for the paybacks and other disputes. In case when conditions for the payout are not met (i.e. less than 5 paid subscribers and less than $50 collected pledges) - all pledges will not be reimbursed to the Star whatsoever and will remain in the Service.  
  
**For both roles:** all financial transactions data and previously filled out tax forms will stay in possession of the respective third parties and/or the Service, for the duration of time outlined by the aforementioned third parties’ “Terms of Service” or similar legal documents.

  

**The reasons for account suspension or termination including, but not limited to, as follows:  
**  

> If a Subscriber's actions or inactions result in a chargeback initiated against the Platform, we may decide to end our relationship with that Subscriber, with or without prior notice. We kindly ask all Subscribers to contact us before calling your bank regarding any concerns related to the subscription payments.

**  
Illegal Activities.** This Service, as well as the company operating this Service, is governed by the laws of the United States of America. Anything that is considered “illegal” by the US law is illegal for use within our platform and will be removed/terminated.  
  
**Bullying.** Any form of abuse, persecution, harassment, attacking or bullying, either directly or by using your influence over others - within this platform or outside with the use of the platform or its parts - will lead to account suspension and investigation, which may result in subsequent profile/account termination.  
  
**Doxing.** It is absolutely forbidden to aggregate and publish on this Platform any private personal or sensitive information of anybody, regardless of the fact if this person is our User or not or reveal the identity of such an individual without the explicit written consent, for the purpose of intimidating aforementioned individual through harassment.  
  
**Private Information Abuse.** Any usage (e.g., sharing, storing, selling) any private information, that became available to the User via this Platform, including, but not limited to, e-mail or home addresses, personal name, and any other data that can be considered “sensitive” or “private”, is strictly prohibited.  
  
**Content Sharing.** Sharing somebody else’s content, that User got access to on this Platform, outside of this Platform without explicit permission from the original content owner is strictly prohibited.

**Miscellaneous Sharing.** Deliberate sharing of any encrypted, private, or other data related to the Service's operations, including but not limited to tokens, cookies, codes, passwords, as well as an unauthorized share of the correspondence between Service and its Users without explicit and direct permission from the Service, will lead to an immediate and permanent ban from the Platform.  
  
**Fraud.** Publishing, endorsing, or selling any fraudulent or misleading information or transmitting any digital substance or a code of a destructive nature on this Platform will lead to investigation and potential permanent termination of the account with the report to the appropriate authorities. While this Service has no intentions to follow, curate, investigate, check up on or make and extensive research on vast information published on the Platform, we will take actions in case the investigation - for one or another reason - is initiated.  
  
**Impersonation.** Presenting yourself as somebody else, especially well known and famous, leads to instant and permanent termination of the account, upon discovery.  
  
**Creating or Distributing Deepfakes.** Generating or disseminating content that alters the identity of individuals in a manner that could mislead users about the authenticity of the content. This includes manipulating voices, images, or videos of celebrities and political figures.  
  
**Identity Manipulation.** Using Artificial Intelligence (aka, “AI”) to modify the appearance, voice, or actions of individuals without explicit consent, thereby potentially infringing on personal rights and privacy.  
  
**Misleading Content.** Publishing any synthetic media that could confuse users regarding the truthfulness of events, statements, or identities. This is particularly critical for content involving public figures and celebrities, where authenticity matters.  
  
**Spam.** A frequent posting of meaningless content - textual or audio/video - will lead to account suspension and investigation, which may result in subsequent account termination. We reserve the right to determine the meaningfulness of the published information.  
  
**Harm to this Service.** Any unfriendly, offensive, obscene, derogatory, degrading remarks, public messages, comments or posts - within this Platform or elsewhere - that aim to offend, slander or attack our good name and reputation, or otherwise bring harm to this Service, the operating Company or its staff, members or partners, will lead to instant and permanent termination of the account, most likely followed by the legal actions against the perpetrator(s).  
  
**Dangerous Activities.** Any User caught in the act or convicted of making credible violent threats, committing violent crimes, child abuse, violence against animals, malicious doxing, coordinating violent or nonviolent harm, participating in civil unrest, or encouraging others to do any of these activities, may be suspended/banned from using this Service. All activities that can put viewers in danger - by action or inaction - must include a clear disclaimer that warns against repeating such stunts.  
  
**Criminal Activities.** People with a proven criminal history or with a known affiliation with violent or dangerous groups (e.g., organized criminal groups, terrorist or cyber-terrorist organizations, illegal militias, mercenary organizations, violent hate groups, etc.), won’t be onboarded and will be terminated upon discovery such activities, without regards to the declared purpose of the corresponding profile.  
  
**Inactivity.** We reserve the right to suspend - with possible following termination, with or without prior notice - any content creator’s account/profile, that was inactive without prior notice - to us or to its Subscribers - for more than 30 days. All recurring billing will be paused. All collected pledges that are subject to payout will be processed within 30 calendar days upon payout request. In case when conditions for the payout are not met - all pledges will not be reimbursed whatsoever and will remain in the Service.  
  
**Deviations.** We reserve the right to suspend - with or without prior warning - any content creator’s account/profile, that displays, hosts or advertises content that is drastically deviated from the type of content approved during the onboarding process.  
  
**Call to Group Actions.** It’s strictly prohibited to ask anyone on the Platform - Subscribers or Stars - to request a refund, unsubscribe, leave Platform or initiate legal action against the Platform or participate in such actions.  
  
**Profile / Account Ghosting.** It’s strictly prohibited to create an account/profile with the same, new, or altered credentials after an initial account/profile by this particular Star/User was terminated, suspended, or otherwise disabled. For instance, if the profile "X" was terminated, it is prohibited to create a new profile "Y" by the same individual, organization, and/or any other associated entity.   
  
**Permanent Absence.** Upon receiving a piece of reliable information about a particular Star being deceased or otherwise permanently had lost the ability to operate this Service, we reserve the following rights:

1. No payout request will be accepted made on behalf of the deceased Star.
2. No payments will be processed toward the subscription or commissions to this profile.
3. The payments made prior to the billing termination are not eligible for refunds.

* * *

### Onboarding Stars

To start posting/publishing on this Platform, you have to become a Star.  
  
We provide our Service only to the Stars whose profiles/accounts are approved.  
  
Before a fully functional version of the Platform is available for your use as a Star, you will need to complete the Sign-Up form. This form must be completed in full, including your actual active e-mail address, secure password, original profile name, reasonable monthly subscription fee, attractive profile avatar, and meaningful profile description.  
  
Upon completion, your application will be reviewed and considered for approval, which may or may not be granted. We may grant approval or refuse to do so, at our sole discretion with or without explanation for each outcome.  
  
We reserve the right to take as much time as needed in order to finish the review process. If you believe your application was rejected by mistake, you can contact our Support Team via e-mail with questions and additional supporting materials or information.  
  
Those profiles that are under review should be expecting fair treatment, but profile owners must release us from any and all obligations with respect to the time that takes to review the profile and conditions that will be applied to the aforementioned review.  
  
After you signed up but before your profile fully approved, you can use Platform with limited features.

* * *

### Relationships between Stars, Subscribers and the Service

> Users who are active on our Platform or elsewhere and who are reluctant to reply to Platform's Support Team inquiries, are subject to the following actions: 
> 
> 1. We reserve the rights to pause billing for such a user (i.e., Star), resulting in the suspension of incoming pledges. 
> 2. If we unsuccessfully attempt to contact a Subscriber who demonstrates proven activity, access to all subscribed content may be restricted for this SubscribeStar user until the issue is resolved.

  
**PAYMENTS' DISPUTES  
**Service provides recourse to cardholders in the event of a dispute concerning payments. Service assumes all liability concerning the payment processing, including maintaining compliance with tax laws and taking steps to prevent fraud. All inquiries concerning payments should be submitted to **[\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**.**  
  
OTHER DISPUTES  
**We do not mediate or arbitrate relationships between Subscribers and Stars, nor do we interfere in any controversy that may derive from such relationships.In case that requires both parties' involvement (i.e., Subscribers and Stars) either should initiate contact with the opponent/proponent by any possible means, avoiding any involvement from our side. If such involvement is unavoidable, we reserve the right to proceed on whatever timeline and with whatever proposition we decide.  
  
In case when you, as a Subscriber or a Star having issues or concerns in regard to provided Services, we encourage you to contact us directly prior to initiating any related discussion online elsewhere.  
  
By agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative proceeding. We, as a Company and as a Service, are also waiving these rights.  
  
For further information, refer to the “Limitation of Liability” and “Indemnity” chapters.

* * *

### Copyright

We do not review, audit, revise, or curate content published on SubscribeStar.com to determine if it is a fair use case (ref. to "Limitations on exclusive rights"), but we will normally remove the reported content if we receive a valid DMCA takedown notice.  
  
If you believe that a content creator on our Service is infringing on your copyright, please send a DMCA takedown notice to [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to have the content removed. This notice must comply with the requirements of section 512(c)(3)(A) of the DMCA. Such notice will be immediately passed on to the content creator responsible for the creating/publishing of the artwork in question.  
  
We are giving the involved content creator 72 hours to handle a DMCA notice on their own before the Service will get directly involved.  
  
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service or any contact on the website through which the Service is provided, without the express written permission by us, unless we stated otherwise.

* * *

### Submissions

If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions (e.g. contest entries, proof of creative body of work, etc.) or without a request from us you send creative ideas, suggestions, proposals, plans, or other materials, whether online, by e-mail, by postal mail, or otherwise (collectively, “comments”), you agree that we may, at any time, without restriction, edit, copy, publish, distribute, translate and otherwise use in any medium any comments that you forward to us. We are and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain any comments in confidence; (2) to pay compensation for any comments; or (3) to respond to any comments.  
  
You are solely responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you or any third-party.

* * *

### Recurring Billing

The subscription mechanism of this Service is based on recurring billing.  
  
The recurring billing is enabled automatically after a Star gets five active Subscribers.  
  
Until then, the existing Subscribers have to manually initiate charge by going to [My Subscriptions](https://www.subscribestar.com/subscriptions) page and hitting the Pay action link found against the name of the Star in question in the Active Subscriptions section.  
  
The exact recurring charge date is not connected to the month's start nor to the end of it, but rather to the moment when subscription event has occurred. The recurring billing date is determined by the Service at our sole discretion. Normally, recurring billing for each subscription runs roughly every 30 calendar days for each subscription instance.  
  
We reserve the right to suspend a recurring billing for the following cases:

* When profile (i.e., Star) is not active for whatever reason for more than 14 days.
* If any activity associated with the account and/or profile are considered suspicious. To determine transactions or activities suspicious, we may take into consideration any data provided to us by third parties or base our decision upon our own internal investigation.

* * *

### Commissions

The Commissions is the form of a one-off pledge, that is dissociated from any subscription tier or subscription fee and can be set as a one-time payment with an arbitrary amount of money, up to $100 at once. Commissions are made for work that is already done or will be done in the future.  
  
Commissions can be made by anybody to the Star who has Commissions feature manually enabled by the Service staff.  
  
We are not obliged to enable the Commissions feature while reserving the right to disable it at any moment.  
  
We take up to 30 calendar days to review Commissions before processing and landing funds to Star’s account.

* * *

### Subscriptions

The subscription fee (i.e., price of monthly subscription) will be charged according to the billing model chosen by the Star and introduced to the Subscriber upon subscription.  
  
The number of payments paid by the Subscriber and the total amount depends on the first date of each billing cycle and settings, whether it should be paid instantly upon subscription or otherwise.  
  
A monthly billing cycle can be defined as 28, 30, or 31 days regardless of the number of days in the following or current calendar month.  
  
When a Subscriber changes the subscription tier, a new subscription is initiated, canceling the initial one. In other words, Subscribers pay as if they subscribe for the first time following the current billing model chosen by the Star.  
  
Every subscription has its own date and time, therefore multiple subscriptions will result in multiple charges, rather than in one batch charge.  
  
Prices for subscriptions are subject to change by Stars without notice. Any further disputes in regard to subscription price changes must be handled by the Subscribers with the Stars (i.e., content providers) directly via available e-mail or direct messaging. Please, refer to our [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
By becoming a Subscriber, you confirm that you use your own payment method that issued in your name and belongs to you. Subsequently, you agree to comply with our payment processors’ rules and regulations in their entirety.  
  
None of the monthly subscriptions can run unverified and without a manual renewal by the Subscribers longer than 365 or 366 days for a leap-year, whichever is applicable.   
  
Every subscription must be reviewed and manually renewed by the associated Subscriber at least once per year. This must be done on or before December 31st, or whenever requested by the Platform.  
   
The renewal is done via mechanism and on a schedule provided by the Platform. Both mechanism and a schedule are unequivocally presented to each active Subscriber within the Platform and are applied to every subscription individually.  
   
The subscriptions will be put on hold until further developments if failed to be renewed in a timely manner. Upon subscription hold being initiated, all associated inbound and outbound funds flow will be stopped.  
  
If and when our attempt to charge the current payment method fails, we will repeat such an attempt within the next few hours. When such attempts are unsuccessful, the selected payment method is deemed faulty and will be marked as such in the Payment Options section of the Account Settings page. To continue with the existing and future subscriptions, you will have to adjust a payment method by adding a previously used but updated credit/debit card. Alternatively, you can add a new card. As soon as this change happens, we will automatically repeat our attempts to charge your updated preferred payment method unless the recurring billing was disabled.  
  
We may, at our sole discretion, limit or cancel subscriptions.

* * *

### Unsubscriptions

The Subscriber can cancel subscription (i.e., unsubscribe) at any time.  
  
Upon unsubscribing from the Star, the Subscriber will lose access to the subscribed materials.  
  
If you believe you deserve a refund for a canceled subscription (i.e., unsubscription), please, refer to our  [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
Upon subscribing again to the same profile - no matter how short the period of time was between unsubscription and re-subscription - the Subscriber will be charged full price for the new subscription according to the subscription price set on the profile.

### Cancellation Policy

1. Subscribers can cancel their subscriptions at any time, either immediately or by scheduling the cancellation for the end of the paid period.
2. If these Terms of Service are violated by the Subscriber, the connected subscription(s) may be put on hold or terminated along with the related Subscriber's account.
3. While Stars can’t delete profiles with paid subscriptions, they may want to schedule such deletions instead. The profile will be deleted on the last day of the paid period, and all related subscriptions will be subsequently canceled.
4. When a refund is issued for a subscription, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. In certain cases, such cancellation might be final and irreversible.
5. When a chargeback is initiated by the Subscriber, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. Such cancellation is final and irreversible.
6. If a Subscriber requests cancellation of the subscription while reaching out via their registered and verified email account, and provides enough information, such subscription might be canceled. Email requests are the only reliable communication accepted for such cases.
7. Subscriptions will be put on pause and potentially canceled if the Subscriber hasn’t paid for the subscription or if the system has failed to charge the related account.
8. If a Subscriber isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Subscriber wasn’t using the subscription, we might cancel such a subscription.
9. If a profile the Subscriber has access to isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Star wasn’t using the Platform, we might cancel such subscription(s).

### Fees for Subscribers

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Subscriber with our Service.   
  
You can cancel your pledge (i.e., subscription) at any time.   
  
As a Subscriber, you will be charged Subscription Fee instantly upon subscription or according to the charging model selected by the Star. Thereafter, this fee will be debited from your preferred payment option on a monthly basis (roughly - every 30 days). Depending on your location, some banks may charge you a Foreign Transaction Fee for your pledge, which will be assessed in addition to the pledge amount.   
  
The Foreign Transaction Fee is subject to change by the authorized institutions without prior notice. We have no control over this charge.   
  
If the Subscriber ordinarily resides in the country or territory that requires collecting VAT, then VAT will be added to the final amount.  
  
The specific VAT amount depends on the country, county, and city of supporters' residences. Supporters will see the exact VAT amount when setting up their initial pledge (i.e., Subscription or Commission).   
  
We reserve the right to modify existing VAT rates or apply VAT to Subscribers' contributions in compliance with relevant tax regulations.   
  
We also reserve the right to deduct the VAT amount from incoming transactions when required.  
  
The Platform collects the necessary taxes and then distributes them in line with the applicable rules and regulations.

* * *

### Fees for Stars

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Star with our Service.  
  
As a Star, you will need to set a Subscription Fee during the registering process. You can change this fee at any time unless you have existing active subscribers. The upper limit for the Subscription Fee is $100.  
  
Payment Processing Fees of 2.9% + $0.3 (3.5% + $0.3 for amounts greater than $30) will be applied to each transaction (i.e., Subscription, Commission) made toward Star's account. This amount will be deducted from the Star's monthly earnings during the Payout.  
  
Additional fees may be associated with the Payout (see “Payouts”).

* * *

### Subscription Tiers

To gradually reward your Subscribers, you can set a few Subscription Tiers, each with a different Subscription Fee.  
  
As a Subscriber, you can switch to a higher (i.e., upgrade) or lower (i.e., downgrade) Subscription Tier at any time, if multiple Subscription Tiers are set by the Star.  
  
While upgrading, the price difference between the Tiers will be debited from the preferred payment method; when downgrading, there won't be any credits issued for the price difference.

> Downgrading will result in instant revocation of access to all content previously available from the higher Tier.

  
Charges and billing date changes, or the absence of such, will be indicated during the upgrade or downgrade, so the Subscriber can make a conscious choice before proceeding with a switch.

* * *

### Payouts

**General Statements**

Payout is a process of sending funds collected on the Star's account to a chosen by this User financial instrument or institution (e.g., bank, eWallet).   
  
The payout can be issued exclusively to a person or organization that is the User who initially registered the account with the Service and who conducts the actual content publishing activities within the Platform.  
  
While in some exceptional cases, the payout can be issued to the payee different than the original User, there is no guarantee we will do that.  
  
We cannot transfer the funds accumulated in one Star's account to another Star's account. If such a transfer was previously requested and executed, and if the sending Star is eligible for a 1099-K, the form will only reflect payments processed for that specific Star. In other words, any transfers from that Star to other content creators will not be included in the 1099-K.  
  
If we deem the information in our possession is insufficient for payout purposes, we may request additional identification or proof of substance from the payee. Such documents may include Driver's License, State ID, National or International Passport, Citizenship, or National ID Card for individuals. And for the organization, the Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of Organization, or any other similar company formation documents may be requested.  
  
These documents are requested by our processing partners, who are subject to regulations by the higher financial authorities of the corresponding countries (e.g., the card brands, banks, NACHA, The Financial Conduct Authority, and similar institutions). The requesting entity checks all received information against Money Laundering Act and other applicable policies.   
  
For the cases when the payout wasn't delivered, we may request proof of such a non-delivery in the form of a bank statement for the related period.  
  
Providing this information may prevent our Users from being flagged as sanctioned individuals or organizations that belong to OFAC list, ones linked to fraud or other unlawful affairs.  
  
A User must meet the following criteria to be eligible for payouts: 

* Active profile (consistently deliver content or service to subscribers).
* Acceptable level of requested refunds (your subscribers shouldn’t have a trend of requesting refunds).
* Acceptable level of chargebacks (not going over 1% of total transactions with initiated chargebacks).
* Submitted and verified Taxpayer Forms (W-9, W-8BEN, or W-8BEN-E, whichever applicable).
* Verified identity if requested (verification depends on a country of residence).
* The payout information is filled out in full and verified.
* A selected Payout Vendor can serve the User in their country of residence.
* The User doesn’t violate the Payout Vendor’s terms of their service.
* A selected Payout Vendor can provide the service of sending funds from the Service’s account.

  
**Additional conditions**

1. The related profile has at least 5 actively paying subscribers (can be subject to change per User request)
2. The profile has at least USD150 in pledges collected (we may apply exceptions for different regions; for example, the limit for creators from the United States can be set to USD30)
3. At least 14 days have passed since the Star's account was initially approved
4. At least 14 days have passed since we successfully processed the previously submitted payout request (we make exceptions per User request and often automatically lower this limit to 7 days)

Star must submit a request on the Payouts page to initiate the payout process.  
  
The exceptions from these conditions can be made upon request sent to [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  
  
We reserve the right to deny or pause payout to any User until the matters in question are resolved, if:

* The User failed to provide us with all required and requested information.
* If the information provided is false, omitted, incomplete, or suspicious in any other way (each as determined by the Service in its sole discretion).
* Whenever requested by the Service, the User failed to prove that all related activity on the Service is lawful, as governed by state or province of residence or by international law. 

  
**Timeframe**

Processing payout and delivering funds to the Star’s bank account will take the time that depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star’s account.

For the very first payout request, or when a payout method was changed or updated, there will be a 5 (five) business days delay from the date these changes took place. We use this time to verify the information associated with the changes/updates.  
  
Payouts of less than USD20,000.00 will be initiated within the next 14 business days (on average it takes about 5 business days), following the day the request was submitted. Business days are counted based on the United States holidays/weekends official calendar as well as payment vendor’s and Star’s side. It may take up to 14 business days for the payout to reach your bank account. Typically for ACH transfers it takes 1-3 business days, and for Wire - 1-10 business days.

We may decide to break down to a few separate payments any payout requests that are equal to or more than USD20,000.00. We take no less than 14 business days to process such batch payment.

> Whenever we detect an increased number of refunds toward a particular Star's profile or identify a risk of such an event happening in the foreseen future, we reserve rights to extend the payout processing period beyond 14 business days.

  
The amount equal to 10% of all funds collected by any particular Star can be held for 30 days without being able to be requested for disbursement if and when:

1. The refund rate related to this Star deemed to be “significant” by the Service
2. The content, advertised and promised to be delivered by this Star has failed to be delivered in a timely manner

To prevent any damages that may occur upon possible chargebacks, the Service may keep 10% of all effectively collected funds, but no less than USD35, for 30 business days before making them available to be included in the payout request.  
  
We reserve the right to take additional unlimited time to process the payout if:

* The User has submitted incorrect, suspicious, or incomplete Taxpayer Identification forms.
* The User has submitted invalid or incomplete payout details.
* Any third-party institution (e.g., bank) or organization (e.g., money transfer service) involved in the payout process fails or delays in making the payment into the User account.
* The User who submitted the payout request isn't the actual owner of the receiving account. 

  
**Limits**

The minimum amount of the payout request is USD150, and the actual limit depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star account. Please contact support to know more about your specific case.

The highest amount requested for the payout cannot be greater than the balance available for the payout. The balance available for the payout is based on the proprietary algorithms of the Service and may change without notice.

  
**Fees**

The User pays all and any fees and taxes associated with receiving money on their account.

The Service takes the rights to deduct from the payouts:

* Service Fee - 5% of all successfully processed pledges, (i.e., subscriptions, commissions) to the date of payout request.
* Payment Processing Fee (typically is 2.9% + USD0.3 per transaction, 3.5% + USD0.3 for transactions over USD30).
* Payout Fees associated with the payout. The exact amount of this fee depends on the payout option selected by the User, current currency exchange rate, fees set by the related payment vendor.
* The total amount of refunded, disputed, incomplete, failed, fraudulent, suspicious payments/transactions or any expenses caused by such events and circumstances.
* Any payments/transactions made by mistake.
* Any pledges that were not deposited on the Service’s bank account for any reason.

>  If your account experiences an excessive payment decline rate, we reserve the right to recover compensation for any associated extra expenses. Typically, if the decline rate exceeds 12%, the associated transaction fees paid by SubscribeStar will be passed on to the platform integrator (profile owner).  
>   
> If the disputes rate associated with your profile exceeds 0.25%, we reserve the right to suspend the billing processing and hold the remaining balance up to 4 months. 

  
If the payout to the content creator fails due to the reasons other than actions or inactions of the Service, we keep the rights to apply the following rules:

1. A subsequent payout request will be possible not earlier than the Service receives funds returned by the Star's bank to its account in full. This time period is usually less than 2 (two) months but is almost never shorter than 2 (two) weeks due to the differences in processing practices of each financial institution involved in such transaction.
2. All fees associated with such transaction will be deducted from the account of corresponding Star.

Per each transaction, Service takes rights to round:

* Referral Associate commission amount.
* Payout amount.
* Service Fee amount.

Round-off error may vary within USD1.00.  
  

**Inactive Stars**

Those content creators who, in the current year:

a) eligible for a payout (i.e., whose payable balance has reached a threshold of USD150);  
  
AND  
  
b) have not requested a payout within 6 (six) consecutive months for any reason, including wrong or missing information on tax forms, missing mailing address, etc., potentially, are subjects to the following:

1. Billing will be paused, which will effectively prevent these Stars from getting new Subscribers.
2. Some fee will be applied monthly, with funds taken from the remaining balance of the corresponding accounts. This fee originates from the fact that we, as a Company, responsible for paying the relevant out-of-pocket costs related to keeping remaining balances in our business bank account.

  
The aforementioned actions aren't applicable if a Star:

1. Informed us about such inactivity beforehand.
2. Joined the Platform between December 1 and December 31 of the current year.

> Funds collected in a Star's account, if not regularly withdrawn, may be subject to automated remittance. This process will distribute portions of the remaining balance to the last known valid payout account of this Star. 

* * *

### Hiatus

Any Star can take a break in activities on the Platform - to go on vacation, take some time off, or leave for hiatus.   
  
We strongly advise any content creator to inform Service about such a break a few days ahead. 

> It is imperative to announce the upcoming vacation a few days prior to leaving via message in a post pinned to Star's profile on SubscribeStar.

  
When Star leaves for hiatus, and it takes significantly more time than this Star has informed us about before leaving, the following happens:

1. All payouts - if any were in progress or initiated during this hiatus - could be put on hold, to be resumed in 30 calendar days automatically.
2. Recurring billing will be paused until Star returns from the break and informs us about it via [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Star can request a payout while being on longer-than-expected leave. 

* * *

### Dissolution of the Company

In the unlikely event that SubscribeStar is dissolved or ceases operations, the following terms will apply to all content creators (i.e., Stars) with an outstanding balance on their account:

1. **Notification of Dissolution**  
    SubscribeStar will notify all Stars via their registered email addresses and through an announcement on the Platform regarding the dissolution.

    \- Stars will have 90 days from the date of the dissolution notice to request a payout of their remaining balance.  
    \- Payout requests must be submitted through the usual payout request procedure (i.e., via the “Payouts” page).
3. **Forfeiture of Unclaimed Balances**  
    \- If a Star does not request a payout within the 90-day period, their remaining balance will be permanently forfeited.  
    \- After the 90-day period, SubscribeStar will retain all unclaimed balances, and these funds will no longer be available for payout.
4. **Provision of Remittance Details**  
    If the Platform doesn’t have available options for paying out the remaining balance to a specific content creator, the content creator must provide their details for remittance via options described in the Notification of Dissolution within 30 days after the public announcement of the dissolution. Failure to do so may result in the inability to remit the remaining balance.
5. **Finality and Waiver of Claims**  
    \- Stars acknowledge and agree that after the 90-day payout request period, they will have no further claim to any balances that were not requested within the designated period.  
    \- By continuing to use the Platform, Stars agree to waive any future claims or legal actions against SubscribeStar regarding unclaimed balances post-dissolution.

  
By using SubscribeStar, Stars agree to these terms in the event of the Company's dissolution and understand the importance of timely action to request payouts within the specified period.

* * *

### Profile and Account Termination

You can delete your profile and account at any time unless you have active subscribers as a Star.  
  
We can terminate or suspend your account/profile at any time at our discretion. We can also cancel any pledges and remove any content at our sole discretion with or without prior warning and/or explanation. However, in absolute majority cases, we will contact you prior to the account/profile suspension/termination.  
  
Upon account/profile termination, the following will happen:  
  
**For Subscribers:** all subscriptions will be canceled immediately and no refunds for ongoing subscriptions will be issued whatsoever. Subscribers will retain access to the subscribed material until the end of the subscription period. In order to keep the ability to access subscriptions, Subscribers will need to keep their accounts intact.  
  
**For Stars:** all payouts, if any in progress or available for the request, will be put on hold for 30 calendar days. We use this time to settle all possible requests from the Subscribers for the paybacks and other disputes. In case when conditions for the payout are not met (i.e. less than 5 paid subscribers and less than $50 collected pledges) - all pledges will not be reimbursed to the Star whatsoever and will remain in the Service.  
  
**For both roles:** all financial transactions data and previously filled out tax forms will stay in possession of the respective third parties and/or the Service, for the duration of time outlined by the aforementioned third parties’ “Terms of Service” or similar legal documents.

  

**The reasons for account suspension or termination including, but not limited to, as follows:  
**  

> If a Subscriber's actions or inactions result in a chargeback initiated against the Platform, we may decide to end our relationship with that Subscriber, with or without prior notice. We kindly ask all Subscribers to contact us before calling your bank regarding any concerns related to the subscription payments.

**  
Illegal Activities.** This Service, as well as the company operating this Service, is governed by the laws of the United States of America. Anything that is considered “illegal” by the US law is illegal for use within our platform and will be removed/terminated.  
  
**Bullying.** Any form of abuse, persecution, harassment, attacking or bullying, either directly or by using your influence over others - within this platform or outside with the use of the platform or its parts - will lead to account suspension and investigation, which may result in subsequent profile/account termination.  
  
**Doxing.** It is absolutely forbidden to aggregate and publish on this Platform any private personal or sensitive information of anybody, regardless of the fact if this person is our User or not or reveal the identity of such an individual without the explicit written consent, for the purpose of intimidating aforementioned individual through harassment.  
  
**Private Information Abuse.** Any usage (e.g., sharing, storing, selling) any private information, that became available to the User via this Platform, including, but not limited to, e-mail or home addresses, personal name, and any other data that can be considered “sensitive” or “private”, is strictly prohibited.  
  
**Content Sharing.** Sharing somebody else’s content, that User got access to on this Platform, outside of this Platform without explicit permission from the original content owner is strictly prohibited.

**Miscellaneous Sharing.** Deliberate sharing of any encrypted, private, or other data related to the Service's operations, including but not limited to tokens, cookies, codes, passwords, as well as an unauthorized share of the correspondence between Service and its Users without explicit and direct permission from the Service, will lead to an immediate and permanent ban from the Platform.  
  
**Fraud.** Publishing, endorsing, or selling any fraudulent or misleading information or transmitting any digital substance or a code of a destructive nature on this Platform will lead to investigation and potential permanent termination of the account with the report to the appropriate authorities. While this Service has no intentions to follow, curate, investigate, check up on or make and extensive research on vast information published on the Platform, we will take actions in case the investigation - for one or another reason - is initiated.  
  
**Impersonation.** Presenting yourself as somebody else, especially well known and famous, leads to instant and permanent termination of the account, upon discovery.  
  
**Creating or Distributing Deepfakes.** Generating or disseminating content that alters the identity of individuals in a manner that could mislead users about the authenticity of the content. This includes manipulating voices, images, or videos of celebrities and political figures.  
  
**Identity Manipulation.** Using Artificial Intelligence (aka, “AI”) to modify the appearance, voice, or actions of individuals without explicit consent, thereby potentially infringing on personal rights and privacy.  
  
**Misleading Content.** Publishing any synthetic media that could confuse users regarding the truthfulness of events, statements, or identities. This is particularly critical for content involving public figures and celebrities, where authenticity matters.  
  
**Spam.** A frequent posting of meaningless content - textual or audio/video - will lead to account suspension and investigation, which may result in subsequent account termination. We reserve the right to determine the meaningfulness of the published information.  
  
**Harm to this Service.** Any unfriendly, offensive, obscene, derogatory, degrading remarks, public messages, comments or posts - within this Platform or elsewhere - that aim to offend, slander or attack our good name and reputation, or otherwise bring harm to this Service, the operating Company or its staff, members or partners, will lead to instant and permanent termination of the account, most likely followed by the legal actions against the perpetrator(s).  
  
**Dangerous Activities.** Any User caught in the act or convicted of making credible violent threats, committing violent crimes, child abuse, violence against animals, malicious doxing, coordinating violent or nonviolent harm, participating in civil unrest, or encouraging others to do any of these activities, may be suspended/banned from using this Service. All activities that can put viewers in danger - by action or inaction - must include a clear disclaimer that warns against repeating such stunts.  
  
**Criminal Activities.** People with a proven criminal history or with a known affiliation with violent or dangerous groups (e.g., organized criminal groups, terrorist or cyber-terrorist organizations, illegal militias, mercenary organizations, violent hate groups, etc.), won’t be onboarded and will be terminated upon discovery such activities, without regards to the declared purpose of the corresponding profile.  
  
**Inactivity.** We reserve the right to suspend - with possible following termination, with or without prior notice - any content creator’s account/profile, that was inactive without prior notice - to us or to its Subscribers - for more than 30 days. All recurring billing will be paused. All collected pledges that are subject to payout will be processed within 30 calendar days upon payout request. In case when conditions for the payout are not met - all pledges will not be reimbursed whatsoever and will remain in the Service.  
  
**Deviations.** We reserve the right to suspend - with or without prior warning - any content creator’s account/profile, that displays, hosts or advertises content that is drastically deviated from the type of content approved during the onboarding process.  
  
**Call to Group Actions.** It’s strictly prohibited to ask anyone on the Platform - Subscribers or Stars - to request a refund, unsubscribe, leave Platform or initiate legal action against the Platform or participate in such actions.  
  
**Profile / Account Ghosting.** It’s strictly prohibited to create an account/profile with the same, new, or altered credentials after an initial account/profile by this particular Star/User was terminated, suspended, or otherwise disabled. For instance, if the profile "X" was terminated, it is prohibited to create a new profile "Y" by the same individual, organization, and/or any other associated entity.   
  
**Permanent Absence.** Upon receiving a piece of reliable information about a particular Star being deceased or otherwise permanently had lost the ability to operate this Service, we reserve the following rights:

1. No payout request will be accepted made on behalf of the deceased Star.
2. No payments will be processed toward the subscription or commissions to this profile.
3. The payments made prior to the billing termination are not eligible for refunds.

### Onboarding Stars

To start posting/publishing on this Platform, you have to become a Star.  
  
We provide our Service only to the Stars whose profiles/accounts are approved.  
  
Before a fully functional version of the Platform is available for your use as a Star, you will need to complete the Sign-Up form. This form must be completed in full, including your actual active e-mail address, secure password, original profile name, reasonable monthly subscription fee, attractive profile avatar, and meaningful profile description.  
  
Upon completion, your application will be reviewed and considered for approval, which may or may not be granted. We may grant approval or refuse to do so, at our sole discretion with or without explanation for each outcome.  
  
We reserve the right to take as much time as needed in order to finish the review process. If you believe your application was rejected by mistake, you can contact our Support Team via e-mail with questions and additional supporting materials or information.  
  
Those profiles that are under review should be expecting fair treatment, but profile owners must release us from any and all obligations with respect to the time that takes to review the profile and conditions that will be applied to the aforementioned review.  
  
After you signed up but before your profile fully approved, you can use Platform with limited features.

* * *

### Relationships between Stars, Subscribers and the Service

> Users who are active on our Platform or elsewhere and who are reluctant to reply to Platform's Support Team inquiries, are subject to the following actions: 
> 
> 1. We reserve the rights to pause billing for such a user (i.e., Star), resulting in the suspension of incoming pledges. 
> 2. If we unsuccessfully attempt to contact a Subscriber who demonstrates proven activity, access to all subscribed content may be restricted for this SubscribeStar user until the issue is resolved.

  
**PAYMENTS' DISPUTES  
**Service provides recourse to cardholders in the event of a dispute concerning payments. Service assumes all liability concerning the payment processing, including maintaining compliance with tax laws and taking steps to prevent fraud. All inquiries concerning payments should be submitted to **[\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**.**  
  
OTHER DISPUTES  
**We do not mediate or arbitrate relationships between Subscribers and Stars, nor do we interfere in any controversy that may derive from such relationships.In case that requires both parties' involvement (i.e., Subscribers and Stars) either should initiate contact with the opponent/proponent by any possible means, avoiding any involvement from our side. If such involvement is unavoidable, we reserve the right to proceed on whatever timeline and with whatever proposition we decide.  
  
In case when you, as a Subscriber or a Star having issues or concerns in regard to provided Services, we encourage you to contact us directly prior to initiating any related discussion online elsewhere.  
  
By agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative proceeding. We, as a Company and as a Service, are also waiving these rights.  
  
For further information, refer to the “Limitation of Liability” and “Indemnity” chapters.

* * *

### Copyright

We do not review, audit, revise, or curate content published on SubscribeStar.com to determine if it is a fair use case (ref. to "Limitations on exclusive rights"), but we will normally remove the reported content if we receive a valid DMCA takedown notice.  
  
If you believe that a content creator on our Service is infringing on your copyright, please send a DMCA takedown notice to [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to have the content removed. This notice must comply with the requirements of section 512(c)(3)(A) of the DMCA. Such notice will be immediately passed on to the content creator responsible for the creating/publishing of the artwork in question.  
  
We are giving the involved content creator 72 hours to handle a DMCA notice on their own before the Service will get directly involved.  
  
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service or any contact on the website through which the Service is provided, without the express written permission by us, unless we stated otherwise.

* * *

### Submissions

If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions (e.g. contest entries, proof of creative body of work, etc.) or without a request from us you send creative ideas, suggestions, proposals, plans, or other materials, whether online, by e-mail, by postal mail, or otherwise (collectively, “comments”), you agree that we may, at any time, without restriction, edit, copy, publish, distribute, translate and otherwise use in any medium any comments that you forward to us. We are and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain any comments in confidence; (2) to pay compensation for any comments; or (3) to respond to any comments.  
  
You are solely responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you or any third-party.

* * *

### Recurring Billing

The subscription mechanism of this Service is based on recurring billing.  
  
The recurring billing is enabled automatically after a Star gets five active Subscribers.  
  
Until then, the existing Subscribers have to manually initiate charge by going to [My Subscriptions](https://www.subscribestar.com/subscriptions) page and hitting the Pay action link found against the name of the Star in question in the Active Subscriptions section.  
  
The exact recurring charge date is not connected to the month's start nor to the end of it, but rather to the moment when subscription event has occurred. The recurring billing date is determined by the Service at our sole discretion. Normally, recurring billing for each subscription runs roughly every 30 calendar days for each subscription instance.  
  
We reserve the right to suspend a recurring billing for the following cases:

* When profile (i.e., Star) is not active for whatever reason for more than 14 days.
* If any activity associated with the account and/or profile are considered suspicious. To determine transactions or activities suspicious, we may take into consideration any data provided to us by third parties or base our decision upon our own internal investigation.

* * *

### Commissions

The Commissions is the form of a one-off pledge, that is dissociated from any subscription tier or subscription fee and can be set as a one-time payment with an arbitrary amount of money, up to $100 at once. Commissions are made for work that is already done or will be done in the future.  
  
Commissions can be made by anybody to the Star who has Commissions feature manually enabled by the Service staff.  
  
We are not obliged to enable the Commissions feature while reserving the right to disable it at any moment.  
  
We take up to 30 calendar days to review Commissions before processing and landing funds to Star’s account.

* * *

### Subscriptions

The subscription fee (i.e., price of monthly subscription) will be charged according to the billing model chosen by the Star and introduced to the Subscriber upon subscription.  
  
The number of payments paid by the Subscriber and the total amount depends on the first date of each billing cycle and settings, whether it should be paid instantly upon subscription or otherwise.  
  
A monthly billing cycle can be defined as 28, 30, or 31 days regardless of the number of days in the following or current calendar month.  
  
When a Subscriber changes the subscription tier, a new subscription is initiated, canceling the initial one. In other words, Subscribers pay as if they subscribe for the first time following the current billing model chosen by the Star.  
  
Every subscription has its own date and time, therefore multiple subscriptions will result in multiple charges, rather than in one batch charge.  
  
Prices for subscriptions are subject to change by Stars without notice. Any further disputes in regard to subscription price changes must be handled by the Subscribers with the Stars (i.e., content providers) directly via available e-mail or direct messaging. Please, refer to our [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
By becoming a Subscriber, you confirm that you use your own payment method that issued in your name and belongs to you. Subsequently, you agree to comply with our payment processors’ rules and regulations in their entirety.  
  
None of the monthly subscriptions can run unverified and without a manual renewal by the Subscribers longer than 365 or 366 days for a leap-year, whichever is applicable.   
  
Every subscription must be reviewed and manually renewed by the associated Subscriber at least once per year. This must be done on or before December 31st, or whenever requested by the Platform.  
   
The renewal is done via mechanism and on a schedule provided by the Platform. Both mechanism and a schedule are unequivocally presented to each active Subscriber within the Platform and are applied to every subscription individually.  
   
The subscriptions will be put on hold until further developments if failed to be renewed in a timely manner. Upon subscription hold being initiated, all associated inbound and outbound funds flow will be stopped.  
  
If and when our attempt to charge the current payment method fails, we will repeat such an attempt within the next few hours. When such attempts are unsuccessful, the selected payment method is deemed faulty and will be marked as such in the Payment Options section of the Account Settings page. To continue with the existing and future subscriptions, you will have to adjust a payment method by adding a previously used but updated credit/debit card. Alternatively, you can add a new card. As soon as this change happens, we will automatically repeat our attempts to charge your updated preferred payment method unless the recurring billing was disabled.  
  
We may, at our sole discretion, limit or cancel subscriptions.

* * *

### Unsubscriptions

The Subscriber can cancel subscription (i.e., unsubscribe) at any time.  
  
Upon unsubscribing from the Star, the Subscriber will lose access to the subscribed materials.  
  
If you believe you deserve a refund for a canceled subscription (i.e., unsubscription), please, refer to our  [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
Upon subscribing again to the same profile - no matter how short the period of time was between unsubscription and re-subscription - the Subscriber will be charged full price for the new subscription according to the subscription price set on the profile.

* * *

### Cancellation Policy

1. Subscribers can cancel their subscriptions at any time, either immediately or by scheduling the cancellation for the end of the paid period.
2. If these Terms of Service are violated by the Subscriber, the connected subscription(s) may be put on hold or terminated along with the related Subscriber's account.
3. While Stars can’t delete profiles with paid subscriptions, they may want to schedule such deletions instead. The profile will be deleted on the last day of the paid period, and all related subscriptions will be subsequently canceled.
4. When a refund is issued for a subscription, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. In certain cases, such cancellation might be final and irreversible.
5. When a chargeback is initiated by the Subscriber, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. Such cancellation is final and irreversible.
6. If a Subscriber requests cancellation of the subscription while reaching out via their registered and verified email account, and provides enough information, such subscription might be canceled. Email requests are the only reliable communication accepted for such cases.
7. Subscriptions will be put on pause and potentially canceled if the Subscriber hasn’t paid for the subscription or if the system has failed to charge the related account.
8. If a Subscriber isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Subscriber wasn’t using the subscription, we might cancel such a subscription.
9. If a profile the Subscriber has access to isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Star wasn’t using the Platform, we might cancel such subscription(s).

### Fees for Subscribers

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Subscriber with our Service.   
  
You can cancel your pledge (i.e., subscription) at any time.   
  
As a Subscriber, you will be charged Subscription Fee instantly upon subscription or according to the charging model selected by the Star. Thereafter, this fee will be debited from your preferred payment option on a monthly basis (roughly - every 30 days). Depending on your location, some banks may charge you a Foreign Transaction Fee for your pledge, which will be assessed in addition to the pledge amount.   
  
The Foreign Transaction Fee is subject to change by the authorized institutions without prior notice. We have no control over this charge.   
  
If the Subscriber ordinarily resides in the country or territory that requires collecting VAT, then VAT will be added to the final amount.  
  
The specific VAT amount depends on the country, county, and city of supporters' residences. Supporters will see the exact VAT amount when setting up their initial pledge (i.e., Subscription or Commission).   
  
We reserve the right to modify existing VAT rates or apply VAT to Subscribers' contributions in compliance with relevant tax regulations.   
  
We also reserve the right to deduct the VAT amount from incoming transactions when required.  
  
The Platform collects the necessary taxes and then distributes them in line with the applicable rules and regulations.

* * *

### Fees for Stars

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Star with our Service.  
  
As a Star, you will need to set a Subscription Fee during the registering process. You can change this fee at any time unless you have existing active subscribers. The upper limit for the Subscription Fee is $100.  
  
Payment Processing Fees of 2.9% + $0.3 (3.5% + $0.3 for amounts greater than $30) will be applied to each transaction (i.e., Subscription, Commission) made toward Star's account. This amount will be deducted from the Star's monthly earnings during the Payout.  
  
Additional fees may be associated with the Payout (see “Payouts”).

* * *

### Subscription Tiers

To gradually reward your Subscribers, you can set a few Subscription Tiers, each with a different Subscription Fee.  
  
As a Subscriber, you can switch to a higher (i.e., upgrade) or lower (i.e., downgrade) Subscription Tier at any time, if multiple Subscription Tiers are set by the Star.  
  
While upgrading, the price difference between the Tiers will be debited from the preferred payment method; when downgrading, there won't be any credits issued for the price difference.

> Downgrading will result in instant revocation of access to all content previously available from the higher Tier.

  
Charges and billing date changes, or the absence of such, will be indicated during the upgrade or downgrade, so the Subscriber can make a conscious choice before proceeding with a switch.

* * *

### Payouts

**General Statements**

Payout is a process of sending funds collected on the Star's account to a chosen by this User financial instrument or institution (e.g., bank, eWallet).   
  
The payout can be issued exclusively to a person or organization that is the User who initially registered the account with the Service and who conducts the actual content publishing activities within the Platform.  
  
While in some exceptional cases, the payout can be issued to the payee different than the original User, there is no guarantee we will do that.  
  
We cannot transfer the funds accumulated in one Star's account to another Star's account. If such a transfer was previously requested and executed, and if the sending Star is eligible for a 1099-K, the form will only reflect payments processed for that specific Star. In other words, any transfers from that Star to other content creators will not be included in the 1099-K.  
  
If we deem the information in our possession is insufficient for payout purposes, we may request additional identification or proof of substance from the payee. Such documents may include Driver's License, State ID, National or International Passport, Citizenship, or National ID Card for individuals. And for the organization, the Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of Organization, or any other similar company formation documents may be requested.  
  
These documents are requested by our processing partners, who are subject to regulations by the higher financial authorities of the corresponding countries (e.g., the card brands, banks, NACHA, The Financial Conduct Authority, and similar institutions). The requesting entity checks all received information against Money Laundering Act and other applicable policies.   
  
For the cases when the payout wasn't delivered, we may request proof of such a non-delivery in the form of a bank statement for the related period.  
  
Providing this information may prevent our Users from being flagged as sanctioned individuals or organizations that belong to OFAC list, ones linked to fraud or other unlawful affairs.  
  
A User must meet the following criteria to be eligible for payouts: 

* Active profile (consistently deliver content or service to subscribers).
* Acceptable level of requested refunds (your subscribers shouldn’t have a trend of requesting refunds).
* Acceptable level of chargebacks (not going over 1% of total transactions with initiated chargebacks).
* Submitted and verified Taxpayer Forms (W-9, W-8BEN, or W-8BEN-E, whichever applicable).
* Verified identity if requested (verification depends on a country of residence).
* The payout information is filled out in full and verified.
* A selected Payout Vendor can serve the User in their country of residence.
* The User doesn’t violate the Payout Vendor’s terms of their service.
* A selected Payout Vendor can provide the service of sending funds from the Service’s account.

  
**Additional conditions**

1. The related profile has at least 5 actively paying subscribers (can be subject to change per User request)
2. The profile has at least USD150 in pledges collected (we may apply exceptions for different regions; for example, the limit for creators from the United States can be set to USD30)
3. At least 14 days have passed since the Star's account was initially approved
4. At least 14 days have passed since we successfully processed the previously submitted payout request (we make exceptions per User request and often automatically lower this limit to 7 days)

Star must submit a request on the Payouts page to initiate the payout process.  
  
The exceptions from these conditions can be made upon request sent to [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  
  
We reserve the right to deny or pause payout to any User until the matters in question are resolved, if:

* The User failed to provide us with all required and requested information.
* If the information provided is false, omitted, incomplete, or suspicious in any other way (each as determined by the Service in its sole discretion).
* Whenever requested by the Service, the User failed to prove that all related activity on the Service is lawful, as governed by state or province of residence or by international law. 

  
**Timeframe**

Processing payout and delivering funds to the Star’s bank account will take the time that depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star’s account.

For the very first payout request, or when a payout method was changed or updated, there will be a 5 (five) business days delay from the date these changes took place. We use this time to verify the information associated with the changes/updates.  
  
Payouts of less than USD20,000.00 will be initiated within the next 14 business days (on average it takes about 5 business days), following the day the request was submitted. Business days are counted based on the United States holidays/weekends official calendar as well as payment vendor’s and Star’s side. It may take up to 14 business days for the payout to reach your bank account. Typically for ACH transfers it takes 1-3 business days, and for Wire - 1-10 business days.

We may decide to break down to a few separate payments any payout requests that are equal to or more than USD20,000.00. We take no less than 14 business days to process such batch payment.

> Whenever we detect an increased number of refunds toward a particular Star's profile or identify a risk of such an event happening in the foreseen future, we reserve rights to extend the payout processing period beyond 14 business days.

  
The amount equal to 10% of all funds collected by any particular Star can be held for 30 days without being able to be requested for disbursement if and when:

1. The refund rate related to this Star deemed to be “significant” by the Service
2. The content, advertised and promised to be delivered by this Star has failed to be delivered in a timely manner

To prevent any damages that may occur upon possible chargebacks, the Service may keep 10% of all effectively collected funds, but no less than USD35, for 30 business days before making them available to be included in the payout request.  
  
We reserve the right to take additional unlimited time to process the payout if:

* The User has submitted incorrect, suspicious, or incomplete Taxpayer Identification forms.
* The User has submitted invalid or incomplete payout details.
* Any third-party institution (e.g., bank) or organization (e.g., money transfer service) involved in the payout process fails or delays in making the payment into the User account.
* The User who submitted the payout request isn't the actual owner of the receiving account. 

  
**Limits**

The minimum amount of the payout request is USD150, and the actual limit depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star account. Please contact support to know more about your specific case.

The highest amount requested for the payout cannot be greater than the balance available for the payout. The balance available for the payout is based on the proprietary algorithms of the Service and may change without notice.

  
**Fees**

The User pays all and any fees and taxes associated with receiving money on their account.

The Service takes the rights to deduct from the payouts:

* Service Fee - 5% of all successfully processed pledges, (i.e., subscriptions, commissions) to the date of payout request.
* Payment Processing Fee (typically is 2.9% + USD0.3 per transaction, 3.5% + USD0.3 for transactions over USD30).
* Payout Fees associated with the payout. The exact amount of this fee depends on the payout option selected by the User, current currency exchange rate, fees set by the related payment vendor.
* The total amount of refunded, disputed, incomplete, failed, fraudulent, suspicious payments/transactions or any expenses caused by such events and circumstances.
* Any payments/transactions made by mistake.
* Any pledges that were not deposited on the Service’s bank account for any reason.

>  If your account experiences an excessive payment decline rate, we reserve the right to recover compensation for any associated extra expenses. Typically, if the decline rate exceeds 12%, the associated transaction fees paid by SubscribeStar will be passed on to the platform integrator (profile owner).  
>   
> If the disputes rate associated with your profile exceeds 0.25%, we reserve the right to suspend the billing processing and hold the remaining balance up to 4 months. 

  
If the payout to the content creator fails due to the reasons other than actions or inactions of the Service, we keep the rights to apply the following rules:

1. A subsequent payout request will be possible not earlier than the Service receives funds returned by the Star's bank to its account in full. This time period is usually less than 2 (two) months but is almost never shorter than 2 (two) weeks due to the differences in processing practices of each financial institution involved in such transaction.
2. All fees associated with such transaction will be deducted from the account of corresponding Star.

Per each transaction, Service takes rights to round:

* Referral Associate commission amount.
* Payout amount.
* Service Fee amount.

Round-off error may vary within USD1.00.  
  

**Inactive Stars**

Those content creators who, in the current year:

a) eligible for a payout (i.e., whose payable balance has reached a threshold of USD150);  
  
AND  
  
b) have not requested a payout within 6 (six) consecutive months for any reason, including wrong or missing information on tax forms, missing mailing address, etc., potentially, are subjects to the following:

1. Billing will be paused, which will effectively prevent these Stars from getting new Subscribers.
2. Some fee will be applied monthly, with funds taken from the remaining balance of the corresponding accounts. This fee originates from the fact that we, as a Company, responsible for paying the relevant out-of-pocket costs related to keeping remaining balances in our business bank account.

  
The aforementioned actions aren't applicable if a Star:

1. Informed us about such inactivity beforehand.
2. Joined the Platform between December 1 and December 31 of the current year.

> Funds collected in a Star's account, if not regularly withdrawn, may be subject to automated remittance. This process will distribute portions of the remaining balance to the last known valid payout account of this Star. 

* * *

### Hiatus

Any Star can take a break in activities on the Platform - to go on vacation, take some time off, or leave for hiatus.   
  
We strongly advise any content creator to inform Service about such a break a few days ahead. 

> It is imperative to announce the upcoming vacation a few days prior to leaving via message in a post pinned to Star's profile on SubscribeStar.

  
When Star leaves for hiatus, and it takes significantly more time than this Star has informed us about before leaving, the following happens:

1. All payouts - if any were in progress or initiated during this hiatus - could be put on hold, to be resumed in 30 calendar days automatically.
2. Recurring billing will be paused until Star returns from the break and informs us about it via [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Star can request a payout while being on longer-than-expected leave. 

* * *

1. **Notification of Dissolution**

    \- Stars will have 90 days from the date of the dissolution notice to request a payout of their remaining balance.  
    \- Payout requests must be submitted through the usual payout request procedure (i.e., via the “Payouts” page).
3. **Forfeiture of Unclaimed Balances**  
    \- If a Star does not request a payout within the 90-day period, their remaining balance will be permanently forfeited.  
    \- After the 90-day period, SubscribeStar will retain all unclaimed balances, and these funds will no longer be available for payout.
4. **Provision of Remittance Details**  
    If the Platform doesn’t have available options for paying out the remaining balance to a specific content creator, the content creator must provide their details for remittance via options described in the Notification of Dissolution within 30 days after the public announcement of the dissolution. Failure to do so may result in the inability to remit the remaining balance.
5. **Finality and Waiver of Claims**  
    \- Stars acknowledge and agree that after the 90-day payout request period, they will have no further claim to any balances that were not requested within the designated period.  
    \- By continuing to use the Platform, Stars agree to waive any future claims or legal actions against SubscribeStar regarding unclaimed balances post-dissolution.

  
By using SubscribeStar, Stars agree to these terms in the event of the Company's dissolution and understand the importance of timely action to request payouts within the specified period.

* * *

### Profile and Account Termination

You can delete your profile and account at any time unless you have active subscribers as a Star.  
  
We can terminate or suspend your account/profile at any time at our discretion. We can also cancel any pledges and remove any content at our sole discretion with or without prior warning and/or explanation. However, in absolute majority cases, we will contact you prior to the account/profile suspension/termination.  
  
Upon account/profile termination, the following will happen:  
  
**For Subscribers:** all subscriptions will be canceled immediately and no refunds for ongoing subscriptions will be issued whatsoever. Subscribers will retain access to the subscribed material until the end of the subscription period. In order to keep the ability to access subscriptions, Subscribers will need to keep their accounts intact.  
  
**For Stars:** all payouts, if any in progress or available for the request, will be put on hold for 30 calendar days. We use this time to settle all possible requests from the Subscribers for the paybacks and other disputes. In case when conditions for the payout are not met (i.e. less than 5 paid subscribers and less than $50 collected pledges) - all pledges will not be reimbursed to the Star whatsoever and will remain in the Service.  
  
**For both roles:** all financial transactions data and previously filled out tax forms will stay in possession of the respective third parties and/or the Service, for the duration of time outlined by the aforementioned third parties’ “Terms of Service” or similar legal documents.

  

**The reasons for account suspension or termination including, but not limited to, as follows:  
**  

> If a Subscriber's actions or inactions result in a chargeback initiated against the Platform, we may decide to end our relationship with that Subscriber, with or without prior notice. We kindly ask all Subscribers to contact us before calling your bank regarding any concerns related to the subscription payments.

**  
Illegal Activities.** This Service, as well as the company operating this Service, is governed by the laws of the United States of America. Anything that is considered “illegal” by the US law is illegal for use within our platform and will be removed/terminated.  
  
**Bullying.** Any form of abuse, persecution, harassment, attacking or bullying, either directly or by using your influence over others - within this platform or outside with the use of the platform or its parts - will lead to account suspension and investigation, which may result in subsequent profile/account termination.  
  
**Doxing.** It is absolutely forbidden to aggregate and publish on this Platform any private personal or sensitive information of anybody, regardless of the fact if this person is our User or not or reveal the identity of such an individual without the explicit written consent, for the purpose of intimidating aforementioned individual through harassment.  
  
**Private Information Abuse.** Any usage (e.g., sharing, storing, selling) any private information, that became available to the User via this Platform, including, but not limited to, e-mail or home addresses, personal name, and any other data that can be considered “sensitive” or “private”, is strictly prohibited.  
  
**Content Sharing.** Sharing somebody else’s content, that User got access to on this Platform, outside of this Platform without explicit permission from the original content owner is strictly prohibited.

**Miscellaneous Sharing.** Deliberate sharing of any encrypted, private, or other data related to the Service's operations, including but not limited to tokens, cookies, codes, passwords, as well as an unauthorized share of the correspondence between Service and its Users without explicit and direct permission from the Service, will lead to an immediate and permanent ban from the Platform.  
  
**Fraud.** Publishing, endorsing, or selling any fraudulent or misleading information or transmitting any digital substance or a code of a destructive nature on this Platform will lead to investigation and potential permanent termination of the account with the report to the appropriate authorities.

**Impersonation.** Presenting yourself as somebody else, especially well known and famous, leads to instant and permanent termination of the account, upon discovery.  
  
**Creating or Distributing Deepfakes.** Generating or disseminating content that alters the identity of individuals in a manner that could mislead users about the authenticity of the content. This includes manipulating voices, images, or videos of celebrities and political figures.  
  
**Identity Manipulation.** Using Artificial Intelligence (aka, “AI”) to modify the appearance, voice, or actions of individuals without explicit consent, thereby potentially infringing on personal rights and privacy.  
  
**Misleading Content.** Publishing any synthetic media that could confuse users regarding the truthfulness of events, statements, or identities. This is particularly critical for content involving public figures and celebrities, where authenticity matters.  
  
**Spam.** A frequent posting of meaningless content - textual or audio/video - will lead to account suspension and investigation, which may result in subsequent account termination. We reserve the right to determine the meaningfulness of the published information.  
  
**Harm to this Service.** Any unfriendly, offensive, obscene, derogatory, degrading remarks, public messages, comments or posts - within this Platform or elsewhere - that aim to offend, slander or attack our good name and reputation, or otherwise bring harm to this Service, the operating Company or its staff, members or partners, will lead to instant and permanent termination of the account, most likely followed by the legal actions against the perpetrator(s).  
  
**Dangerous Activities.** Any User caught in the act or convicted of making credible violent threats, committing violent crimes, child abuse, violence against animals, malicious doxing, coordinating violent or nonviolent harm, participating in civil unrest, or encouraging others to do any of these activities, may be suspended/banned from using this Service. All activities that can put viewers in danger - by action or inaction - must include a clear disclaimer that warns against repeating such stunts.  
  
**Criminal Activities.** People with a proven criminal history or with a known affiliation with violent or dangerous groups (e.g., organized criminal groups, terrorist or cyber-terrorist organizations, illegal militias, mercenary organizations, violent hate groups, etc.), won’t be onboarded and will be terminated upon discovery such activities, without regards to the declared purpose of the corresponding profile.  
  
**Inactivity.** We reserve the right to suspend - with possible following termination, with or without prior notice - any content creator’s account/profile, that was inactive without prior notice - to us or to its Subscribers - for more than 30 days. All recurring billing will be paused. All collected pledges that are subject to payout will be processed within 30 calendar days upon payout request. In case when conditions for the payout are not met - all pledges will not be reimbursed whatsoever and will remain in the Service.  
  
**Deviations.** We reserve the right to suspend - with or without prior warning - any content creator’s account/profile, that displays, hosts or advertises content that is drastically deviated from the type of content approved during the onboarding process.  
  
**Call to Group Actions.** It’s strictly prohibited to ask anyone on the Platform - Subscribers or Stars - to request a refund, unsubscribe, leave Platform or initiate legal action against the Platform or participate in such actions.  
  
**Profile / Account Ghosting.** It’s strictly prohibited to create an account/profile with the same, new, or altered credentials after an initial account/profile by this particular Star/User was terminated, suspended, or otherwise disabled. For instance, if the profile "X" was terminated, it is prohibited to create a new profile "Y" by the same individual, organization, and/or any other associated entity.   
  
**Permanent Absence.** Upon receiving a piece of reliable information about a particular Star being deceased or otherwise permanently had lost the ability to operate this Service, we reserve the following rights:

1. No payout request will be accepted made on behalf of the deceased Star.
2. No payments will be processed toward the subscription or commissions to this profile.
3. The payments made prior to the billing termination are not eligible for refunds.

### Onboarding Stars

To start posting/publishing on this Platform, you have to become a Star.  
  
We provide our Service only to the Stars whose profiles/accounts are approved.  
  
Before a fully functional version of the Platform is available for your use as a Star, you will need to complete the Sign-Up form. This form must be completed in full, including your actual active e-mail address, secure password, original profile name, reasonable monthly subscription fee, attractive profile avatar, and meaningful profile description.  
  
Upon completion, your application will be reviewed and considered for approval, which may or may not be granted. We may grant approval or refuse to do so, at our sole discretion with or without explanation for each outcome.  
  
We reserve the right to take as much time as needed in order to finish the review process. If you believe your application was rejected by mistake, you can contact our Support Team via e-mail with questions and additional supporting materials or information.  
  
Those profiles that are under review should be expecting fair treatment, but profile owners must release us from any and all obligations with respect to the time that takes to review the profile and conditions that will be applied to the aforementioned review.  
  
After you signed up but before your profile fully approved, you can use Platform with limited features.

* * *

### Relationships between Stars, Subscribers and the Service

> Users who are active on our Platform or elsewhere and who are reluctant to reply to Platform's Support Team inquiries, are subject to the following actions: 
> 
> 1. We reserve the rights to pause billing for such a user (i.e., Star), resulting in the suspension of incoming pledges. 
> 2. If we unsuccessfully attempt to contact a Subscriber who demonstrates proven activity, access to all subscribed content may be restricted for this SubscribeStar user until the issue is resolved.

  
**PAYMENTS' DISPUTES  
**Service provides recourse to cardholders in the event of a dispute concerning payments. Service assumes all liability concerning the payment processing, including maintaining compliance with tax laws and taking steps to prevent fraud. All inquiries concerning payments should be submitted to **[\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**.**  
  
OTHER DISPUTES  
**We do not mediate or arbitrate relationships between Subscribers and Stars, nor do we interfere in any controversy that may derive from such relationships.In case that requires both parties' involvement (i.e., Subscribers and Stars) either should initiate contact with the opponent/proponent by any possible means, avoiding any involvement from our side. If such involvement is unavoidable, we reserve the right to proceed on whatever timeline and with whatever proposition we decide.  
  
In case when you, as a Subscriber or a Star having issues or concerns in regard to provided Services, we encourage you to contact us directly prior to initiating any related discussion online elsewhere.  
  
By agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative proceeding. We, as a Company and as a Service, are also waiving these rights.  
  
For further information, refer to the “Limitation of Liability” and “Indemnity” chapters.

* * *

### Copyright

We do not review, audit, revise, or curate content published on SubscribeStar.com to determine if it is a fair use case (ref. to "Limitations on exclusive rights"), but we will normally remove the reported content if we receive a valid DMCA takedown notice.  
  
If you believe that a content creator on our Service is infringing on your copyright, please send a DMCA takedown notice to [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to have the content removed. This notice must comply with the requirements of section 512(c)(3)(A) of the DMCA. Such notice will be immediately passed on to the content creator responsible for the creating/publishing of the artwork in question.  
  
We are giving the involved content creator 72 hours to handle a DMCA notice on their own before the Service will get directly involved.  
  
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service or any contact on the website through which the Service is provided, without the express written permission by us, unless we stated otherwise.

* * *

### Submissions

If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions (e.g. contest entries, proof of creative body of work, etc.) or without a request from us you send creative ideas, suggestions, proposals, plans, or other materials, whether online, by e-mail, by postal mail, or otherwise (collectively, “comments”), you agree that we may, at any time, without restriction, edit, copy, publish, distribute, translate and otherwise use in any medium any comments that you forward to us. We are and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain any comments in confidence; (2) to pay compensation for any comments; or (3) to respond to any comments.  
  
You are solely responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you or any third-party.

* * *

### Recurring Billing

The subscription mechanism of this Service is based on recurring billing.  
  
The recurring billing is enabled automatically after a Star gets five active Subscribers.  
  
Until then, the existing Subscribers have to manually initiate charge by going to [My Subscriptions](https://www.subscribestar.com/subscriptions) page and hitting the Pay action link found against the name of the Star in question in the Active Subscriptions section.  
  
The exact recurring charge date is not connected to the month's start nor to the end of it, but rather to the moment when subscription event has occurred. The recurring billing date is determined by the Service at our sole discretion. Normally, recurring billing for each subscription runs roughly every 30 calendar days for each subscription instance.  
  
We reserve the right to suspend a recurring billing for the following cases:

* When profile (i.e., Star) is not active for whatever reason for more than 14 days.
* If any activity associated with the account and/or profile are considered suspicious. To determine transactions or activities suspicious, we may take into consideration any data provided to us by third parties or base our decision upon our own internal investigation.

* * *

### Commissions

The Commissions is the form of a one-off pledge, that is dissociated from any subscription tier or subscription fee and can be set as a one-time payment with an arbitrary amount of money, up to $100 at once. Commissions are made for work that is already done or will be done in the future.  
  
Commissions can be made by anybody to the Star who has Commissions feature manually enabled by the Service staff.  
  
We are not obliged to enable the Commissions feature while reserving the right to disable it at any moment.  
  
We take up to 30 calendar days to review Commissions before processing and landing funds to Star’s account.

* * *

### Subscriptions

The subscription fee (i.e., price of monthly subscription) will be charged according to the billing model chosen by the Star and introduced to the Subscriber upon subscription.  
  
The number of payments paid by the Subscriber and the total amount depends on the first date of each billing cycle and settings, whether it should be paid instantly upon subscription or otherwise.  
  
A monthly billing cycle can be defined as 28, 30, or 31 days regardless of the number of days in the following or current calendar month.  
  
When a Subscriber changes the subscription tier, a new subscription is initiated, canceling the initial one. In other words, Subscribers pay as if they subscribe for the first time following the current billing model chosen by the Star.  
  
Every subscription has its own date and time, therefore multiple subscriptions will result in multiple charges, rather than in one batch charge.  
  
Prices for subscriptions are subject to change by Stars without notice. Any further disputes in regard to subscription price changes must be handled by the Subscribers with the Stars (i.e., content providers) directly via available e-mail or direct messaging. Please, refer to our [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
By becoming a Subscriber, you confirm that you use your own payment method that issued in your name and belongs to you. Subsequently, you agree to comply with our payment processors’ rules and regulations in their entirety.  
  
None of the monthly subscriptions can run unverified and without a manual renewal by the Subscribers longer than 365 or 366 days for a leap-year, whichever is applicable.   
  
Every subscription must be reviewed and manually renewed by the associated Subscriber at least once per year. This must be done on or before December 31st, or whenever requested by the Platform.  
   
The renewal is done via mechanism and on a schedule provided by the Platform. Both mechanism and a schedule are unequivocally presented to each active Subscriber within the Platform and are applied to every subscription individually.  
   
The subscriptions will be put on hold until further developments if failed to be renewed in a timely manner. Upon subscription hold being initiated, all associated inbound and outbound funds flow will be stopped.  
  
If and when our attempt to charge the current payment method fails, we will repeat such an attempt within the next few hours. When such attempts are unsuccessful, the selected payment method is deemed faulty and will be marked as such in the Payment Options section of the Account Settings page. To continue with the existing and future subscriptions, you will have to adjust a payment method by adding a previously used but updated credit/debit card. Alternatively, you can add a new card. As soon as this change happens, we will automatically repeat our attempts to charge your updated preferred payment method unless the recurring billing was disabled.  
  
We may, at our sole discretion, limit or cancel subscriptions.

* * *

### Unsubscriptions

The Subscriber can cancel subscription (i.e., unsubscribe) at any time.  
  
Upon unsubscribing from the Star, the Subscriber will lose access to the subscribed materials.  
  
If you believe you deserve a refund for a canceled subscription (i.e., unsubscription), please, refer to our  [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
Upon subscribing again to the same profile - no matter how short the period of time was between unsubscription and re-subscription - the Subscriber will be charged full price for the new subscription according to the subscription price set on the profile.

* * *

### Cancellation Policy

1. Subscribers can cancel their subscriptions at any time, either immediately or by scheduling the cancellation for the end of the paid period.
2. If these Terms of Service are violated by the Subscriber, the connected subscription(s) may be put on hold or terminated along with the related Subscriber's account.
3. While Stars can’t delete profiles with paid subscriptions, they may want to schedule such deletions instead. The profile will be deleted on the last day of the paid period, and all related subscriptions will be subsequently canceled.
4. When a refund is issued for a subscription, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. In certain cases, such cancellation might be final and irreversible.
5. When a chargeback is initiated by the Subscriber, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. Such cancellation is final and irreversible.
6. If a Subscriber requests cancellation of the subscription while reaching out via their registered and verified email account, and provides enough information, such subscription might be canceled. Email requests are the only reliable communication accepted for such cases.
7. Subscriptions will be put on pause and potentially canceled if the Subscriber hasn’t paid for the subscription or if the system has failed to charge the related account.
8. If a Subscriber isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Subscriber wasn’t using the subscription, we might cancel such a subscription.
9. If a profile the Subscriber has access to isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Star wasn’t using the Platform, we might cancel such subscription(s).

### Fees for Subscribers

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Subscriber with our Service.   
  
You can cancel your pledge (i.e., subscription) at any time.   
  
As a Subscriber, you will be charged Subscription Fee instantly upon subscription or according to the charging model selected by the Star. Thereafter, this fee will be debited from your preferred payment option on a monthly basis (roughly - every 30 days). Depending on your location, some banks may charge you a Foreign Transaction Fee for your pledge, which will be assessed in addition to the pledge amount.   
  
The Foreign Transaction Fee is subject to change by the authorized institutions without prior notice. We have no control over this charge.   
  
If the Subscriber ordinarily resides in the country or territory that requires collecting VAT, then VAT will be added to the final amount.  
  
The specific VAT amount depends on the country, county, and city of supporters' residences. Supporters will see the exact VAT amount when setting up their initial pledge (i.e., Subscription or Commission).   
  
We reserve the right to modify existing VAT rates or apply VAT to Subscribers' contributions in compliance with relevant tax regulations.   
  
We also reserve the right to deduct the VAT amount from incoming transactions when required.  
  
The Platform collects the necessary taxes and then distributes them in line with the applicable rules and regulations.

* * *

### Fees for Stars

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Star with our Service.  
  
As a Star, you will need to set a Subscription Fee during the registering process. You can change this fee at any time unless you have existing active subscribers. The upper limit for the Subscription Fee is $100.  
  
Payment Processing Fees of 2.9% + $0.3 (3.5% + $0.3 for amounts greater than $30) will be applied to each transaction (i.e., Subscription, Commission) made toward Star's account. This amount will be deducted from the Star's monthly earnings during the Payout.  
  
Additional fees may be associated with the Payout (see “Payouts”).

* * *

### Subscription Tiers

To gradually reward your Subscribers, you can set a few Subscription Tiers, each with a different Subscription Fee.  
  
As a Subscriber, you can switch to a higher (i.e., upgrade) or lower (i.e., downgrade) Subscription Tier at any time, if multiple Subscription Tiers are set by the Star.  
  
While upgrading, the price difference between the Tiers will be debited from the preferred payment method; when downgrading, there won't be any credits issued for the price difference.

> Downgrading will result in instant revocation of access to all content previously available from the higher Tier.

  
Charges and billing date changes, or the absence of such, will be indicated during the upgrade or downgrade, so the Subscriber can make a conscious choice before proceeding with a switch.

* * *

### Payouts

**General Statements**

Payout is a process of sending funds collected on the Star's account to a chosen by this User financial instrument or institution (e.g., bank, eWallet).   
  
The payout can be issued exclusively to a person or organization that is the User who initially registered the account with the Service and who conducts the actual content publishing activities within the Platform.  
  
While in some exceptional cases, the payout can be issued to the payee different than the original User, there is no guarantee we will do that.  
  
We cannot transfer the funds accumulated in one Star's account to another Star's account. If such a transfer was previously requested and executed, and if the sending Star is eligible for a 1099-K, the form will only reflect payments processed for that specific Star. In other words, any transfers from that Star to other content creators will not be included in the 1099-K.  
  
If we deem the information in our possession is insufficient for payout purposes, we may request additional identification or proof of substance from the payee. Such documents may include Driver's License, State ID, National or International Passport, Citizenship, or National ID Card for individuals. And for the organization, the Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of Organization, or any other similar company formation documents may be requested.  
  
These documents are requested by our processing partners, who are subject to regulations by the higher financial authorities of the corresponding countries (e.g., the card brands, banks, NACHA, The Financial Conduct Authority, and similar institutions). The requesting entity checks all received information against Money Laundering Act and other applicable policies.   
  
For the cases when the payout wasn't delivered, we may request proof of such a non-delivery in the form of a bank statement for the related period.  
  
Providing this information may prevent our Users from being flagged as sanctioned individuals or organizations that belong to OFAC list, ones linked to fraud or other unlawful affairs.  
  
A User must meet the following criteria to be eligible for payouts: 

* Active profile (consistently deliver content or service to subscribers).
* Acceptable level of requested refunds (your subscribers shouldn’t have a trend of requesting refunds).
* Acceptable level of chargebacks (not going over 1% of total transactions with initiated chargebacks).
* Submitted and verified Taxpayer Forms (W-9, W-8BEN, or W-8BEN-E, whichever applicable).
* Verified identity if requested (verification depends on a country of residence).
* The payout information is filled out in full and verified.
* A selected Payout Vendor can serve the User in their country of residence.
* The User doesn’t violate the Payout Vendor’s terms of their service.
* A selected Payout Vendor can provide the service of sending funds from the Service’s account.

  
**Additional conditions**

1. The related profile has at least 5 actively paying subscribers (can be subject to change per User request)
2. The profile has at least USD150 in pledges collected (we may apply exceptions for different regions; for example, the limit for creators from the United States can be set to USD30)
3. At least 14 days have passed since the Star's account was initially approved
4. At least 14 days have passed since we successfully processed the previously submitted payout request (we make exceptions per User request and often automatically lower this limit to 7 days)

Star must submit a request on the Payouts page to initiate the payout process.  
  
The exceptions from these conditions can be made upon request sent to [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  
  
We reserve the right to deny or pause payout to any User until the matters in question are resolved, if:

* The User failed to provide us with all required and requested information.
* If the information provided is false, omitted, incomplete, or suspicious in any other way (each as determined by the Service in its sole discretion).
* Whenever requested by the Service, the User failed to prove that all related activity on the Service is lawful, as governed by state or province of residence or by international law. 

  
**Timeframe**

Processing payout and delivering funds to the Star’s bank account will take the time that depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star’s account.

For the very first payout request, or when a payout method was changed or updated, there will be a 5 (five) business days delay from the date these changes took place. We use this time to verify the information associated with the changes/updates.  
  
Payouts of less than USD20,000.00 will be initiated within the next 14 business days (on average it takes about 5 business days), following the day the request was submitted. Business days are counted based on the United States holidays/weekends official calendar as well as payment vendor’s and Star’s side. It may take up to 14 business days for the payout to reach your bank account. Typically for ACH transfers it takes 1-3 business days, and for Wire - 1-10 business days.

We may decide to break down to a few separate payments any payout requests that are equal to or more than USD20,000.00. We take no less than 14 business days to process such batch payment.

> Whenever we detect an increased number of refunds toward a particular Star's profile or identify a risk of such an event happening in the foreseen future, we reserve rights to extend the payout processing period beyond 14 business days.

  
The amount equal to 10% of all funds collected by any particular Star can be held for 30 days without being able to be requested for disbursement if and when:

1. The refund rate related to this Star deemed to be “significant” by the Service
2. The content, advertised and promised to be delivered by this Star has failed to be delivered in a timely manner

To prevent any damages that may occur upon possible chargebacks, the Service may keep 10% of all effectively collected funds, but no less than USD35, for 30 business days before making them available to be included in the payout request.  
  
We reserve the right to take additional unlimited time to process the payout if:

* The User has submitted incorrect, suspicious, or incomplete Taxpayer Identification forms.
* The User has submitted invalid or incomplete payout details.
* Any third-party institution (e.g., bank) or organization (e.g., money transfer service) involved in the payout process fails or delays in making the payment into the User account.
* The User who submitted the payout request isn't the actual owner of the receiving account. 

  
**Limits**

The minimum amount of the payout request is USD150, and the actual limit depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star account. Please contact support to know more about your specific case.

The highest amount requested for the payout cannot be greater than the balance available for the payout. The balance available for the payout is based on the proprietary algorithms of the Service and may change without notice.

  
**Fees**

The User pays all and any fees and taxes associated with receiving money on their account.

The Service takes the rights to deduct from the payouts:

* Service Fee - 5% of all successfully processed pledges, (i.e., subscriptions, commissions) to the date of payout request.
* Payment Processing Fee (typically is 2.9% + USD0.3 per transaction, 3.5% + USD0.3 for transactions over USD30).
* Payout Fees associated with the payout. The exact amount of this fee depends on the payout option selected by the User, current currency exchange rate, fees set by the related payment vendor.
* The total amount of refunded, disputed, incomplete, failed, fraudulent, suspicious payments/transactions or any expenses caused by such events and circumstances.
* Any payments/transactions made by mistake.
* Any pledges that were not deposited on the Service’s bank account for any reason.

>  If your account experiences an excessive payment decline rate, we reserve the right to recover compensation for any associated extra expenses. Typically, if the decline rate exceeds 12%, the associated transaction fees paid by SubscribeStar will be passed on to the platform integrator (profile owner).  
>   
> If the disputes rate associated with your profile exceeds 0.25%, we reserve the right to suspend the billing processing and hold the remaining balance up to 4 months. 

  
If the payout to the content creator fails due to the reasons other than actions or inactions of the Service, we keep the rights to apply the following rules:

1. A subsequent payout request will be possible not earlier than the Service receives funds returned by the Star's bank to its account in full. This time period is usually less than 2 (two) months but is almost never shorter than 2 (two) weeks due to the differences in processing practices of each financial institution involved in such transaction.
2. All fees associated with such transaction will be deducted from the account of corresponding Star.

Per each transaction, Service takes rights to round:

* Referral Associate commission amount.
* Payout amount.
* Service Fee amount.

Round-off error may vary within USD1.00.  
  

**Inactive Stars**

Those content creators who, in the current year:

a) eligible for a payout (i.e., whose payable balance has reached a threshold of USD150);  
  
AND  
  
b) have not requested a payout within 6 (six) consecutive months for any reason, including wrong or missing information on tax forms, missing mailing address, etc., potentially, are subjects to the following:

1. Billing will be paused, which will effectively prevent these Stars from getting new Subscribers.
2. Some fee will be applied monthly, with funds taken from the remaining balance of the corresponding accounts. This fee originates from the fact that we, as a Company, responsible for paying the relevant out-of-pocket costs related to keeping remaining balances in our business bank account.

  
The aforementioned actions aren't applicable if a Star:

1. Informed us about such inactivity beforehand.
2. Joined the Platform between December 1 and December 31 of the current year.

> Funds collected in a Star's account, if not regularly withdrawn, may be subject to automated remittance. This process will distribute portions of the remaining balance to the last known valid payout account of this Star. 

* * *

### Hiatus

Any Star can take a break in activities on the Platform - to go on vacation, take some time off, or leave for hiatus.   
  
We strongly advise any content creator to inform Service about such a break a few days ahead. 

> It is imperative to announce the upcoming vacation a few days prior to leaving via message in a post pinned to Star's profile on SubscribeStar.

  
When Star leaves for hiatus, and it takes significantly more time than this Star has informed us about before leaving, the following happens:

1. All payouts - if any were in progress or initiated during this hiatus - could be put on hold, to be resumed in 30 calendar days automatically.
2. Recurring billing will be paused until Star returns from the break and informs us about it via [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Star can request a payout while being on longer-than-expected leave. 

* * *

### Modifications to the Service and Prices

### Dissolution of the Company

1. **Notification of Dissolution**

    \- Stars will have 90 days from the date of the dissolution notice to request a payout of their remaining balance.  
    \- Payout requests must be submitted through the usual payout request procedure (i.e., via the “Payouts” page).
3. **Forfeiture of Unclaimed Balances**  
    \- If a Star does not request a payout within the 90-day period, their remaining balance will be permanently forfeited.  
    \- After the 90-day period, SubscribeStar will retain all unclaimed balances, and these funds will no longer be available for payout.
4. **Provision of Remittance Details**  
    If the Platform doesn’t have available options for paying out the remaining balance to a specific content creator, the content creator must provide their details for remittance via options described in the Notification of Dissolution within 30 days after the public announcement of the dissolution. Failure to do so may result in the inability to remit the remaining balance.
5. **Finality and Waiver of Claims**  
    \- Stars acknowledge and agree that after the 90-day payout request period, they will have no further claim to any balances that were not requested within the designated period.  
    \- By continuing to use the Platform, Stars agree to waive any future claims or legal actions against SubscribeStar regarding unclaimed balances post-dissolution.

  
By using SubscribeStar, Stars agree to these terms in the event of the Company's dissolution and understand the importance of timely action to request payouts within the specified period.

### Profile and Account Termination

You can delete your profile and account at any time unless you have active subscribers as a Star.  
  
We can terminate or suspend your account/profile at any time at our discretion. We can also cancel any pledges and remove any content at our sole discretion with or without prior warning and/or explanation. However, in absolute majority cases, we will contact you prior to the account/profile suspension/termination.  
  
Upon account/profile termination, the following will happen:  
  
**For Subscribers:** all subscriptions will be canceled immediately and no refunds for ongoing subscriptions will be issued whatsoever. Subscribers will retain access to the subscribed material until the end of the subscription period. In order to keep the ability to access subscriptions, Subscribers will need to keep their accounts intact.  
  
**For Stars:** all payouts, if any in progress or available for the request, will be put on hold for 30 calendar days. We use this time to settle all possible requests from the Subscribers for the paybacks and other disputes. In case when conditions for the payout are not met (i.e. less than 5 paid subscribers and less than $50 collected pledges) - all pledges will not be reimbursed to the Star whatsoever and will remain in the Service.  
  
**For both roles:** all financial transactions data and previously filled out tax forms will stay in possession of the respective third parties and/or the Service, for the duration of time outlined by the aforementioned third parties’ “Terms of Service” or similar legal documents.

  

**The reasons for account suspension or termination including, but not limited to, as follows:  
**  

> If a Subscriber's actions or inactions result in a chargeback initiated against the Platform, we may decide to end our relationship with that Subscriber, with or without prior notice. We kindly ask all Subscribers to contact us before calling your bank regarding any concerns related to the subscription payments.

**Impersonation.** Presenting yourself as somebody else, especially well known and famous, leads to instant and permanent termination of the account, upon discovery.  
  
**Creating or Distributing Deepfakes.** Generating or disseminating content that alters the identity of individuals in a manner that could mislead users about the authenticity of the content. This includes manipulating voices, images, or videos of celebrities and political figures.  
  
**Identity Manipulation.** Using Artificial Intelligence (aka, “AI”) to modify the appearance, voice, or actions of individuals without explicit consent, thereby potentially infringing on personal rights and privacy.  
  
**Misleading Content.** Publishing any synthetic media that could confuse users regarding the truthfulness of events, statements, or identities. This is particularly critical for content involving public figures and celebrities, where authenticity matters.

**Inactivity.** We reserve the right to suspend - with possible following termination, with or without prior notice - any content creator’s account/profile, that was inactive without prior notice - to us or to its Subscribers - for more than 30 days. All recurring billing will be paused. All collected pledges that are subject to payout will be processed within 30 calendar days upon payout request. In case when conditions for the payout are not met - all pledges will not be reimbursed whatsoever and will remain in the Service.

**Call to Group Actions.** It’s strictly prohibited to ask anyone on the Platform - Subscribers or Stars - to request a refund, unsubscribe, leave Platform or initiate legal action against the Platform or participate in such actions.  
  
**Profile / Account Ghosting.** It’s strictly prohibited to create an account/profile with the same, new, or altered credentials after an initial account/profile by this particular Star/User was terminated, suspended, or otherwise disabled.

### Copyright

We do not review, audit, revise, or curate content published on SubscribeStar.com to determine if it is a fair use case (ref. to "Limitations on exclusive rights"), but we will normally remove the reported content if we receive a valid DMCA takedown notice.

You are solely responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you or any third-party.

* * *

### Recurring Billing

The subscription mechanism of this Service is based on recurring billing.  
  
The recurring billing is enabled automatically after a Star gets five active Subscribers.  
  
Until then, the existing Subscribers have to manually initiate charge by going to [My Subscriptions](https://www.subscribestar.com/subscriptions) page and hitting the Pay action link found against the name of the Star in question in the Active Subscriptions section.  
  
The exact recurring charge date is not connected to the month's start nor to the end of it, but rather to the moment when subscription event has occurred. The recurring billing date is determined by the Service at our sole discretion. Normally, recurring billing for each subscription runs roughly every 30 calendar days for each subscription instance.  
  
We reserve the right to suspend a recurring billing for the following cases:

* When profile (i.e., Star) is not active for whatever reason for more than 14 days.
* If any activity associated with the account and/or profile are considered suspicious. To determine transactions or activities suspicious, we may take into consideration any data provided to us by third parties or base our decision upon our own internal investigation.

* * *

### Commissions

The Commissions is the form of a one-off pledge, that is dissociated from any subscription tier or subscription fee and can be set as a one-time payment with an arbitrary amount of money, up to $100 at once. Commissions are made for work that is already done or will be done in the future.  
  
Commissions can be made by anybody to the Star who has Commissions feature manually enabled by the Service staff.  
  
We are not obliged to enable the Commissions feature while reserving the right to disable it at any moment.  
  
We take up to 30 calendar days to review Commissions before processing and landing funds to Star’s account.

* * *

### Subscriptions

The subscription fee (i.e., price of monthly subscription) will be charged according to the billing model chosen by the Star and introduced to the Subscriber upon subscription.  
  
The number of payments paid by the Subscriber and the total amount depends on the first date of each billing cycle and settings, whether it should be paid instantly upon subscription or otherwise.  
  
A monthly billing cycle can be defined as 28, 30, or 31 days regardless of the number of days in the following or current calendar month.  
  
When a Subscriber changes the subscription tier, a new subscription is initiated, canceling the initial one. In other words, Subscribers pay as if they subscribe for the first time following the current billing model chosen by the Star.  
  
Every subscription has its own date and time, therefore multiple subscriptions will result in multiple charges, rather than in one batch charge.  
  
Prices for subscriptions are subject to change by Stars without notice. Any further disputes in regard to subscription price changes must be handled by the Subscribers with the Stars (i.e., content providers) directly via available e-mail or direct messaging. Please, refer to our [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
By becoming a Subscriber, you confirm that you use your own payment method that issued in your name and belongs to you. Subsequently, you agree to comply with our payment processors’ rules and regulations in their entirety.  
  
None of the monthly subscriptions can run unverified and without a manual renewal by the Subscribers longer than 365 or 366 days for a leap-year, whichever is applicable.   
  
Every subscription must be reviewed and manually renewed by the associated Subscriber at least once per year. This must be done on or before December 31st, or whenever requested by the Platform.  
   
The renewal is done via mechanism and on a schedule provided by the Platform. Both mechanism and a schedule are unequivocally presented to each active Subscriber within the Platform and are applied to every subscription individually.  
   
The subscriptions will be put on hold until further developments if failed to be renewed in a timely manner. Upon subscription hold being initiated, all associated inbound and outbound funds flow will be stopped.  
  
If and when our attempt to charge the current payment method fails, we will repeat such an attempt within the next few hours. When such attempts are unsuccessful, the selected payment method is deemed faulty and will be marked as such in the Payment Options section of the Account Settings page. To continue with the existing and future subscriptions, you will have to adjust a payment method by adding a previously used but updated credit/debit card. Alternatively, you can add a new card. As soon as this change happens, we will automatically repeat our attempts to charge your updated preferred payment method unless the recurring billing was disabled.  
  
We may, at our sole discretion, limit or cancel subscriptions.

* * *

### Unsubscriptions

The Subscriber can cancel subscription (i.e., unsubscribe) at any time.  
  
Upon unsubscribing from the Star, the Subscriber will lose access to the subscribed materials.  
  
If you believe you deserve a refund for a canceled subscription (i.e., unsubscription), please, refer to our  [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
Upon subscribing again to the same profile - no matter how short the period of time was between unsubscription and re-subscription - the Subscriber will be charged full price for the new subscription according to the subscription price set on the profile.

* * *

### Cancellation Policy

1. Subscribers can cancel their subscriptions at any time, either immediately or by scheduling the cancellation for the end of the paid period.
2. If these Terms of Service are violated by the Subscriber, the connected subscription(s) may be put on hold or terminated along with the related Subscriber's account.
3. While Stars can’t delete profiles with paid subscriptions, they may want to schedule such deletions instead. The profile will be deleted on the last day of the paid period, and all related subscriptions will be subsequently canceled.
4. When a refund is issued for a subscription, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. In certain cases, such cancellation might be final and irreversible.
5. When a chargeback is initiated by the Subscriber, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. Such cancellation is final and irreversible.
6. If a Subscriber requests cancellation of the subscription while reaching out via their registered and verified email account, and provides enough information, such subscription might be canceled. Email requests are the only reliable communication accepted for such cases.
7. Subscriptions will be put on pause and potentially canceled if the Subscriber hasn’t paid for the subscription or if the system has failed to charge the related account.
8. If a Subscriber isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Subscriber wasn’t using the subscription, we might cancel such a subscription.
9. If a profile the Subscriber has access to isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Star wasn’t using the Platform, we might cancel such subscription(s).

### Fees for Subscribers

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Subscriber with our Service.   
  
You can cancel your pledge (i.e., subscription) at any time.   
  
As a Subscriber, you will be charged Subscription Fee instantly upon subscription or according to the charging model selected by the Star. Thereafter, this fee will be debited from your preferred payment option on a monthly basis (roughly - every 30 days). Depending on your location, some banks may charge you a Foreign Transaction Fee for your pledge, which will be assessed in addition to the pledge amount.   
  
The Foreign Transaction Fee is subject to change by the authorized institutions without prior notice. We have no control over this charge.   
  
If the Subscriber ordinarily resides in the country or territory that requires collecting VAT, then VAT will be added to the final amount.  
  
The specific VAT amount depends on the country, county, and city of supporters' residences. Supporters will see the exact VAT amount when setting up their initial pledge (i.e., Subscription or Commission).   
  
We reserve the right to modify existing VAT rates or apply VAT to Subscribers' contributions in compliance with relevant tax regulations.   
  
We also reserve the right to deduct the VAT amount from incoming transactions when required.  
  
The Platform collects the necessary taxes and then distributes them in line with the applicable rules and regulations.

* * *

### Fees for Stars

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Star with our Service.  
  
As a Star, you will need to set a Subscription Fee during the registering process. You can change this fee at any time unless you have existing active subscribers. The upper limit for the Subscription Fee is $100.  
  
Payment Processing Fees of 2.9% + $0.3 (3.5% + $0.3 for amounts greater than $30) will be applied to each transaction (i.e., Subscription, Commission) made toward Star's account. This amount will be deducted from the Star's monthly earnings during the Payout.  
  
Additional fees may be associated with the Payout (see “Payouts”).

* * *

### Subscription Tiers

To gradually reward your Subscribers, you can set a few Subscription Tiers, each with a different Subscription Fee.  
  
As a Subscriber, you can switch to a higher (i.e., upgrade) or lower (i.e., downgrade) Subscription Tier at any time, if multiple Subscription Tiers are set by the Star.  
  
While upgrading, the price difference between the Tiers will be debited from the preferred payment method; when downgrading, there won't be any credits issued for the price difference.

> Downgrading will result in instant revocation of access to all content previously available from the higher Tier.

  
Charges and billing date changes, or the absence of such, will be indicated during the upgrade or downgrade, so the Subscriber can make a conscious choice before proceeding with a switch.

* * *

### Payouts

**General Statements**

Payout is a process of sending funds collected on the Star's account to a chosen by this User financial instrument or institution (e.g., bank, eWallet).   
  
The payout can be issued exclusively to a person or organization that is the User who initially registered the account with the Service and who conducts the actual content publishing activities within the Platform.  
  
While in some exceptional cases, the payout can be issued to the payee different than the original User, there is no guarantee we will do that.  
  
We cannot transfer the funds accumulated in one Star's account to another Star's account. If such a transfer was previously requested and executed, and if the sending Star is eligible for a 1099-K, the form will only reflect payments processed for that specific Star. In other words, any transfers from that Star to other content creators will not be included in the 1099-K.  
  
If we deem the information in our possession is insufficient for payout purposes, we may request additional identification or proof of substance from the payee. Such documents may include Driver's License, State ID, National or International Passport, Citizenship, or National ID Card for individuals. And for the organization, the Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of Organization, or any other similar company formation documents may be requested.  
  
These documents are requested by our processing partners, who are subject to regulations by the higher financial authorities of the corresponding countries (e.g., the card brands, banks, NACHA, The Financial Conduct Authority, and similar institutions). The requesting entity checks all received information against Money Laundering Act and other applicable policies.   
  
For the cases when the payout wasn't delivered, we may request proof of such a non-delivery in the form of a bank statement for the related period.  
  
Providing this information may prevent our Users from being flagged as sanctioned individuals or organizations that belong to OFAC list, ones linked to fraud or other unlawful affairs.  
  
A User must meet the following criteria to be eligible for payouts: 

* Active profile (consistently deliver content or service to subscribers).
* Acceptable level of requested refunds (your subscribers shouldn’t have a trend of requesting refunds).
* Acceptable level of chargebacks (not going over 1% of total transactions with initiated chargebacks).
* Submitted and verified Taxpayer Forms (W-9, W-8BEN, or W-8BEN-E, whichever applicable).
* Verified identity if requested (verification depends on a country of residence).
* The payout information is filled out in full and verified.
* A selected Payout Vendor can serve the User in their country of residence.
* The User doesn’t violate the Payout Vendor’s terms of their service.
* A selected Payout Vendor can provide the service of sending funds from the Service’s account.

  
**Additional conditions**

1. The related profile has at least 5 actively paying subscribers (can be subject to change per User request)
2. The profile has at least USD150 in pledges collected (we may apply exceptions for different regions; for example, the limit for creators from the United States can be set to USD30)
3. At least 14 days have passed since the Star's account was initially approved
4. At least 14 days have passed since we successfully processed the previously submitted payout request (we make exceptions per User request and often automatically lower this limit to 7 days)

Star must submit a request on the Payouts page to initiate the payout process.  
  
The exceptions from these conditions can be made upon request sent to [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  
  
We reserve the right to deny or pause payout to any User until the matters in question are resolved, if:

* The User failed to provide us with all required and requested information.
* If the information provided is false, omitted, incomplete, or suspicious in any other way (each as determined by the Service in its sole discretion).
* Whenever requested by the Service, the User failed to prove that all related activity on the Service is lawful, as governed by state or province of residence or by international law. 

  
**Timeframe**

Processing payout and delivering funds to the Star’s bank account will take the time that depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star’s account.

For the very first payout request, or when a payout method was changed or updated, there will be a 5 (five) business days delay from the date these changes took place. We use this time to verify the information associated with the changes/updates.  
  
Payouts of less than USD20,000.00 will be initiated within the next 14 business days (on average it takes about 5 business days), following the day the request was submitted. Business days are counted based on the United States holidays/weekends official calendar as well as payment vendor’s and Star’s side. It may take up to 14 business days for the payout to reach your bank account. Typically for ACH transfers it takes 1-3 business days, and for Wire - 1-10 business days.

We may decide to break down to a few separate payments any payout requests that are equal to or more than USD20,000.00. We take no less than 14 business days to process such batch payment.

> Whenever we detect an increased number of refunds toward a particular Star's profile or identify a risk of such an event happening in the foreseen future, we reserve rights to extend the payout processing period beyond 14 business days.

  
The amount equal to 10% of all funds collected by any particular Star can be held for 30 days without being able to be requested for disbursement if and when:

1. The refund rate related to this Star deemed to be “significant” by the Service
2. The content, advertised and promised to be delivered by this Star has failed to be delivered in a timely manner

To prevent any damages that may occur upon possible chargebacks, the Service may keep 10% of all effectively collected funds, but no less than USD35, for 30 business days before making them available to be included in the payout request.  
  
We reserve the right to take additional unlimited time to process the payout if:

* The User has submitted incorrect, suspicious, or incomplete Taxpayer Identification forms.
* The User has submitted invalid or incomplete payout details.
* Any third-party institution (e.g., bank) or organization (e.g., money transfer service) involved in the payout process fails or delays in making the payment into the User account.
* The User who submitted the payout request isn't the actual owner of the receiving account. 

  
**Limits**

The minimum amount of the payout request is USD150, and the actual limit depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star account. Please contact support to know more about your specific case.

The highest amount requested for the payout cannot be greater than the balance available for the payout. The balance available for the payout is based on the proprietary algorithms of the Service and may change without notice.

  
**Fees**

The User pays all and any fees and taxes associated with receiving money on their account.

The Service takes the rights to deduct from the payouts:

* Service Fee - 5% of all successfully processed pledges, (i.e., subscriptions, commissions) to the date of payout request.
* Payment Processing Fee (typically is 2.9% + USD0.3 per transaction, 3.5% + USD0.3 for transactions over USD30).
* Payout Fees associated with the payout. The exact amount of this fee depends on the payout option selected by the User, current currency exchange rate, fees set by the related payment vendor.
* The total amount of refunded, disputed, incomplete, failed, fraudulent, suspicious payments/transactions or any expenses caused by such events and circumstances.
* Any payments/transactions made by mistake.
* Any pledges that were not deposited on the Service’s bank account for any reason.

>  If your account experiences an excessive payment decline rate, we reserve the right to recover compensation for any associated extra expenses. Typically, if the decline rate exceeds 12%, the associated transaction fees paid by SubscribeStar will be passed on to the platform integrator (profile owner).  
>   
> If the disputes rate associated with your profile exceeds 0.25%, we reserve the right to suspend the billing processing and hold the remaining balance up to 4 months. 

  
If the payout to the content creator fails due to the reasons other than actions or inactions of the Service, we keep the rights to apply the following rules:

1. A subsequent payout request will be possible not earlier than the Service receives funds returned by the Star's bank to its account in full. This time period is usually less than 2 (two) months but is almost never shorter than 2 (two) weeks due to the differences in processing practices of each financial institution involved in such transaction.
2. All fees associated with such transaction will be deducted from the account of corresponding Star.

Per each transaction, Service takes rights to round:

* Referral Associate commission amount.
* Payout amount.
* Service Fee amount.

Round-off error may vary within USD1.00.  
  

**Inactive Stars**

Those content creators who, in the current year:

a) eligible for a payout (i.e., whose payable balance has reached a threshold of USD150);  
  
AND  
  
b) have not requested a payout within 6 (six) consecutive months for any reason, including wrong or missing information on tax forms, missing mailing address, etc., potentially, are subjects to the following:

1. Billing will be paused, which will effectively prevent these Stars from getting new Subscribers.
2. Some fee will be applied monthly, with funds taken from the remaining balance of the corresponding accounts. This fee originates from the fact that we, as a Company, responsible for paying the relevant out-of-pocket costs related to keeping remaining balances in our business bank account.

  
The aforementioned actions aren't applicable if a Star:

1. Informed us about such inactivity beforehand.
2. Joined the Platform between December 1 and December 31 of the current year.

> Funds collected in a Star's account, if not regularly withdrawn, may be subject to automated remittance. This process will distribute portions of the remaining balance to the last known valid payout account of this Star. 

* * *

### Hiatus

Any Star can take a break in activities on the Platform - to go on vacation, take some time off, or leave for hiatus.   
  
We strongly advise any content creator to inform Service about such a break a few days ahead. 

> It is imperative to announce the upcoming vacation a few days prior to leaving via message in a post pinned to Star's profile on SubscribeStar.

  
When Star leaves for hiatus, and it takes significantly more time than this Star has informed us about before leaving, the following happens:

1. All payouts - if any were in progress or initiated during this hiatus - could be put on hold, to be resumed in 30 calendar days automatically.
2. Recurring billing will be paused until Star returns from the break and informs us about it via [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Star can request a payout while being on longer-than-expected leave. 

* * *

    \- If a Star does not request a payout within the 90-day period, their remaining balance will be permanently forfeited.  
    \- After the 90-day period, SubscribeStar will retain all unclaimed balances, and these funds will no longer be available for payout.
4. **Provision of Remittance Details**  
    If the Platform doesn’t have available options for paying out the remaining balance to a specific content creator, the content creator must provide their details for remittance via options described in the Notification of Dissolution within 30 days after the public announcement of the dissolution. Failure to do so may result in the inability to remit the remaining balance.
5. **Finality and Waiver of Claims**  
    \- Stars acknowledge and agree that after the 90-day payout request period, they will have no further claim to any balances that were not requested within the designated period.  
    \- By continuing to use the Platform, Stars agree to waive any future claims or legal actions against SubscribeStar regarding unclaimed balances post-dissolution.

### Profile and Account Termination

You can delete your profile and account at any time unless you have active subscribers as a Star.  
  
We can terminate or suspend your account/profile at any time at our discretion. We can also cancel any pledges and remove any content at our sole discretion with or without prior warning and/or explanation. However, in absolute majority cases, we will contact you prior to the account/profile suspension/termination.  
  
Upon account/profile termination, the following will happen:  
  
**For Subscribers:** all subscriptions will be canceled immediately and no refunds for ongoing subscriptions will be issued whatsoever. Subscribers will retain access to the subscribed material until the end of the subscription period. In order to keep the ability to access subscriptions, Subscribers will need to keep their accounts intact.  
  
**For Stars:** all payouts, if any in progress or available for the request, will be put on hold for 30 calendar days. We use this time to settle all possible requests from the Subscribers for the paybacks and other disputes. In case when conditions for the payout are not met (i.e. less than 5 paid subscribers and less than $50 collected pledges) - all pledges will not be reimbursed to the Star whatsoever and will remain in the Service.  
  
**For both roles:** all financial transactions data and previously filled out tax forms will stay in possession of the respective third parties and/or the Service, for the duration of time outlined by the aforementioned third parties’ “Terms of Service” or similar legal documents.

  

**The reasons for account suspension or termination including, but not limited to, as follows:  
**  

> If a Subscriber's actions or inactions result in a chargeback initiated against the Platform, we may decide to end our relationship with that Subscriber, with or without prior notice. We kindly ask all Subscribers to contact us before calling your bank regarding any concerns related to the subscription payments.

**  
Illegal Activities.** This Service, as well as the company operating this Service, is governed by the laws of the United States of America. Anything that is considered “illegal” by the US law is illegal for use within our platform and will be removed/terminated.  
  
**Bullying.** Any form of abuse, persecution, harassment, attacking or bullying, either directly or by using your influence over others - within this platform or outside with the use of the platform or its parts - will lead to account suspension and investigation, which may result in subsequent profile/account termination.  
  
**Doxing.** It is absolutely forbidden to aggregate and publish on this Platform any private personal or sensitive information of anybody, regardless of the fact if this person is our User or not or reveal the identity of such an individual without the explicit written consent, for the purpose of intimidating aforementioned individual through harassment.  
  
**Private Information Abuse.** Any usage (e.g., sharing, storing, selling) any private information, that became available to the User via this Platform, including, but not limited to, e-mail or home addresses, personal name, and any other data that can be considered “sensitive” or “private”, is strictly prohibited.  
  
**Content Sharing.** Sharing somebody else’s content, that User got access to on this Platform, outside of this Platform without explicit permission from the original content owner is strictly prohibited.

**Miscellaneous Sharing.** Deliberate sharing of any encrypted, private, or other data related to the Service's operations, including but not limited to tokens, cookies, codes, passwords, as well as an unauthorized share of the correspondence between Service and its Users without explicit and direct permission from the Service, will lead to an immediate and permanent ban from the Platform.  
  
**Fraud.** Publishing, endorsing, or selling any fraudulent or misleading information or transmitting any digital substance or a code of a destructive nature on this Platform will lead to investigation and potential permanent termination of the account with the report to the appropriate authorities. While this Service has no intentions to follow, curate, investigate, check up on or make and extensive research on vast information published on the Platform, we will take actions in case the investigation - for one or another reason - is initiated.  
  
**Impersonation.** Presenting yourself as somebody else, especially well known and famous, leads to instant and permanent termination of the account, upon discovery.  
  
**Creating or Distributing Deepfakes.** Generating or disseminating content that alters the identity of individuals in a manner that could mislead users about the authenticity of the content. This includes manipulating voices, images, or videos of celebrities and political figures.  
  
**Identity Manipulation.** Using Artificial Intelligence (aka, “AI”) to modify the appearance, voice, or actions of individuals without explicit consent, thereby potentially infringing on personal rights and privacy.  
  
**Misleading Content.** Publishing any synthetic media that could confuse users regarding the truthfulness of events, statements, or identities. This is particularly critical for content involving public figures and celebrities, where authenticity matters.  
  
**Spam.** A frequent posting of meaningless content - textual or audio/video - will lead to account suspension and investigation, which may result in subsequent account termination. We reserve the right to determine the meaningfulness of the published information.  
  
**Harm to this Service.** Any unfriendly, offensive, obscene, derogatory, degrading remarks, public messages, comments or posts - within this Platform or elsewhere - that aim to offend, slander or attack our good name and reputation, or otherwise bring harm to this Service, the operating Company or its staff, members or partners, will lead to instant and permanent termination of the account, most likely followed by the legal actions against the perpetrator(s).  
  
**Dangerous Activities.** Any User caught in the act or convicted of making credible violent threats, committing violent crimes, child abuse, violence against animals, malicious doxing, coordinating violent or nonviolent harm, participating in civil unrest, or encouraging others to do any of these activities, may be suspended/banned from using this Service. All activities that can put viewers in danger - by action or inaction - must include a clear disclaimer that warns against repeating such stunts.  
  
**Criminal Activities.** People with a proven criminal history or with a known affiliation with violent or dangerous groups (e.g., organized criminal groups, terrorist or cyber-terrorist organizations, illegal militias, mercenary organizations, violent hate groups, etc.), won’t be onboarded and will be terminated upon discovery such activities, without regards to the declared purpose of the corresponding profile.  
  
**Inactivity.** We reserve the right to suspend - with possible following termination, with or without prior notice - any content creator’s account/profile, that was inactive without prior notice - to us or to its Subscribers - for more than 30 days. All recurring billing will be paused. All collected pledges that are subject to payout will be processed within 30 calendar days upon payout request. In case when conditions for the payout are not met - all pledges will not be reimbursed whatsoever and will remain in the Service.  
  
**Deviations.** We reserve the right to suspend - with or without prior warning - any content creator’s account/profile, that displays, hosts or advertises content that is drastically deviated from the type of content approved during the onboarding process.  
  
**Call to Group Actions.** It’s strictly prohibited to ask anyone on the Platform - Subscribers or Stars - to request a refund, unsubscribe, leave Platform or initiate legal action against the Platform or participate in such actions.  
  
**Profile / Account Ghosting.** It’s strictly prohibited to create an account/profile with the same, new, or altered credentials after an initial account/profile by this particular Star/User was terminated, suspended, or otherwise disabled. For instance, if the profile "X" was terminated, it is prohibited to create a new profile "Y" by the same individual, organization, and/or any other associated entity.   
  
**Permanent Absence.** Upon receiving a piece of reliable information about a particular Star being deceased or otherwise permanently had lost the ability to operate this Service, we reserve the following rights:

1. No payout request will be accepted made on behalf of the deceased Star.
2. No payments will be processed toward the subscription or commissions to this profile.
3. The payments made prior to the billing termination are not eligible for refunds.

### Onboarding Stars

To start posting/publishing on this Platform, you have to become a Star.  
  
We provide our Service only to the Stars whose profiles/accounts are approved.

### Copyright

We do not review, audit, revise, or curate content published on SubscribeStar.com to determine if it is a fair use case (ref. to "Limitations on exclusive rights"), but we will normally remove the reported content if we receive a valid DMCA takedown notice.  
  
If you believe that a content creator on our Service is infringing on your copyright, please send a DMCA takedown notice to [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to have the content removed. This notice must comply with the requirements of section 512(c)(3)(A) of the DMCA. Such notice will be immediately passed on to the content creator responsible for the creating/publishing of the artwork in question.

You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service or any contact on the website through which the Service is provided, without the express written permission by us, unless we stated otherwise.

* * *

If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions (e.g. contest entries, proof of creative body of work, etc.) or without a request from us you send creative ideas, suggestions, proposals, plans, or other materials, whether online, by e-mail, by postal mail, or otherwise (collectively, “comments”), you agree that we may, at any time, without restriction, edit, copy, publish, distribute, translate and otherwise use in any medium any comments that you forward to us. We are and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain any comments in confidence; (2) to pay compensation for any comments; or (3) to respond to any comments.  
  
You are solely responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you or any third-party.

* * *

### Recurring Billing

The subscription mechanism of this Service is based on recurring billing.  
  
The recurring billing is enabled automatically after a Star gets five active Subscribers.  
  
Until then, the existing Subscribers have to manually initiate charge by going to [My Subscriptions](https://www.subscribestar.com/subscriptions) page and hitting the Pay action link found against the name of the Star in question in the Active Subscriptions section.  
  
The exact recurring charge date is not connected to the month's start nor to the end of it, but rather to the moment when subscription event has occurred. The recurring billing date is determined by the Service at our sole discretion. Normally, recurring billing for each subscription runs roughly every 30 calendar days for each subscription instance.  
  
We reserve the right to suspend a recurring billing for the following cases:

* When profile (i.e., Star) is not active for whatever reason for more than 14 days.
* If any activity associated with the account and/or profile are considered suspicious. To determine transactions or activities suspicious, we may take into consideration any data provided to us by third parties or base our decision upon our own internal investigation.

* * *

### Commissions

The Commissions is the form of a one-off pledge, that is dissociated from any subscription tier or subscription fee and can be set as a one-time payment with an arbitrary amount of money, up to $100 at once. Commissions are made for work that is already done or will be done in the future.  
  
Commissions can be made by anybody to the Star who has Commissions feature manually enabled by the Service staff.  
  
We are not obliged to enable the Commissions feature while reserving the right to disable it at any moment.  
  
We take up to 30 calendar days to review Commissions before processing and landing funds to Star’s account.

* * *

### Subscriptions

The subscription fee (i.e., price of monthly subscription) will be charged according to the billing model chosen by the Star and introduced to the Subscriber upon subscription.  
  
The number of payments paid by the Subscriber and the total amount depends on the first date of each billing cycle and settings, whether it should be paid instantly upon subscription or otherwise.  
  
A monthly billing cycle can be defined as 28, 30, or 31 days regardless of the number of days in the following or current calendar month.  
  
When a Subscriber changes the subscription tier, a new subscription is initiated, canceling the initial one. In other words, Subscribers pay as if they subscribe for the first time following the current billing model chosen by the Star.  
  
Every subscription has its own date and time, therefore multiple subscriptions will result in multiple charges, rather than in one batch charge.  
  
Prices for subscriptions are subject to change by Stars without notice. Any further disputes in regard to subscription price changes must be handled by the Subscribers with the Stars (i.e., content providers) directly via available e-mail or direct messaging. Please, refer to our [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
By becoming a Subscriber, you confirm that you use your own payment method that issued in your name and belongs to you. Subsequently, you agree to comply with our payment processors’ rules and regulations in their entirety.  
  
None of the monthly subscriptions can run unverified and without a manual renewal by the Subscribers longer than 365 or 366 days for a leap-year, whichever is applicable.   
  
Every subscription must be reviewed and manually renewed by the associated Subscriber at least once per year. This must be done on or before December 31st, or whenever requested by the Platform.  
   
The renewal is done via mechanism and on a schedule provided by the Platform. Both mechanism and a schedule are unequivocally presented to each active Subscriber within the Platform and are applied to every subscription individually.  
   
The subscriptions will be put on hold until further developments if failed to be renewed in a timely manner. Upon subscription hold being initiated, all associated inbound and outbound funds flow will be stopped.  
  
If and when our attempt to charge the current payment method fails, we will repeat such an attempt within the next few hours. When such attempts are unsuccessful, the selected payment method is deemed faulty and will be marked as such in the Payment Options section of the Account Settings page. To continue with the existing and future subscriptions, you will have to adjust a payment method by adding a previously used but updated credit/debit card. Alternatively, you can add a new card. As soon as this change happens, we will automatically repeat our attempts to charge your updated preferred payment method unless the recurring billing was disabled.  
  
We may, at our sole discretion, limit or cancel subscriptions.

* * *

### Unsubscriptions

The Subscriber can cancel subscription (i.e., unsubscribe) at any time.  
  
Upon unsubscribing from the Star, the Subscriber will lose access to the subscribed materials.  
  
If you believe you deserve a refund for a canceled subscription (i.e., unsubscription), please, refer to our  [Refund Policy](https://www.subscribestar.com/refund) for further information.  
  
Upon subscribing again to the same profile - no matter how short the period of time was between unsubscription and re-subscription - the Subscriber will be charged full price for the new subscription according to the subscription price set on the profile.

* * *

### Cancellation Policy

1. Subscribers can cancel their subscriptions at any time, either immediately or by scheduling the cancellation for the end of the paid period.
2. If these Terms of Service are violated by the Subscriber, the connected subscription(s) may be put on hold or terminated along with the related Subscriber's account.
3. While Stars can’t delete profiles with paid subscriptions, they may want to schedule such deletions instead. The profile will be deleted on the last day of the paid period, and all related subscriptions will be subsequently canceled.
4. When a refund is issued for a subscription, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. In certain cases, such cancellation might be final and irreversible.
5. When a chargeback is initiated by the Subscriber, the related subscription will be automatically terminated. Such cancellation is final and irreversible.
6. If a Subscriber requests cancellation of the subscription while reaching out via their registered and verified email account, and provides enough information, such subscription might be canceled. Email requests are the only reliable communication accepted for such cases.
7. Subscriptions will be put on pause and potentially canceled if the Subscriber hasn’t paid for the subscription or if the system has failed to charge the related account.
8. If a Subscriber isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Subscriber wasn’t using the subscription, we might cancel such a subscription.
9. If a profile the Subscriber has access to isn’t active and evidence suggests that the Star wasn’t using the Platform, we might cancel such subscription(s).

### Fees for Subscribers

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Subscriber with our Service.   
  
You can cancel your pledge (i.e., subscription) at any time.   
  
As a Subscriber, you will be charged Subscription Fee instantly upon subscription or according to the charging model selected by the Star. Thereafter, this fee will be debited from your preferred payment option on a monthly basis (roughly - every 30 days). Depending on your location, some banks may charge you a Foreign Transaction Fee for your pledge, which will be assessed in addition to the pledge amount.   
  
The Foreign Transaction Fee is subject to change by the authorized institutions without prior notice. We have no control over this charge.   
  
If the Subscriber ordinarily resides in the country or territory that requires collecting VAT, then VAT will be added to the final amount.  
  
The specific VAT amount depends on the country, county, and city of supporters' residences. Supporters will see the exact VAT amount when setting up their initial pledge (i.e., Subscription or Commission).   
  
We reserve the right to modify existing VAT rates or apply VAT to Subscribers' contributions in compliance with relevant tax regulations.   
  
We also reserve the right to deduct the VAT amount from incoming transactions when required.  
  
The Platform collects the necessary taxes and then distributes them in line with the applicable rules and regulations.

* * *

### Fees for Stars

There is no fee to start and run an account as a Star with our Service.  
  
As a Star, you will need to set a Subscription Fee during the registering process. You can change this fee at any time unless you have existing active subscribers. The upper limit for the Subscription Fee is $100.  
  
Payment Processing Fees of 2.9% + $0.3 (3.5% + $0.3 for amounts greater than $30) will be applied to each transaction (i.e., Subscription, Commission) made toward Star's account. This amount will be deducted from the Star's monthly earnings during the Payout.  
  
Additional fees may be associated with the Payout (see “Payouts”).

* * *

### Subscription Tiers

To gradually reward your Subscribers, you can set a few Subscription Tiers, each with a different Subscription Fee.  
  
As a Subscriber, you can switch to a higher (i.e., upgrade) or lower (i.e., downgrade) Subscription Tier at any time, if multiple Subscription Tiers are set by the Star.  
  
While upgrading, the price difference between the Tiers will be debited from the preferred payment method; when downgrading, there won't be any credits issued for the price difference.

> Downgrading will result in instant revocation of access to all content previously available from the higher Tier.

  
Charges and billing date changes, or the absence of such, will be indicated during the upgrade or downgrade, so the Subscriber can make a conscious choice before proceeding with a switch.

* * *

### Payouts

**General Statements**

Payout is a process of sending funds collected on the Star's account to a chosen by this User financial instrument or institution (e.g., bank, eWallet).   
  
The payout can be issued exclusively to a person or organization that is the User who initially registered the account with the Service and who conducts the actual content publishing activities within the Platform.  
  
While in some exceptional cases, the payout can be issued to the payee different than the original User, there is no guarantee we will do that.  
  
We cannot transfer the funds accumulated in one Star's account to another Star's account. If such a transfer was previously requested and executed, and if the sending Star is eligible for a 1099-K, the form will only reflect payments processed for that specific Star. In other words, any transfers from that Star to other content creators will not be included in the 1099-K.  
  
If we deem the information in our possession is insufficient for payout purposes, we may request additional identification or proof of substance from the payee. Such documents may include Driver's License, State ID, National or International Passport, Citizenship, or National ID Card for individuals. And for the organization, the Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of Organization, or any other similar company formation documents may be requested.  
  
These documents are requested by our processing partners, who are subject to regulations by the higher financial authorities of the corresponding countries (e.g., the card brands, banks, NACHA, The Financial Conduct Authority, and similar institutions). The requesting entity checks all received information against Money Laundering Act and other applicable policies.   
  
For the cases when the payout wasn't delivered, we may request proof of such a non-delivery in the form of a bank statement for the related period.  
  
Providing this information may prevent our Users from being flagged as sanctioned individuals or organizations that belong to OFAC list, ones linked to fraud or other unlawful affairs.  
  
A User must meet the following criteria to be eligible for payouts: 

* Active profile (consistently deliver content or service to subscribers).
* Acceptable level of requested refunds (your subscribers shouldn’t have a trend of requesting refunds).
* Acceptable level of chargebacks (not going over 1% of total transactions with initiated chargebacks).
* Submitted and verified Taxpayer Forms (W-9, W-8BEN, or W-8BEN-E, whichever applicable).
* Verified identity if requested (verification depends on a country of residence).
* The payout information is filled out in full and verified.
* A selected Payout Vendor can serve the User in their country of residence.
* The User doesn’t violate the Payout Vendor’s terms of their service.
* A selected Payout Vendor can provide the service of sending funds from the Service’s account.

  
**Additional conditions**

1. The related profile has at least 5 actively paying subscribers (can be subject to change per User request)
2. The profile has at least USD150 in pledges collected (we may apply exceptions for different regions; for example, the limit for creators from the United States can be set to USD30)
3. At least 14 days have passed since the Star's account was initially approved
4. At least 14 days have passed since we successfully processed the previously submitted payout request (we make exceptions per User request and often automatically lower this limit to 7 days)

Star must submit a request on the Payouts page to initiate the payout process.  
  
The exceptions from these conditions can be made upon request sent to [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  
  
We reserve the right to deny or pause payout to any User until the matters in question are resolved, if:

* The User failed to provide us with all required and requested information.
* If the information provided is false, omitted, incomplete, or suspicious in any other way (each as determined by the Service in its sole discretion).
* Whenever requested by the Service, the User failed to prove that all related activity on the Service is lawful, as governed by state or province of residence or by international law. 

  
**Timeframe**

Processing payout and delivering funds to the Star’s bank account will take the time that depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star’s account.

For the very first payout request, or when a payout method was changed or updated, there will be a 5 (five) business days delay from the date these changes took place. We use this time to verify the information associated with the changes/updates.  
  
Payouts of less than USD20,000.00 will be initiated within the next 14 business days (on average it takes about 5 business days), following the day the request was submitted. Business days are counted based on the United States holidays/weekends official calendar as well as payment vendor’s and Star’s side. It may take up to 14 business days for the payout to reach your bank account. Typically for ACH transfers it takes 1-3 business days, and for Wire - 1-10 business days.

We may decide to break down to a few separate payments any payout requests that are equal to or more than USD20,000.00. We take no less than 14 business days to process such batch payment.

> Whenever we detect an increased number of refunds toward a particular Star's profile or identify a risk of such an event happening in the foreseen future, we reserve rights to extend the payout processing period beyond 14 business days.

  
The amount equal to 10% of all funds collected by any particular Star can be held for 30 days without being able to be requested for disbursement if and when:

1. The refund rate related to this Star deemed to be “significant” by the Service
2. The content, advertised and promised to be delivered by this Star has failed to be delivered in a timely manner

To prevent any damages that may occur upon possible chargebacks, the Service may keep 10% of all effectively collected funds, but no less than USD35, for 30 business days before making them available to be included in the payout request.  
  
We reserve the right to take additional unlimited time to process the payout if:

* The User has submitted incorrect, suspicious, or incomplete Taxpayer Identification forms.
* The User has submitted invalid or incomplete payout details.
* Any third-party institution (e.g., bank) or organization (e.g., money transfer service) involved in the payout process fails or delays in making the payment into the User account.
* The User who submitted the payout request isn't the actual owner of the receiving account. 

  
**Limits**

The minimum amount of the payout request is USD150, and the actual limit depends on the country and payment vendors applicable to the Star account. Please contact support to know more about your specific case.

The highest amount requested for the payout cannot be greater than the balance available for the payout. The balance available for the payout is based on the proprietary algorithms of the Service and may change without notice.

  
**Fees**

The User pays all and any fees and taxes associated with receiving money on their account.

The Service takes the rights to deduct from the payouts:

* Service Fee - 5% of all successfully processed pledges, (i.e., subscriptions, commissions) to the date of payout request.
* Payment Processing Fee (typically is 2.9% + USD0.3 per transaction, 3.5% + USD0.3 for transactions over USD30).
* Payout Fees associated with the payout. The exact amount of this fee depends on the payout option selected by the User, current currency exchange rate, fees set by the related payment vendor.
* The total amount of refunded, disputed, incomplete, failed, fraudulent, suspicious payments/transactions or any expenses caused by such events and circumstances.
* Any payments/transactions made by mistake.
* Any pledges that were not deposited on the Service’s bank account for any reason.

>  If your account experiences an excessive payment decline rate, we reserve the right to recover compensation for any associated extra expenses. Typically, if the decline rate exceeds 12%, the associated transaction fees paid by SubscribeStar will be passed on to the platform integrator (profile owner).  
>   
> If the disputes rate associated with your profile exceeds 0.25%, we reserve the right to suspend the billing processing and hold the remaining balance up to 4 months. 

  
If the payout to the content creator fails due to the reasons other than actions or inactions of the Service, we keep the rights to apply the following rules:

1. A subsequent payout request will be possible not earlier than the Service receives funds returned by the Star's bank to its account in full. This time period is usually less than 2 (two) months but is almost never shorter than 2 (two) weeks due to the differences in processing practices of each financial institution involved in such transaction.
2. All fees associated with such transaction will be deducted from the account of corresponding Star.

Per each transaction, Service takes rights to round:

* Referral Associate commission amount.
* Payout amount.
* Service Fee amount.

Round-off error may vary within USD1.00.  
  

**Inactive Stars**

Those content creators who, in the current year:

a) eligible for a payout (i.e., whose payable balance has reached a threshold of USD150);  
  
AND  
  
b) have not requested a payout within 6 (six) consecutive months for any reason, including wrong or missing information on tax forms, missing mailing address, etc., potentially, are subjects to the following:

1. Billing will be paused, which will effectively prevent these Stars from getting new Subscribers.
2. Some fee will be applied monthly, with funds taken from the remaining balance of the corresponding accounts. This fee originates from the fact that we, as a Company, responsible for paying the relevant out-of-pocket costs related to keeping remaining balances in our business bank account.

  
The aforementioned actions aren't applicable if a Star:

1. Informed us about such inactivity beforehand.
2. Joined the Platform between December 1 and December 31 of the current year.

> Funds collected in a Star's account, if not regularly withdrawn, may be subject to automated remittance. This process will distribute portions of the remaining balance to the last known valid payout account of this Star. 

* * *

### Hiatus

Any Star can take a break in activities on the Platform - to go on vacation, take some time off, or leave for hiatus.   
  
We strongly advise any content creator to inform Service about such a break a few days ahead. 

> It is imperative to announce the upcoming vacation a few days prior to leaving via message in a post pinned to Star's profile on SubscribeStar.

  
When Star leaves for hiatus, and it takes significantly more time than this Star has informed us about before leaving, the following happens:

1. All payouts - if any were in progress or initiated during this hiatus - could be put on hold, to be resumed in 30 calendar days automatically.
2. Recurring billing will be paused until Star returns from the break and informs us about it via [\[email protected\]](https://www.subscribestar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Star can request a payout while being on longer-than-expected leave. 

* * *

### Modifications to the Service and Prices

We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service.  
  
Prices for our services (i.e., Service Fee) are subject to change without notice.

### Dissolution of the Company

In the unlikely event that SubscribeStar is dissolved or ceases operations, the following terms will apply to all content creators (i.e., Stars) with an outstanding balance on their account:

1. **Notification of Dissolution**  
    SubscribeStar will notify all Stars via their registered email addresses and through an announcement on the Platform regarding the dissolution.
2. **90-Day Payout Request Period**  
    \- Stars will have 90 days from the date of the dissolution notice to request a payout of their remaining balance.  
    \- Payout requests must be submitted through the usual payout request procedure (i.e., via the “Payouts” page).
3. **Forfeiture of Unclaimed Balances**  
    \- If a Star does not request a payout within the 90-day period, their remaining balance will be permanently forfeited.  
    \- After the 90-day period, SubscribeStar will retain all unclaimed balances, and these funds will no longer be available for payout.
4. **Provision of Remittance Details**  
    If the Platform doesn’t have available options for paying out the remaining balance to a specific content creator, the content creator must provide their details for remittance via options described in the Notification of Dissolution within 30 days after the public announcement of the dissolution. Failure to do so may result in the inability to remit the remaining balance.
5. **Finality and Waiver of Claims**  
    \- Stars acknowledge and agree that after the 90-day payout request period, they will have no further claim to any balances that were not requested within the designated period.  
    \- By continuing to use the Platform, Stars agree to waive any future claims or legal actions against SubscribeStar regarding unclaimed balances post-dissolution.

  
By using SubscribeStar, Stars agree to these terms in the event of the Company's dissolution and understand the importance of timely action to request payouts within the specified period.
