### General statement

We do not disclose, share, or sell Users’ Personal Information we collected to any third parties for any monetary or commercial benefit.  
  
The terms "you", “yours”, "your" refer to any User - Subscriber, Star, Referral Associate, or visitor - that uses this Website (aka “Platform” or “Service”) in accordance with our Terms of Service.

* * *

### Collected information

We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular User, or device (“Personal Information”). In particular, Service collects and has collected from its consumers within the last twelve (12) months the following categories of Personal Information:  
  

* Personal identifiers - a set of information you provide for subscriptions or during the sign-up process via our Website, including your first and last name, alias (i.e, Nickname), email address, or any personal identifiers you submit to us when communicating with us.
* Transaction information you provide when you make a subscription on this Website, such as your first and last name, and Payment data or Financial Information.
* Financial Information (i.e., Payment data) is the information you provide when you make a subscription or request a payout through our Website, such as your bank account number, and other related data.
* Internet connectivity, usage, and activity information about your use, and the use by any person(s) you authorize or supervise, of our Website, including the content you view, browser device and type, unique device identifier and/or Internet Protocol (IP) address, and information about your interactions with our Website.
* Location information, including geolocation information provided through our Website’s server logs or associated with your Internet Protocol (IP) address, where we are permitted by law to process this information.

* * *

### Payment data

Payment data must be collected before processing subscriptions, refunds, or payouts.  
  
As a Subscriber, you must provide your payment data to our payment processors and other partnering financial institutions. During this process, this Platform does not receive your full card number. Payment processors provide this Platform with a secure token that represents the corresponding User account, payment method’s expiration date, card type, and the last four digits of the card number only. If Users are required to provide their full name to the payment processor, then they also provide us with that information.  
  
To receive payouts via means other than a bank account, our Users (i.e. Stars) have to create an account with one of our payment partners. We will also require bank account information to process payouts for those who chose to proceed with the bank transfer. Users must also provide us with additional information for tax purposes. Depending on Users’ location, they may have to fill out a form with some combination of first and last name, residential address, social security number or employer identification number, country of citizenship, foreign tax identification number, date of birth, nonprofit registration number (for nonprofit businesses), bank account Information, phone number.  
  
All payment data such as credit/debit card and bank information is stored on a PCI-compliant payment gateway services data storage. They maintain this data on secure servers behind a firewall in an encrypted format.  
  
All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands including Visa, MasterCard, AMEX.

* * *

### Sign-up data

 To simplify the sign-up process, Users may also be using their Facebook or Google account. We will ask permission to access basic information from this User’s Facebook or Google account, such as name, email, and profile picture. Users can choose to stop sharing this information with us at any time by going to Facebook or Google to remove SubscribeStar’s access to that account and your ability to log in. 

* * *

### Additional data

You, as a Star, also can choose to add more information to your profile, such as a geographical location, social media links, and anything else under the profile’s description. This information will be viewable and accessible to all of your profile page visitors.   
  
We will store and analyze all such information along with any comments or messages you submit to this Platform while the account is active.

* * *

### Security of your information

The security, integrity, and confidentiality of User’s Personal Information are extremely important to us.  
  
We implemented technical and administrative security measures that are designed to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, misuse, unlawful disclosure, destruction, and unwanted modification while following the industry's best practices.  
  
If you provide us with your Financial Information, this data is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with AES-256 encryption. We do not possess, store or use the full set of your Financial Information within our Service.  
  
Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards. We also undergo a strict PCI compliance inspection regularly to ensure your information is well protected.

* * *

### Sharing information internally

#### Sharing Emails

We reserve the right to share E-mail addresses between connected Users on the Platform.   
  
The connection between Users is defined by their relationships on the Platform. Subscription, referral link, payment, dispute, messages, comments make relationships between Users and give them a limited ability to share emails within the platform.   
  
Subscribers agree to share their E-mail addresses with connected Stars and Referral Associates. Referral Associate agrees to share their E-mail addresses with Stars, while Stars agree to share their E-mail addresses with Referral Associates.   
  
All users agree to share their E-mail addresses with us.

#### Sharing physical addresses

Star can access Subscriber's personal postal address (i.e., shipping address) information only if this Subscriber agreed to share their personal address with all or any Stars they are subscribed to.   
  
The address information can only be used in order to deliver tangible products and cannot be shared by the Star with anyone else, even if the User gave a personal agreement on this.

#### Sharing names and aliases

Star and Referral Associate are unable to see Subscriber's real name unless it is explicitly specified on the Website, or the name is willingly and openly published by the Subscriber.  
  
Subscriber will be identified by Stars and by the Service by the automatically generated Nickname, in case the Subscriber didn't set their Nickname manually.   
  
Users can set and update the Nickname in the Account Settings upon registration or while subscribing to the Star for the first time. Users can change their Nicknames later at any time.

#### Sharing reports

If Service provides reports, logs, or other information to the User, this information can not be shared with anybody in any way unless the Service permits to do so in a written form. 

* * *

### Third-party services

In general, the third-party service providers used by this Service will only collect, use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us and will be limited by the Terms of Service of this Website.  
  
However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways, banks, and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.  
  
From time to time, we may request additional information related to the Users' identity, activities, or other facets of the existence of a natural person or a legal entity registered with the Platform. We may have obligations to transfer this information to third-party service providers for verification or other actions necessary for further due diligence related to onboarding, inbound payments, or payout processing.  
  
Although we transmit this information via secure channels and take necessary precautionary measures while doing it, we can't guarantee its safety and integrity after a third-party service gets it in possession.  
  
For these providers, it's mandatory that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your Personal Information will be handled.  
  
Remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider (i.e., subscription, refund, or payout), then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.  
  
As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.  
  
Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.  
  
When you click on links on our Platform, they may take you away from our Website, with or without warning. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.

### Data Retention for the EU Content Creators

As required by the applicable laws of each EU jurisdiction, we retain content creators' data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  
  
If any jurisdiction has stricter data sharing and retention requirements, the Platform unconditionally complies with those laws or official directives, regardless of the jurisdiction where the content creator operates.

* * *

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.
