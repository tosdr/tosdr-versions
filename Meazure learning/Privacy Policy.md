This Privacy Policy describes Meazure Learning’s (“Meazure”) policies and procedures for the collection, receipt, use, storage, sharing, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of personal information through our websites, browser extensions, platforms, and applications, and any systems we control, including Scantron systems, (collectively, our “Services”), as well as your rights with respect to the information that we process about you. Meazure may obtain your information through your use of the Services or from your educational institution or certifying entity. When using any of our Services you understand that we will process your information consistent with the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We also may provide you with additional privacy disclosures and ask for your consent for the processing of certain information depending on the Services you are using. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time (see Changes to this Policy below). Your continued use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use our Services.

**Information We Collect**

Contacting Us: When you contact us through an online form, email, or through LiveChat, we will ask, if applicable, for information such as your name, email address, telephone number, job title/position, company name or educational institution, country/region of organization headquarters, current proctoring method, product you want to demo or services in which you are interested, information related to your exam situation, publication, certifying entity, and Meazure status (e.g., test taker, professor, or administrator) and information related to the exam type to be proctored. We may also ask you to provide us with information about the reason you are contacting us. We request this information so that we can accurately respond to your inquiries and address any support needs. We also collect any information you provide within your communications with us.

Downloading Whitepapers, Case Studies and eBooks and Signing Up for Our Newsletter: We may collect your email address and name.

Watching or Registering for Webinars: When you watch or register for one of our webinars, we may collect your name, email address, and company name.

Registering Accounts: When you create or reconfigure a Meazure account or interact with our online portals, we may collect your name, username, password, candidate or user ID, date of birth, gender, language, email address, associated educational institution or certifying entity, contact phone number, fax number, department, title, challenge answer, notes, supervisor name and email address, information related to authored items (including discussions, dates, names, and times associated with the creation of and interaction with authored items or other events within the portals), information related to educational qualifications, information related to employers and previous experience, country of residence, time zone, any information you choose to upload, and for registrants in the United States, your residential address. You can also choose, but are not required, to provide us with additional phone numbers, your full residential address (non-U.S. users), and a profile picture using your device’s camera (instructor registration only). We may also collect information related to your active exams and exam history and any accommodations you request. When you pay for an exam within your account, a third-party entity processes your payment. Meazure may receive records of transactions, including purchase amount, name, and the last four digits of your credit card number. Records of your transactions with Meazure are maintained within your account.

Please note that certain institutions and entities may configure their application instances to collect additional information. For example, certain institutions or entities may ask us to process medical documentation, marriage licenses, driver’s licenses, and social security numbers on their behalf to determine testing eligibility and process candidate results. Our internal policies are designed to protect the confidentiality of personal information, restrict access, and prohibit their unlawful disclosure.

Testing: Before taking an exam, you must download our browser extension, using your username and password. Before your exam you must provide us with access to your device’s camera and microphone and share your screen with our proctors through a LogMeIn File. We require you to share your photo ID on camera so that our proctors can verify your identity. Where your institution or organization requires it, we also use third-party biometric facial recognition software to augment our identity verification process. We also require you to perform a biometric keystroke measurement and answer identity verification questions for some exams if your institution or organization requires it. We use your biometric identifiers solely for identify verification and to ensure the security and integrity of the exams we proctor. Our identity verification providers delete biometric data immediately after each analysis.  Meazure does not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from individuals’ biometric data, and Meazure does not permit its vendors or licensors to sell, lease, trade or otherwise profit from biometric data; provided, however, that Meazure’s vendors and licensors may be paid for products or services used by Meazure that utilize such biometric data. If you would like a copy of our Biometric Information Policy, please contact us at the address in the _Contact Information_ section below. During your exam, we continue to monitor your screen, camera, and microphone in order to meet the requirements of your institution’s testing parameters, communicate with you, and monitor your exam. Meazure may collect recordings of your test session for identity verification, exam integrity, and training purposes. We may also collect information related to test names, dates, results, proctors, status, and duration and other time-based metadata (including the amount of time spent answering each question), name, country, state/province, and city, proctor assessments, and certification number and status. If you opt in to the public display of your certifications, we will publicly display your certification number and status.

Applying for Jobs: When you apply to work for us through our website, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, cover letter, availability, website, blog, or portfolio, LinkedIn profile URL, references (including name, company, and contact info), city and state, resume, work eligibility status, information about whether you will now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status, information about prior employment with Meazure, information about whether you know anyone who works at Meazure (and, if yes, who), compensation range, information about your proximity to the office where you are applying, information about how you learned about the position, and information related to gender, ethnicity, disability, and veteran status. We request this information in order to satisfy our legal obligations and to evaluate your eligibility and qualifications for the open position.

Integrating with Learning Management Systems: When you access or use our Services, including for the purposes of registering for a Meazure-proctored test, through a learning management system integration, we may receive information about you, including information related to the exam, subject, date, registrants, and, if payment is required, payment information (though payment will be processed by our third-party payment processor).

Please note that while you are not required to provide us with your personal information, failure to provide us with certain categories of personal information may render you unable to use some or all of our Services.

**Information Collected Automatically**

Website Log Data: Our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, internet service provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and browser plug-ins. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer our Services, to track users’ movements around the Services and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

Cookies: We use cookies or similar technologies to retain user settings, analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. Our Services do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals except as set forth in the _Right to Opt Out_ sections below. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Services, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Services may be limited. We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking).

Interaction Data: We collect information about your interaction with certain components of our Services, including the resources that you access, pages viewed, how much time you spent on a page, and how you reached our Services. We also log the details of your visits to our Services and information generated in the course of using our Services, such as mouse movements, clicks, page visits, text entered, how long you spent on a page, and other details of your actions.

Third Parties and Tracking Technologies: Some content or applications on the Services are served by third parties. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Services. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across devices and different websites and other online services.

If you have any questions about targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. For more information, see the _Third-Party Sharing_ section below.

Testing: During testing, we automatically track your keystroke pattern to ensure it matches the biometric profile created before the start of your exam if your institution or organization requires it. We also obtain IP address information to help troubleshoot issues and verify your testing location.

**How We Use Your Information**

In addition to the uses described above, we may also use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:

* To present our Services and their contents to you.
* To verify your identity.
* To present our Services and their contents to you.
* To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us.
* To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.

* To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.
* To notify you about changes to our Services or any products or services we offer or provide though it.
* In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.

**Legal Bases for Processing**

In most processing contexts, Meazure acts as a processor or service provider for a controller educational institution or certifying entity. In those situations, we process personal data only on documented legally-compliant instructions from the controller entity. In the limited situations where Meazure acts as a controller, we process your personal information, with your consent, where necessary to perform a contract, to comply with our legal obligations, and where doing so is in our legitimate interest and does not outweigh your rights and freedoms, such as to protect the integrity of our software, protect the integrity of our testing process, protect our intellectual property or the intellectual property of educational institutions or certifying entities, provide and improve our Services, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and our Terms of Service.

**Third-Party Sharing**

Analytics: Meazure uses data analytics providers, including Google Analytics to help understand use of our Services. Google Analytics collects information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. Google also receives this information and their use of it is governed by their Privacy Policy. For more information about how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit [this link](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). To opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics, please visit [this link](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). For more information, please visit Google’s privacy policy [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&fg=1).

Advertising: Our third-party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our website and other websites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out by [clicking here](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/) (or if located in the European Union, [click here](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of all ads, only targeted ads. You will continue to receive generic advertisements online.

Additionally, third parties, including Google (through, for example, our use of Google Analytics Advertising Features on the [meazurelearning.com](https://www.meazurelearning.com/) website, including Dynamic Remarketing), may place and read cookies on your browser, or use web beacons for the purposes of showing our ads on other websites or social media platforms.  These third parties may use first-party cookies or other first-party identifiers and third-party cookies and other third-party identifiers for personalized and non-personalized advertising and measurement. Ad serving may be based on users’ visits to our website or other websites on the Internet, and your activity may be tracked over time and across websites. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. For information about how Google collects, shares, and uses data, please visit: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies or device identifiers by visiting the Google Ads Settings web page at: [http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/). For more information, please visit Google’s privacy policy at: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&fg=1](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&fg=1). You can opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page or control the use of device identifiers by using your device’s settings.

Other Websites and Social Media: We share information with third-party apps and websites that integrate with our API or Services, or those with an API or Service with which we integrate. Our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Meazure. If you submit personal information to any of those websites, your information is governed by their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit. Our website also includes social media buttons and widgets for platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube (for more information about YouTube, see [Google’s privacy policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy), and LinkedIn. These features may collect your IP address, which page(s) you are visiting on our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them.

Your Institution: We may disclose information, including video and audio recording of your exam session, to your educational institution/certifying entity upon request. We do this so that your educational institution/certifying entity can verify that you were the person taking the exam and that no exam protocols were violated.

Service Providers: We may engage certain trusted third parties to help provide and optimize our Services and assist with our testing services, including assessment solutions providers, customer service support providers, human resources software providers, identification verification providers, learning management systems, payment processors, technology support services and technology providers, test administration sites, and webinar software platforms. We share your personal information with these third parties only to the extent necessary for them to perform the functions we have requested. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide services to us in a manner consistent with our Privacy Policy and legal obligations.

Subsidiaries and Affiliates: We may disclose your personal information to our subsidiaries and affiliates.

Legal: In certain situations, Meazure Inc. may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

Contracts: We may disclose your personal information to enforce or apply our Terms of Service, or our other agreements with you.  
Business Transfers: Meazure may transfer information to a third party in the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or similar transaction. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership that affects the processing of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

Other Sharing: We will also share your information when you provide us with consent to do so.

**Data Retention**

We retain information for as long as necessary to perform the Services described in this Policy, as long as necessary for us to perform any contract with you or your institution, or as long as needed to comply with our legal obligations.

**Security**

Once we no longer require information, we securely destroy it. We use commercially reasonable technical, organizational, and administrative measures to protect our Services against unauthorized or unlawful access or processing and against accidental loss, theft, disclosure, copying, modification, destruction, or damage. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee that transmissions of your information will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat the security measures taken by us or our service providers. You play an important role in keeping your information secure. You should not share your user name, password, or other security information for your account with anyone. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please contact us immediately as detailed in the Contact Information section, below.

Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services.

**Children**

Our Services are only provided to children with parental or guardian consent in accordance with applicable law. If you believe that a child has provided their information to Meazure without parental or guardian consent, please contact us as detailed in the Contact Information section, so that we can take steps to delete it.

**Jurisdiction-Specific Rights**

**_International Privacy Rights_**

To the extent required by applicable law, we provide you with the ability to access, correct, export, delete, withdraw consent, object to the processing of, or restrict processing of your personal information, to be informed of the existence, use, and disclosure of your personal information, and to confirm whether we hold any personal information about you. These functions will either be available within our Services, or you can contact us to submit a request. Note that if your request relates to information associated with your exam, you must submit your request through your testing institution or certifying entity as we are not the controller of that information. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable regulations.  
When the processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw or vary your consent at any time, but this will not affect any processing we have already performed.

We may need to obtain or confirm certain personal information in order to accommodate your request. We will not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.  
In most processing contexts, Meazure acts as a processor or service provider for a controller educational institution or certifying entity. In those situations, where required by applicable law, Meazure only transfers personal data to third countries or international organizations where the controller educational institution or certifying entity has authorized Meazure to do so and only where we have taken appropriate steps to ensure your privacy rights continue to be protected in accordance with applicable law.

Lodging Complaints: Pursuant to applicable law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in the EEA, the [Privacy Commissioner](https://www.privacy.org.nz/) in New Zealand, the [Privacy Commissioner](https://www.priv.gc.ca/) in Canada, the [Information Commissioner](https://www.oaic.gov.au/) in Australia, or the [Information Commissioner](https://ico.org.uk/) in the UK if you believe we have processed your personal information in a manner inconsistent with your rights. We kindly request that you contact us first so that we may address your concern.

International Data Transfers: When you use the Services and provide information through the Services, Meazure may transfer your information to a destination outside your jurisdiction, including to the United States. Meazure, including its U.S. subsidiaries, relies on its certification under the Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”), the safeguards set forth in Article 46 of the GDPR, or derogations for specific situations set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR (or other analogous data transfer mechanisms) in order to transfer personal information across international borders. To request a copy of the specific Article 46 agreement(s) governing the transfer of your personal information, please email us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.meazurelearning.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

In all cases, we will ensure that any transfers of personal information will only be undertaken in compliance with applicable data protection laws.  
Information related to EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”): Meazure (which includes all U.S. entities using the Meazure Learning brand name) complies with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Meazure has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

DPF Internal Complaints Mechanism: In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Meazure commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information.
