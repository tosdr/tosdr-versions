These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of website(s), browser extensions, platforms, applications, and other services (collectively, our “Services”) made available to you by ProctorU, Inc. d/b/a Meazure Learning and its affiliates. These Terms also apply to any information, text, audio, video, images, graphics, code, extensions, or other materials created uploaded, downloaded, transferred or otherwise appearing on or connected with the Services when you interact with Meazure Learning, including recordings of any test sessions (collectively referred to as “Content”).

**1\. Using Meazure Learning’s Services**

To use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software, and internet access. Meazure Learning is not responsible for any equipment or network malfunction or service disruption that affects your test session. By accessing or using Meazure Learning’s Services you agree to comply with and to be bound by these Terms. Do not access or use our Services if you do not agree to these Terms. Meazure Learning reserves the right to terminate any user or account and/or to suspend or end access to the Services, without notice to you, if it has reason to believe you have violated these Terms or if it has been validly instructed to do so by your Testing Institution.

**2\. Basic Terms**

You are responsible for your use of the Services and for any consequences thereof. The Services are being provided to you by Meazure Learning for the benefit of your college, university, instructor, school, organization, certification administrator, or other test delivery partner (hereafter, the “Testing Institution”). The Content you submit, post, or display, including all audio and video recordings or images, including any recordings or images of you made by the Services during your test session(s), will be shareable with and viewed by your Testing Institution. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and any applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. The form and nature of the Services that Meazure Learning provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. Additionally, Meazure Learning may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you without prior notice. As a user of the Services, you are prohibited from photographing, or recording, by video or sound, any part of Meazure Learning’s Services for any purpose, unless Meazure Learning has granted you express written permission to do so. You may not remove copies of test questions or test answers, and you may not share or discuss with anyone any of the test questions, test content, or test answers you viewed during your test.

We reserve the right to adjust our fees from time to time, without providing prior notice. The current fee schedule is available through your Testing Institution, and it is fully incorporated herein by reference. The incorporation of the fee schedule, by reference, includes any changes to pricing or availability of choices. Unless your Testing Institution is paying your test session fees directly to us, you are responsible for all fees and costs associated with your use of the Services, including any fees for “premium” services that you select.

**3\. Privacy**

Meazure Learning’s current Privacy Policy (available [here](https://www.meazurelearning.com/privacy-policy)) is expressly incorporated into these Terms by reference. Your use of the Services and any Content that you provide during your interaction with Meazure Learning is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs how your information and any Content you provide is collected and forwarded to your Testing Institution.

**4\. Identity Authentication**

By selecting to use the Services, you agree to provide only true and accurate information to authenticate your identity.

**5\. Connecting to Your Computer**

When you use the Services, Meazure Learning will remotely connect to your computer in order to monitor your computer screen and premises and to ensure no prohibited applications or settings are activated during your examination or test session. As a part of using the Services, you agree to scan your premises using your webcam if or when a proctor request that you do so. The proctor will provide you with reasonable instructions on how to accurately scan your room. You agree to maintain audio and video contact with the proctor during the test session, to enable the Services to record your test session, and to disconnect audio and video contact from the test session once it ends. You authorize us to make all recordings of and any Content from your examination or test session available to your Testing Institution.

If you exhibit unacceptable behavior during your test session, Meazure Learning reserves the right to deny service and report your actions to your Testing Institution. By choosing to use Meazure Learning’s services, you understand and acknowledge that the proctor may immediately terminate your test session if the proctor experiences or observes:

1. Anything that would require termination based on the agreement between your Testing Institution and Meazure Learning; or
2. Any conduct that the proctor deems vulgar, offensive, pornographic, obscene, abusive, criminal, or otherwise inappropriate.

When you choose to use the Services, you grant the proctor the right to use whatever method Meazure Learning makes available to recommend that your examination or test be disqualified if or when the proctor detects suspicious or questionable action(s) during the test session.

**6\. Accounts and Passwords**

In order to use the Services, you may be required to register with Meazure Learning and to create an account. You will receive account confirmation through the email address you provide during registration.

When you create your account, you are agreeing to: (i) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself and (ii) maintain and promptly update your registration information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. Meazure Learning, in its sole discretion, has the right to immediately suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) if:

1. You provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete; or
2. Meazure Learning has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete; or
3. You provide erroneous information.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, you must promptly change your password and immediately notify us by [submitting a ticket](https://support.proctoru.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) through our support center.

**7\. Content**

You are solely responsible for any Content that you originate and transmit while using the Services. Because Meazure Learning does not control user-generated Content transmitted via the Services, we cannot take responsibility for such Content. By submitting, transferring, posting, or displaying Content on or through the Services, you give Meazure Learning permission to use, transmit, display, and distribute such Content to your Testing Institution. You are responsible for how you use the Services, any Content you provide, and any consequences thereof, including the disqualification of your test by your Testing Institution.

No waiver by Meazure Learning of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition.
