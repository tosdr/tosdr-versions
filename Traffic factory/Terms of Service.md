Additional payments are also required as a prepayment, e.g. casting price. The Advertiser may set final preferred target amount (indicated as “**Preferred Daily Max**” or “**Preferred Max Budget**”) in respective order.

For the fair competition an eCPM is calculated as a common value. Under CPM method, Advertisers pay a set remuneration for a thousand Impressions of their advertisement and the eCPM value is equal to the value of Advertiser’s bid.
