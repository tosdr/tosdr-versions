For providing more trust and security we use digital EV (Extended Validation) Certificatesissued by trusted Certificate Authorities. You can see the ‘Green Bar’ in the supported browserversions which confirms what all transmitted data is secure.



Protection of your data in our infrastructure. We make it a priority to develop services thatare secure "by default". The "default" security of our services means that all new services andfeatures are designed with strict security requirements in mind before we even begin

development. This is the key to guaranteed protection and privacy of all data that our serviceshandle and store, once the service or new feature is released.

To secure your data, we use the pseudonymisation which allows most of our services tooperate without using your actual data. Instead of that, our services use a system ID that can'tbe traced back to identify you.

We are always vigilant about the security of your data stored in our infrastructure. Because ofthat we locate all our equipment which is used for your data processing in secure data centers.Network access to this equipment is isolated from the Internet. We use network segmentationfor isolation of services which need different levels of security from each other.

All events that occur in our infrastructureare continuously monitored, analyzed and responded to, which allows us to ensure properprotection of your data, keeping it safe from threats, vulnerabilities, and the effects of malware.

In the event of a failure that affects the accessibility of your data, we have data backup andrecovery procedures in place that will help us restore your data in a short time. To guaranteequick recovery, we use high availability mode enabled for most critical databases which allowsus to minimize downtime.



Employee awareness of data security. Our employees may handle your data in order toprovide you with first-class service. To guarantee the security and confidentiality of your data,we monitor all employees’ actions with access to your data in our systems and grant accessstrictly on a "need to know" basis: only employees who need access will receive it. We holdregular training sessions to make sure that each employee understands the principles that wefollow to achieve robust data security and privacy.



If you choose not to give your personal information. In the context of our businessrelationship we may need to collect data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have withyou. Without this data, we are, in principle, not in a position to close or execute a contract withyou.

If you choose not to give us this data, it may delay or prevent us from meeting our obligations.It may also mean that we cannot perform services needed to run your accounts or policies.



To what extent we carry automated decision-making and profiling. In establishing andcarrying out a business relationship, we generally do not use automated decision-making. Ifwe use this procedure in individual cases, we will inform you of this separately. In some cases,we may proceed with profiling in order to evaluate certain personal aspects. We shall informyou accordingly in case we perform any profiling. In general, any data collection that is optionalwould be made clear at the point of collection.
