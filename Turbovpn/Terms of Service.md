Last updated: 2023.06.23

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of and access to our website (“Website”), applications (“Apps”) and other services (collectively, the “Services”).

The Services are provided by Innovative Connecting Pte. Limited (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “Turbo”). Please note that the Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you ("User" or "You") and Turbo. By visiting our websites, installing, and/or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read the Terms, understand them, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms or any provisions hereof, please do not install the Apps and do not use our Services. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the Terms; and (ii) you agree and consent to the Terms on behalf of the party that you represent.

1\. General
-----------

Our Services are virtual private network (“VPN”) services, which enhance internet security and privacy.

In order to use some of the Services, you will be asked to set up an account. You are solely responsible for all usage or activity on your account including, but not limited to, use of the account by any person who uses your account, with or without authorization, or who has access to any computer on which your account resides or is accessible.

We do not log or store any records on user’s activity using our Services, but if you choose to create a user account, you must provide some basic information, such as an email address and password. If you want to subscribe to our premium services through the official website, you will need to provide certain additional information, such as billing information and country/address. You must maintain and update this information current, truthful, complete, and accurate. You warrant that you are authorized to provide such information. You authorize us to verify your information at any time. If it is found to be untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we retain the right, in our sole discretion, to suspend or terminate your user account and your access to the Services.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, username and password and for restricting access to your account. You may not share your password or other account access information with any other party, temporarily or permanently, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, username or password, as the case may be.

Your use of the Services is at your own risk. We develop our Services by introducing new features or modifying current ones constantly. The Services may be modified, updated, interrupted or suspended at any time without notice or liability. We do not bear any liability for any harm or other adverse consequences to you, caused by this. Turbo, its owners, employees, agents and others that are involved with the Services are not in any way or form liable for any harm of any kind executed or intended, resulting from or arising through or from the use of any account registered with Services.

2\. Modification

All users of Turbo Services are obliged to ensure that they are familiar with the most current wording of the Terms. The change of the Terms may be communicated to you by publishing the updated Terms on Turbo website, where the date of the most current wording of the Terms is indicated at the top of the web page. Since you agree to be bound by these Terms each time you use the Turbo services, please consider reviewing the terms each time when you use the Turbo services. Each update of the terms comes into force as of the moment when it is published on this web page. You understand and agree that any continued use and access to the Turbo Services after any updates to these terms are published, means that you voluntarily agree to be bound by the updated Terms.

6\. Subscriptions
-----------------

By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (“Subscriber”) for the period you have elected. A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the Website and Apps. We reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Website or Apps or sent via email. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive a full payment from you on time. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber’s current subscription period, but may become effective upon subscription renewal, which will be decided solely at the discretion of Turbo. Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies. To find out more about these third party payment companies and how they process your data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

Subscriptions will automatically renew unless you turned off the auto-renew at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period. The subscription fee will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period to the payment method you last selected. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.

7\. Refund Policy
-----------------

(1) If you purchased the Turbo VPN product (or Service) from the Turbo VPN official Website, we offer you a 30-day money-back guarantee. You may cancel your subscription for any reason within 30 days of your initial purchase and you will receive a full refund of the amount you paid. Please note that we do not grant money-back guarantee for the auto-renewed subscription if you cancel the subscription after the day of charge for such auto-renewal, unless applicable law provides otherwise.

Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of Turbo, if you can demonstrate that the Service was not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact Turbo to resolve the issue. In this case, Turbo may provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.

(2) If you purchased our Apps from the Apple App Store (iTunes), the 30-day money-back guarantee is not available. Instead, such subscriptions are subject to Apple's App Store Refund Policy, and you may request a refund through the App Store, at Apple's sole discretion.

(3) If you purchased the Turbo VPN product (or Service) from Google Play Store, you do not have access to the 30-day money-back guarantee. Only if you can demonstrate that the Service was not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact Turbo to resolve the issue, Turbo may provide you with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.

(4) If you purchased the Turbo VPN product (or service) from 3rd party platform (eg: Codashop, or others), your subscriptions will be subject to 3rd party platform refund policies, please kindly contact the respective platform support for assistance.

(5) Your request will be processed without any unreasonable delay and the refund will be paid using the same payment method as the one used for the purchase, except as otherwise mutually agreed, unless applicable law prohibits us or payment service providers we rely on from processing the refund. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the refund will be made in USD. The amount to be refunded in cryptocurrency will be calculated based on the equivalent of the price paid in USD at the time of purchase. Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards will not be refunded if such refund is not supported by the provider of the card. Once the refund is issued to you, you will lose access to the Services for which you were refunded.

(6) If you want a refund or unsubscribe, please do not delete your account before completing the operation. Deleting your account will simultaneously delete all your information in our system, causing the system to be unable to find your order, making it impossible to refund or unsubscribe.

If you have any additional questions or would like to request a refund, feel free to contact us via the in-app feedback system or email us.
