In many instances, the content available on the Services represents the opinions and judgments of the respective third parties, whether or not under contract with Understood. You may enter into correspondence with or participate in promotions of such third parties, such as advertisers promoting their products, services or content on this site. Any such correspondence or participation, including the delivery of and the payment for products, services or content, are solely between you and each such third party. Understood neither endorses nor is responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, submission, posting, or statement made on the Services. Under no circumstances shall Understood, or its affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents, be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on any content or other information obtained through the Services.  

13.2. The Services may integrate and/or interact with third party services, such as via APIs or browser extensions. For example, the Services may leverage APIs from third parties, and/or rely on third party browser extensions, and Understood has no affiliation, association, endorsement, or sponsorship by any other third party services with which it integrates or interacts from time to time (collectively, “Third Party Services”). Understood makes no claim, representation or warranty of any kind, type or nature concerning any Third Party Services, nor Understood’s or any User’s compliance with any third party terms of service for any such Third Party Services (collectively, “Third Party Terms”). It shall be each User’s sole responsibility to analyze and interpret any applicable Third Party Terms and comply therewith. Each User is solely responsible for their interpretation of Third Party Terms and their actions relevant to compliance thereof. By using the Services, you hereby release Understood and waive any and all claims or claim rights that you may have against Understood, and release and indemnify Understood against any claims that any third party may have against you, including with respect to your use of any Third Party Services, including if accessed or used via our Services, and with respect to Third Party Terms, applicable privacy policies or any other rules or regulations of such third parties.

It is up to you to read those third party sites’ applicable terms of use, privacy, and other applicable policies.

14.  CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND ARBITRATION

**THIS SECTION CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH US.**

14.1. Except if you opt-out as expressly permitted below, or except to the extent contrary to applicable law (“Excluded Disputes”), you hereby agree that all disputes between you and us (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with us, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, may, in our discretion, be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. You agree that you shall not participate in any class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this Agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the US Federal Arbitration Act, to the extent permissible. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms. You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: 96 Morton Street, Floor 5 New York, NY 10014

14.2. You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your account with us, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. If and to the extent the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then such preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.

15\. MISCELLANEOUS.

15.1. You shall comply with all laws, rules and regulations now or hereafter promulgated by any government authority or agency that are applicable to your use of the Services, or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. You may not assign your rights or obligations hereunder, and any attempt by you to sublicense, assign or transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder or to exceed the scope of this Agreement is void. In the event that Understood is sold to a third party, such a sale will not be deemed a transfer of personal information so long as that third party agrees to assume Understood’s obligations as to these Terms of Services and any associated Privacy Policy. This Agreement, the Services, and the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the Services will be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding conflict of law principles. By accessing or using any Services you agree that the statutes and laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof, will apply to all matters arising from or relating to the use thereof. You also agree and hereby submit to the exclusive legal jurisdiction and venues of the Courts of New York, New York with respect to such matters. This is the entire agreement between you and Understood with regard to the matters described herein and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and Understood with respect thereto. The failure of Understood to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.  You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of this Agreement or related to use of the Services must be filed within three (3) months after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
