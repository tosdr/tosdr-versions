**Understood for All, Inc.**

**Privacy Statement**

Last updated: 9/14/2023

Welcome to our website. Your privacy is important to us.

This Privacy Statement sets forth our policy with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of information that is collected from you by Understood for All, Inc., a charitable organization, (“we” or “us”) when you visit [www.understood.org](https://www.understood.org/en) or our other digital properties including our apps (collectively, the “Site”). The Site provides information about us, our mission and any information or services we provide (together with the Site, the “Services”). This Privacy Statement also explains how we may use and disclose such information, as well as your ability to control certain uses of it. By using this site, you agree to the data collection, use, disclosure and storage practices described in this Privacy Statement.

By using the Site, you agree to the data collection, use, disclosure and storage practices described in this Privacy Statement. We collect information about you in a range of forms, including personal information, when you choose to provide it to us. Personal information (or personal data) means information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include personal information where the identity has been removed (anonymous personal information). This may include when you contact us with inquiries or otherwise contact us.

When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect information from you, as further described below. **The Site is not intended to collect personal health information or other sensitive information about you. Please do not share your personal health or other sensitive information on the Site. We may collect such information from you directly with your consent. The information provided on our Site is also not intended to be used as legal, tax, medical or other professional advice.**

**Information You Provide to Us**

We collect information from you when you choose to provide it to us. This may include when you make a donation, request information from us, sign up for newsletters or our email lists, complete a survey, use our Services, or otherwise contact us. The information we collect may include: your name, address, email address, telephone number, mobile telephone number, geolocation information, photos or videos, username or any other information, such as ethnicity, marital status, login or password.

If you use the Services to make donations, you may provide certain payment information, such as payment card, PayPal or other financial account information, and billing address. A third-party payment processor collects and processes that information on our behalf; we do not collect or retain your payment information. We may also collect additional types of personal information that you choose to provide to us. This could include information about yourself or family members. It’s up to you whether you provide this information. We will not disclose any of this personal information unless you expressly authorize us to do so. We do not sell your information to other parties.

You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, "**posted**") on public areas of the Site, or transmitted to other users of the Site or third parties (collectively, "**User Contributions**").

If you have created an account, you may be able to voluntarily provide additional information in various areas of the Site. For example, you may want to provide additional information as part of an optional profile to enhance your experience and use its features. We may use this information to personalize the Site and its features just for you.

If you wish to access the Site’s community features, you will be required to create a screen name. We suggest you create a screen name that does not include your name or other identifying information. If you post information in public areas, we cannot control how others may use that information. For example, a third party might copy something you post and use it on another website. Or a third party might use the information you posted to contact you. We urge you to use screen names, not real names.

The Site may also offer you the opportunity to create a full profile. Whether you provide information is your choice. We will not disclose the information you provide to us in creating your full profile. We may use it to enhance your experience on the Site and to improve the information and services available to you on and through the Site.

Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Although you may set certain privacy settings for such information by logging into your account profile, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Site with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

**Information Collected From Other Sources**

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including social networks that you use to connect with Us. If you use a third party service to login, link to us, or communicate with us (such as a social network or third party video chat), we may receive certain information about you from the third party based on your registration and privacy settings on those third party services. This information may include name, user name, demographic information, updated address or contact information, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media and online activity.

**Information Obtained from Third Parties**

If you provide us with personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us, for example, if you have agreed to share information with one of our partners, we may add this information to the information we already hold about you.
