**US ONLY: Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

10.1

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND PICMONKEY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.

10.2

This Section 10 is deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and PicMonkey agree that we intend for this Section 10 to satisfy the "writing" requirement of the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 10 can only be amended by mutual agreement.

10.3

We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. Therefore, pursuant to these Terms of Use, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Websites or PicMonkey Services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with PicMonkey, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to PicMonkey or that PicMonkey may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, "**PicMonkey Transactions or Relationships**"), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE OR ENGAGING IN ANY OTHER PICMONKEY TRANSACTIONS OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH US, YOU AND PICMONKEY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

10.4

We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. If those efforts fail, by using our Websites or PicMonkey Services, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against PicMonkey, and any claim that PicMonkey may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, or any PicMonkey Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration ("Arbitration") administered by JAMS or its successor ("JAMS") and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the "Applicable Rules"). The Applicable Rules can be found at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/). If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor ("AAA") instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the "Applicable Rules" in such circumstances). If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations ("Minimum Standards") in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, PicMonkey agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below. Furthermore, this Section shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. You further agree that:

1. **Single Arbitrator.** The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and PicMonkey ("Arbitrator");
2. **Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement.** The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use and/or these arbitration provisions in this Section hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable;
3. **Location of Arbitration.** The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and PicMonkey; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.
4. **Governing Law.** The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of Washington consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with Washington or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;
5. **No Class Actions.** YOU AND PICMONKEY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and PicMonkey agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding;
6. **Written Award.** The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator’s complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an "Award"). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;
7. **Arbitration Costs.** In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PicMonkey will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;
8. **Reasonable Attorney’s Fees.** In the event you recover an Award greater than PicMonkey’s last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award PicMonkey’s reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees associated with the Arbitration, but PicMonkey shall in all events bear its own attorneys’ fees;
9. **Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause.** With the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor PicMonkey shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction;
10. Modification to this Arbitration Provision. If PicMonkey makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to PicMonkey’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to PicMonkey’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with PicMonkey will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive;
11. **Small Claims Matters are Excluded.** No class relief or joinder of claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against PicMonkey in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court’s jurisdictional limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding;
12. **Opt-Out.** If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 10 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms of Use by sending a letter to Shutterstock, Inc. , Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 1505 5th Ave. Suite 500, Seattle, WA 98101 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Websites or the PicMonkey Services, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once PicMonkey receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 10 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms of Use will be resolved as set forth in Section 9.1. The remaining provisions of these Terms of Use will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice;
13. **Notice of Arbitration; Process.** A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice of Arbitration**”). PicMonkey’s address for Notice is: Shutterstock, Inc. ,1505 5th Ave. Suite 500, Seattle, WA 98101. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or PicMonkey may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or PicMonkey must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by PicMonkey in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, PicMonkey will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000; and
14. **Enforceability.** If Section 10(e) or the entirety of this Section 10 is found to be unenforceable, or if PicMonkey receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 10 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 9.1 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Use.
