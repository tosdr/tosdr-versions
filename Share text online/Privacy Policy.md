#### “Local Storage” Policy

The ShareText.me Service uses “Local Storage” technology in order to increase functionality and usability of the Service. “Local storage” is a location in temporary memory (as key-value data) on the User's device which is available to the User's browser. “Local Storage” may remain on the User's device even after the User has closed its browser, depending on browser settings. “Local Storage” are stored according to the browsers security settings which can be set by the User. The ShareText.me Service uses “Local Storage” mainly to provide the User a functional auto save text (draft) on the User's device to continue to use the text (draft) later, even after the User has closed the browser (if it is technologically possible and is supported by a browser). Browsers which are set to “Never remember history” or “Private Mode” will use “Local Storage” until the browser is closed. In this case, the User will not be able to resume the previously entered text (draft) on the ShareText.me Service after the browser is restarted, because “Local Storage” removed from the User's device.
