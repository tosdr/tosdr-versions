COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT POLICY
=============================

Freelancer respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide Freelancer's Copyright Agent with the information specified below in the form of a "Notification of Alleged Infringement." It is Freelancer's policy to respond to clear Notifications of Alleged Infringement, and our policy is designed to make submitting Notifications of Alleged Infringement as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of Notifications that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. If you are a User (as defined in the User Agreement at [https://www.freelancer.com/about/terms](https://www.freelancer.com/about/terms)) or subscriber and concerned about the removal of or blocked access to your content, please provide Freelancer's Copyright Agent with the written information specified below in the form of a "Counter-Notification." The forms specified below are consistent with the forms suggested by the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Website at [http://www.copyright.gov](http://www.copyright.gov/)).

### DMCA NOTIFICATION OF ALLEGED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

2. Identification of the copyrighted material claimed to have been infringed
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit Freelancer to locate the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity
5. Information reasonably sufficient to permit Freelancer to contact person submitting the Notification, such as a physical address, email address, and telephone number
6. A statement that the person submitting the Notification has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law
7. A statement that the information in the Notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the person submitting the Notification is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed

### DMCA COUNTER-NOTIFICATION

If you elect to send us a Counter-Notification, please send an email or letter to Freelancer's registered Copyright Agent at the email or mailing address below:

Copyright Agent c/o Freelancer, Level 37, Grosvenor Place, 225 George Street, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia 2000 [copyright@freelancer.com](mailto:copyright@freelancer.com)

To be considered effective, a Counter-Notification must be submitted in writing and include the following information:

1. Physical or electronic signature of the User or subscriber or a person authorized to act on behalf of the User or subscriber.
2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
3. A statement under penalty of perjury that the User or subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
4. The User’s or subscriber's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that (1) the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of (a) (for USA addresses) the Federal District Court for the United States of America’s judicial district in which the address is located, or (b) (for non-USA addresses) the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, USA, and (2) the User or subscriber will accept service of process from the person who submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement or an agent of such person.

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the United States Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability. Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of Users or subscribers who are repeat infringers.
