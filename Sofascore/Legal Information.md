5\. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR INFORMATION
-----------------------------------

Your information will only be disclosed to companies within the Sofascore group of companies and third parties outside those groups in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy.

Sofascore may transfer your information to another company if it restructures its business. Sofascore may transfer your information to a third party if the operator of the App changes, or if there is a sale of all or any part of our business or its assets. In the event of any of these transfers occurring, the party who acquires the data will assume the rights and obligations described in this privacy policy.

Sofascore may engage the services of third party service providers and suppliers for certain activities including, but not limited to, processing your information and providing technical support to our Services. For example, we engage service providers to host our Platforms, store data, send marketing communications, carry out data cleansing to suppress our marketing lists, carry out marketing data segmentation, and perform data analytics to measure and understand our audience, tailor our marketing and trading services, and improve your experience of our Platforms. Sofascore will take steps to ensure that arrangements with third party service providers protect your privacy by ensuring that these third parties comply strictly with instructions when they are processing your information. Sofascore may share your Personal Data with third parties who process your Personal Data on our behalf when they provide services to us, for example data analytics, ad networks, financial services and for the purposes of recruitment.

If we offer co-branded services such as promotions, competitions or events, together with or in association with a third party, Sofascore may share the information you provide with that third party. These co-branded services may be hosted by us or by the third party. The third party’s use of your information will be governed by that third party’s privacy policy, which you should always read. This may also provide information about how that third party’s service providers may process your Personal Data. We require all third parties to respect the security of your information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third party service providers to use your information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

6\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
---------------------------

Third parties with whom we share your Personal Data may be based outside the combined area of the United Kingdom ("UK") and the European Union ("EU") and, as such, the processing of your Personal Data may involve a transfer of your Personal Data outside the combined area of the United Kingdom and the EU.

If your Personal Data is transferred outside the combined area of the United Kingdom and the EU, we take steps to make sure it has the same level of protection as it would have in the EU.

7\. OUR ADVERTISING PARTNERS
----------------------------

Some of the advertisements you receive while using the Services are chosen and displayed to your device based on predictions about your interests generated from your visits to different websites in the browser you use and on other devices you may use. This type of ad customisation is sometimes called "online behavioural" or "interest-based" advertising. Such interest-based advertising helps support the free content, products and services you receive via our Services.

When you use our website and enter your email address on our website (either to log in or similar), we may share with solution providers and its group companies information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed, pseudonymous form), IP address, or information about your browser or operating system, with any of the following, acting as “joint controllers” (as applicable and defined in the GDPR). This Site is affiliated with Adapex INC for the purposes of placing advertising on the Site, and Adapex INC will collect and use certain data for advertising purposes.

In order to deliver interest-based advertising that is more likely to be relevant to you, we deploy cookies, web beacons and similar technologies built by such Ad Partners that collect usage data, namely the IP address of your device and the websites visited using that device.

The Ad Partners do not receive any directly personally identifiable information such as your name, address or contact details. Please refer to the Ad Partner's respective privacy policies (via the above links) for more information on how their services work.

They will only process your information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

9\. DATA RETENTION
------------------

### HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY INFORMATION FOR?

We will only retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for (e.g. such as providing you access to our Services), including for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

Where it is no longer necessary to process your Personal Data, we will delete it or anonymise it by removing all details that identify you in accordance with Data Protection Laws. For example, if you withdraw your consent to process your Personal Data, we will delete your Personal Data unless this is required to be retained to enable us to comply with Data Protection Laws.

The length of time for which we retain your Personal Data will depend on what we are using it for as set out in this privacy policy. For example, whilst you are using our products and services, we may need to use it to answer your queries about our products and services.

If you want to know how long we retain information collected via the use of cookies, read our [cookie policy](https://www.sofascore.com/cookies-policy).

Please note, however, that we may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements to keep Personal Data for a longer period, in particular pursuant to any applicable statutory limitation period.
