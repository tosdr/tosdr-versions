Description of Service
----------------------

Bulk Data ("the Service") is part of OpenSecrets.org. OpenSecrets tracks money and other elite influences in federal elections and its effect on policy.

Bulk Data enables registered users to download large data sets and customize certain pages to display money-in-politics data for specific politicians, organizations, Congressional or Presidential races, industries, etc. Future enhancements of the service are expected regularly.

OpenSecrets reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that OpenSecrets shall not be liable to you for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

Modification of Terms of Service
--------------------------------

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change the Terms of Service at any time without further notice. If we do this, we will post the changes to the Terms of Service on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. Your continued use of the Service on or after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.

We do not anticipate that these terms will change frequently.
