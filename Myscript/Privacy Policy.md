### What do we use it for

We use your personal identifying information for the below purposes:

* to allow you to synchronize your Nebo notes to a third-party cloud storage service and/or view or share your Nebo notes through Nebo Cloud, and

### Your Nebo notes’ content

The content of your Nebo notes is automatically stored locally on your device. We have no access to your Nebo notes through your device. MyScript enables you to use Nebo Cloud to view and share your Nebo notes and third-party cloud storage services (such as Dropbox, Google Drive or iCloud) that allow you to synchronize your Nebo notes via these online storage platforms. If you use any available cloud platform, you will be given the choice to enable the sharing of your notes with MyScript. MyScript will only access the content of your Nebo notes if you enable the sharing option in the settings. You may enable or disable this option at any time. If you enable this option, we will pseudonymize the link between your personally identifying information and your Nebo notes so that your notes become anonymous for MyScript research teams. We will still be able to trace your Nebo note back to your account in order to delete your notes either upon your request (contact [legal@myscript.com](mailto:legal@myscript.com)) or automatically when you delete your account. Disabling the sharing option does not delete your notes from our servers. Please note that once deleted it can take up to 12 months for back-up copies to be overwritten. We use the content of your Nebo notes in order to develop, train and improve our algorithm and conduct language-based research. Only specifically authorized people will have access to a note and always anonymously.

Please note that although MyScript research teams will be unable to link your Nebo note to your MyScript account, the MyScript support team may ask your permission to access a Nebo note in order to solve any support ticket that you have opened. In this case the MyScript support team will have to link your note to your MyScript account in order to restitute this note to you.
