Privacy
-------

Your privacy matters to MyScript. Please read our [Privacy policy](https://myscript.com/privacy-policy/) to find out how we protect your privacy.

MyScript has established a data processing addendum (“DPA”), which you can access [here](https://www.myscript.com/dpa). It is an essential component of this Notice and binds both you and MyScript. The DPA clarifies how MyScript safeguards any personal data from third parties that may be included in your User Content and that you have shared with us through our Services. Additionally, the DPA outlines your obligations concerning this personal data.

Nebo’s AI Features are powered by OpenAI. If you have access to AI Features and decide to insert all or any part of your User Content into these AI Features you are also uploading and sharing this User Content with OpenAI. You User Content will be treated in accordance with **[OpenAI’s data usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).** Your User Content is not systematically shared with OpenAI, only the specific part of the User Content that you select and upload into the AI Features.

Account use and deletion
------------------------

MyScript does not permit interference with the Services. You agree to use the Services in a proper and correct manner according to our instructions in our interface. MyScript reserves the right, without further notice, to refuse to create or to decide to delete an account that provides access to our Services to users that compromise or are likely to compromise the proper functioning of the Sites and/or Services or users that cause prejudice to MyScript in any other way. MyScript equally reserves the right, without further notice, to delete an account or remove content which MyScript considers to be illegal, infringing and/or inappropriate, with or without notification from the appropriate authorities.

Using MyScript Services for spamming or sending unsolicited emails such as promotions, advertisements or illicit content will not be tolerated. In this event, MyScript reserves the right to delete your account immediately without further notice and may report such behavior to the appropriate authorities. You are responsible for managing your email contacts in Nebo Cloud and any other personal data you upload or share with the Services in accordance with the DPA. This includes responding to any requests for deletion, transfer, modification or access, and acquiring all the necessary consents, such as the consent to transfer personal data to MyScript and to third-party companies situated in countries outside of the European Union. MyScript shall respect its obligations as a data processor and/or controller under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), notably by enforcing any request for deletion of personal data. Please note that all personal data will be deleted once your account is deleted.  

MyScript may decide at any moment to stop offering the Services. We will inform you at least sixty (60) calendar days beforehand of the termination of the Services. During this period you may transfer your content to another service or device. Once this period is finished you will not be able to access the Services, including all your User Content.     

AI Features: usage and limitations
----------------------------------

If you have access to the AI Features please note that this access is granted under a beta testing program. Your usage is limited to a reasonable number of requests. If your usage exceeds this reasonable use, the Service may be limited, paused or stopped without further notice to you. MyScript may decide to stop the beta testing program at any time or to make the Service available subject to the payment of additional fees. In this case we will notify you and update this Notice. The content generated through the AI Features is generated by a computer system and may not always be correct.

Your use of the AI Features is governed by OpenAI’s [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).
