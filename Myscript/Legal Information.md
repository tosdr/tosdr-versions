If you choose to visit the Sites, you will be agreeing to abide by all of the terms and conditions of this Notice between you (“you” or “your”) and MyScript (“MyScript”, “us” or “we”).

License and access to the Sites and Services
--------------------------------------------

The contents of the Sites and Services are intended for your personal and non-commercial use only. All materials or information published on the Sites including, but not limited to, any news article, documentation, audio clips and video clips, graphics, logos, icons, images or downloads contained therein (also known as the “Content”) are protected by copyright, and owned or controlled by MyScript or the party credited as the provider of the Content. You shall abide by all additional copyright notices, information, or restrictions contained in any Content. You may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as provided in the below paragraph), create derivative works, distribute, perform, display, or in any way exploit, any of the Content or the Sites, in whole or in part, without MyScript’s prior written approval.

You may download or copy the Content and other downloadable items displayed on the Sites for your personal use or non-commercial use only, provided that you maintain all copyright and other notices contained therein.

You need to create a MyScript account to access some of our Services (Nebo Cloud, AI Features, MyScript developer portal). This account may be used across all of our Services.

Copyright, trademarks and intellectual property rights
------------------------------------------------------

### MyScript

The Sites, all Content included in or made available through the Sites and/or Services shall remain the property of MyScript or its content suppliers and is protected by French and international copyright law, authors’ rights and database right laws. Graphics, logos, page headers, button icons, and product names included in or made available through the Sites are trademarks or registered trademarks of MyScript. All other trademarks not owned by MyScript that appear on the Sites and/or Services are the property of their respective owners.

### You

You retain all right, title, and interest in and to any content that you create, upload, share or transfer via the Services (“User Content”). This includes any content generated through the AI Features. By enabling the sharing option in your privacy settings in the Services, you grant to MyScript a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free and fully-paid, transferable and sublicensable, perpetual, and irrevocable license to copy, store, modify, create derivative works of and use your User Content in connection with the provision of the Services, and also to develop, improve and train our algorithms and conduct language based research. Only specifically authorized people within MyScript will have access to your User Content, and we always hash the link between your account and your User Content. Your shared User Content is deleted from our servers either upon your request, or automatically when you delete your account. Disabling the sharing option does not delete your User Content from our servers. Once you delete your account, it can take up to 12 months for back-up copies to be overwritten. Any derivative works created from User Content will not be deleted. Equally, you grant the right to MyScript to use our automated systems to analyze your User Content in order to provide us with analytic data concerning your User Content (for example, number of pages stored).

We expect that all our users respect copyright and other intellectual property rights. If you breach such rights, MyScript reserves the right to remove the offending content or delete your account without notice. If you notice a breach of your copyright through our Service, please contact [legal@myscript.com](mailto:legal@myscript.com) providing evidence and an explanation of the breach.

If you, in your sole discretion, provide any feedback to MyScript concerning the functionality and performance of the Sites and/or Services (e.g. identifying potential errors, enhancements or improvements) (“Feedback”), MyScript shall be entitled to use your Feedback for any purpose without restriction or remuneration of any kind with respect to you. In the event that you decide to provide Feedback to MyScript you shall keep this Feedback confidential and not share it with anyone else.

Privacy
-------

Your privacy matters to MyScript. Please read our [privacy policy](https://www.myscript.com/privacy-policy/) to find out how we protect your privacy.

MyScript has established a data processing addendum (“DPA”), which you can access [here](https://www.myscript.com/dpa/). It is an essential component of this Notice and binds both you and MyScript. The DPA clarifies how MyScript safeguards any personal data from third parties that may be included in your User Content and that you have shared with us through our Services. Additionally, the DPA outlines your obligations concerning this personal data.

Nebo’s AI Features are powered by OpenAI. If you have access to AI Features and decide to insert all or any part of your User Content into these AI Features, you are also uploading and sharing this User Content with OpenAI. Your User Content will be treated in accordance with [OpenAI’s data usage policies](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/). Your User Content is not systematically shared with OpenAI, only the specific part of the User Content that you select and upload into the AI Features.

Account use and deletion
------------------------

MyScript does not permit interference with the Services. You agree to use the Services in a proper and correct manner according to our instructions in our interface. MyScript reserves the right, without further notice, to refuse to create or to decide to delete an account that provides access to our Services to users that compromise or are likely to compromise the proper functioning of the Sites and/or Services or users that cause prejudice to MyScript in any other way. MyScript equally reserves the right, without further notice, to delete an account or remove content which MyScript considers to be illegal, infringing and/or inappropriate, with or without notification from the appropriate authorities.

Using MyScript Services for spamming or sending unsolicited emails such as promotions, advertisements or illicit content will not be tolerated. In this event, MyScript reserves the right to delete your account immediately without further notice and may report such behavior to the appropriate authorities. You are responsible for managing your email contacts in Nebo Cloud and any other personal data you upload or share with the Services in accordance with the DPA. This includes responding to any requests for deletion, transfer, modification or access, and acquiring all the necessary consents, such as the consent to transfer personal data to MyScript and to third-party companies situated in countries outside of the European Union. MyScript shall respect its obligations as a data processor and/or controller under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), notably by enforcing any request for deletion of personal data. Please note that all personal data will be deleted once your account is deleted.

MyScript may decide at any moment to stop offering the Services. We will inform you at least sixty (60) calendar days beforehand of the termination of the Services. During this period you may transfer your content to another service or device. Once this period is finished you will not be able to access the Services, including all your User Content.

AI Features: usage and limitations
----------------------------------

If you have access to the AI Features, please note that this access is granted under a beta testing program. Your usage is limited to a reasonable number of requests. If your usage exceeds this reasonable use, the Service may be limited, paused or stopped without further notice to you. MyScript may decide to stop the beta testing program at any time or to make the Service available subject to the payment of additional fees. In this case we will notify you and update this Notice. The content generated through the AI Features is generated by a computer system and may not always be correct.

Your use of the AI Features is governed by [OpenAI’s Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/).
