DMCA Policy



Consumer Cellular, Incorporated (“Consumer Cellular,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) has established the following

process for addressing copyright infringement claims in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright

Act of 1998 (“DMCA”) under Title 17 U.S.C. §§ 512 of the U.S. Copyright Act, the text of which can be

found on the U.S. Copyright Office website. We are committed to complying with U.S. copyright law and

take the intellectual property rights of others seriously.



DMCA notice requirements. If you own a copyright and want to report a claim that a user is infringing

your copyrighted work, and the work has been transmitted through or stored within any system or

network maintained by Consumer Cellular, please send our authorized copyright agent (“Designated

Agent”) a notice of claimed infringement that meets the minimum requirements of the DMCA.



Copyright owners may send Consumer Cellular a notification of claimed infringement to report alleged

infringements of their works to:

We will review your submission and take whatever action we deem appropriate under the DMCA,

including removal of the challenged content from our system or network.

contemplated by the DMCA. Therefore we are not obligated to respond to any demands regarding and

have no duty to block, or remove or disable access to, material that is transmitted over, routed over or

via connections to our network, by a user or at a user’s direction or initiation.



DMCA counter notice requirements. If a notification of claimed infringement has been filed against you,

you can file a counter notification with our Designated Agent using the contact information shown above.

All counter notifications must satisfy the requirements of the DMCA. Upon receipt of a counter

suspend or terminate the services of any user who is deemed to be a repeat copyright infringer in our

sole judgment.
