---------------

This privacy policy applies between you, the User of this Website and Tiphereth Ltd, the owner and provider of this Website. Tiphereth Ltd takes the privacy of your information very seriously. This privacy policy applies to our use of any and all Data collected by us or provided by you in relation to your use of the Website.

#### Please read this privacy policy carefully.

Your privacy is important to us. It is Tiphereth Ltd’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, https://www.tiphereth.org.uk.

We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.

We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third parties, except when required to by law, or where we need to do this for practical purposes.

Here is a list of the times we collect your information:

1. When you make a donation we record your name, address and email address. If you are making a one-off payment we do not store your card details once the payment has been authorised. If you are making a regular donation by Direct Debit then our Direct Debit provider holds your bank information. This data is held on databases hosted by Blackbaud Inc, the owner of JustGiving and our database system).
    
2. When you order firewood or compost we will retain your name and address details in order to make the delivery. Your card details will be processed but not retained by us once the payment is authorised. You will be given the option to join our mailing list to be told when new supplies of wood are available for sale.
    
3. When you join our newsletter mailing list we will record your email address, and sometimes your first and last name. This data is held by Squarespace Inc. wh provide our mailing list service. You may unsubscribe at any time by following the link at the end of each newsletter.
    
4. When you contact us using the contact form on our website we will store your name and email address until we have responded to your enquiry.

5. When you apply for a job, or a volunteer role with us, we will collect considerable personal information from you. This will normally be sent by you to us by postal mail or email. But for the avoidance of doubt: we only retain your data until the recruitment process is complete. If you are unsuccessful it will be deleted. If successful, it will become part of your personnel file.
