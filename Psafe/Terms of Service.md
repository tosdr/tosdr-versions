13\. **Dispute Resolution. Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (‚ÄúArbitration Agreement‚Äù) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with PSafe and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.**

13.1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with PSafe, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or PSafe may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).

The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys‚Äô fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS‚Äôs most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ all other claims shall be subject to JAMS‚Äôs most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS‚Äôs rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

13.3. Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and PSafe. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum‚Äôs rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

13.3. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. YOU AND PSAFE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and PSafe are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified herein. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

13.4. WAIVER OF CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER LICENSEE. In the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court as set forth herein.

13.5. Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with PSafe.

13.6. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if PSafe makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to PSafe.

13.7. Exclusive Venue. To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and PSafe agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California.

14. **Export**

14.1. You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Services except as authorized by applicable laws.

17\. **Miscellaneous**

17.1. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word ‚Äúincluding‚Äù means ‚Äúincluding without limitation‚Äù. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any provision of these Terms of Use is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to PSafe is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms of Use, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without PSafe‚Äôs prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. PSafe may freely assign these Terms of Use. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Use shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon permitted assignees. It is the express wish of the parties that these Terms of Use and all related documents have been drawn up in English. Where PSafe requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing PSafe with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to PSafe is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by these Terms of Use, PSafe‚Äôs dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to PSafe at the address set forth below. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by PSafe by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address. If you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Services, please contact us at the address below. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel that your concerns have been addressed incompletely, we invite you to let us know for further investigation. All provisions of the Terms of Use which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of the Terms of Use, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.

18\. **Force Majeure**

18.1. Neither PSafe nor its affiliates, suppliers or licensors will be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
