YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL AGREEMENTS AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO ANY ADDITIONAL SERVICES.

###### **4\. Company’s Responsibilities.**

**4.1.** **Acceptable Use.** For the Term and within the scope provided in the Order Form, the Services will include the right for Company to generate, view and use analytics and reports for internal business use only. The information, reports, and analytics generated, viewed or received by authorized users on the Talkwalker Platform, constitute “Generated Reports” which Company acknowledges may quote or incorporate excerpts of certain material owned by Third-Party Platforms. Company and its authorized users must access and use the Services and the Generated Reports in accordance with the Basic Conditions of Use (located at [https://www.talkwalker.com/basic-conditions-of-use](https://www.talkwalker.com/basic-conditions-of-use)), and the Content Limitations (located at [https://www.talkwalker.com/content-limitations](https://www.talkwalker.com/content-limitations)), and all applicable laws or regulations. Company and authorized users shall not sell, resell, re-publish, or distribute the Generated Reports and/or Services without Talkwalker’s prior express written consent. Company must not breach any Third-Party Platform’s terms of use. In particular, Company agrees to: (i) X (formerly Twitter)’s Terms of Service located at [http://twitter.com/tos](http://twitter.com/tos), X’s privacy policy located at [http://twitter.com/privacy](http://twitter.com/privacy), and X’s Rules located at [http://twitter.com/rules](http://twitter.com/rules); (ii) YouTube’s Terms of Service located at [https://www.youtube.com/t/terms](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms); and (iii) Meta’s Terms of Service at [https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms), Meta’s Data Policy at [https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation), and Meta’s Platform Policy at [https://developers.facebook.com/terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms).

Company shall not use the Services as a law enforcement tool or for the tracking of individuals, discrimination of any sort, disciplinary purposes, etc. Further details are provided in the Basic Conditions of Use and Content Limitations.

**4.2.** **Professional Services.** If your Order Form includes professional services (such as SCR Services customized analyses, account set-up, provisioning, or training) (“Talkwalker Professional Services”), the Talkwalker Professional Services Terms contained in a statement of work and attached to such Order Form shall govern those Talkwalker Professional Services.

**4.3.** **Social Content Ratings Services.** If your Order Form includes Social Content Ratings Services and SCR Information (collectively, the “SCR Services”), you acknowledge that the SCR Services are made available to Company for its confidential internal use within the Licensed Geographic Region as identified in the Order Form, except that Company may disclose “Limited Excerpts'' (meaning SCR Information that is not of sufficient quantity or quality as to have independent commercial value, as determined by Talkwalker in its sole discretion) to advertisers, advertising agencies, media buyers, and external communications having a legitimate business interest in the SCR Information as part of Company’s advertising and sales efforts; provided, however, that any disclosure must be accurately sourced to Talkwalker, not claim Talkwalker as the source of any independently generated information, and not be presented in a misleading manner. The data and information included in Services are referred to as “SCR Information”. Company agrees (i) that the SCR Services are the confidential and proprietary information of Talkwalker, and (ii) to treat the SCR Services provided hereunder and this Agreement as confidential information and not disclose such confidential information, other than as provided in this Agreement, without Talkwalker’s prior written consent. Company may not provide SCR Information to third parties (including X and Meta content) via API, bulk download, export features, or other transferable means.

For the sake of clarity and for illustrative purposes, the following displays are not allowed: a display in a visitor’s lobby, airport, trade show, etc. In the event Company wishes to display the Services on a Public Screen, Company must inform Talkwalker and Talkwalker will liaise with X and/or other Third-Party Platforms to seek approval for such Public Screen.

While the quotation of the Third-Party Content accessed to through the use of the Services and included in the reports shall be for Customer’s internal business use only which excludes the right to publicly display, republish or broadcast or else, During the Term, Talkwalker grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without a right to sublicense, to use the Talkwalker Metrics and Company will be free to reproduce, adapt, or otherwise use on any media or materials, so long as Third-Party Content does not appear on those extracts in such display. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company acknowledges that the Generated Reports cannot be used for training, in combination with, or as an input to any artificial intelligence or large language model developed by Company or any third party.

**5.2.** **Feedback.** Company further grants Talkwalker a fully paid-up, worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual (surviving termination or expiry of this Agreement), irrevocable, sublicensable to Talkwalker’s affiliates, and royalty-free license to use and incorporate into the Services any correction, improvement request, recommendation, suggestion, or other feedback provided by Company.

**5.3.** **Company Data.** Company shall own all right, title and interest in and to all of the Company Data and shall have sole responsibility for the legality of such Company Data.

###### **6\. Term and Termination.  
**

**6.1.** **Term of Agreement.** This Agreement will commence on the first day of the initial term set forth on your first Order Form and will continue in effect until the earlier of: (a) the expiration of all Order Forms applicable to you (including any renewal periods unless notice of non-renewal is provided as set out in Section 6.2); or (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (the “Term”).

**6.2.** **Term of Order Form.** The term of each Order Form will start on the first day of the initial term specified on the Order Form, and will continue for the specified term. Except as expressly stated otherwise in an Order Form, all Order Forms will automatically renew for subsequent one-year renewal periods unless a party gives the other party written notice of non-renewal to the other party (if to Company: the e-mail address as set forth in the Order Form; if to Talkwalker: [csm@talkwalker.com](mailto:csm@talkwalker.com) with a copy to [legal@talkwalker.com](mailto:legal@talkwalker.com) (each a “Non-Renewal Notice”)) at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Talkwalker reserves the right to increase the Fees for Services and/or Partner Services on renewal by giving you written notice thereof (which notice may be given by email) provided that if Talkwalker gives you such notice less than ninety (90) days prior to the end of then-current Term, you will have thirty (30) days thereafter to give us a Non-Renewal Notice.

**6.3.** **Termination.** A party may terminate this Agreement for cause (a) immediately if the other party has failed to cure a material breach within thirty (30) days (the “Cure Period”) of receiving written notice of that material breach from the other party; or (b) immediately if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or assignment for the benefit of creditors. Where the Company is the party in breach, during the Cure Period, Talkwalker reserves the right to suspend access to the Services. Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, Talkwalker may immediately suspend access and/or terminate an Order Form and/or this Agreement in its entirety under the following circumstances: (i) in the event of a change in the business, legal, or regulatory environment; (ii) in the event of an adverse judgment, administrative or court order, regulation, or similar, in which case Talkwalker will notify Company immediately of the effective date at which time the Services will be stopped; or (iii) in the event of an actual or potential reputational damage to Talkwalker.

**6.4.** **Effects of Termination.** Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all Order Forms will automatically terminate; (b) your access to Talkwalker accounts, Services and Partner Services will be terminated and you will immediately cease all use thereof; and (c) you will pay all unpaid amounts you owe to Talkwalker. If you terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.3, Talkwalker will refund any Fees you paid in advance for the Services and Partner Services applicable to the period after termination. If Talkwalker terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.3(a) and (b), then you will pay any unpaid Fees for the remainder of the term of each Order Form. In no event will termination of this Agreement relieve you of your obligation to pay any amounts payable to Talkwalker for the period prior to the date of termination.

**6.5.** **Survival.** Any provision of this Agreement that, either by its terms or to give effect to its meaning, must survive and such other provisions that expressly or by their nature are intended to survive termination will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Sections 5, 8, and 9 will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

###### **7\. Fees and Payment.  
**

**7.1.** **Fees.** You will pay all fees as and when described in the Order Form(s) (the “Fees”).

**7.2.** **Invoicing.** We will invoice you for the Fees in the currency set forth on the applicable Order Form. All undisputed invoices are payable by the “Due Date” as defined in the Order Form. Any disputed amounts will not affect payment of non-disputed amounts. You will make payments to the entity and address set forth in the invoice.

**7.3.** **Late Payment.** If any undisputed amounts invoiced are not received by Talkwalker by the due date, then, at our discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the lower of: (a) the rate of 12% per year (1% per month per annum); or (b) the maximum rate permitted by law from the date such payment was due until the date paid. In addition, upon fifteen (15) days’ written notice to you provided after the due date of any undisputed amount, we may suspend your access to the Services if we have not received the amounts invoiced in full.

**7.4.** **Taxes.** You are responsible for paying all taxes, assessments, charges, fees, and levies that may be levied on or applicable to the sale or license of goods or services, as the case may be, including all sales, use, goods and services, value added, and excise taxes, customs duties, and assessments, together with any installments and any interest, fines, and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any governmental authority, including federal, state, provincial, municipal, and foreign governmental authorities (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your subscription to the Services, which for clarity does not include any taxes based on Talkwalker’s income. If we have the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this Section 7.4, the appropriate amount will be invoiced to and paid by you, unless you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this Agreement will be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If you are required to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then the sum payable will be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings, we receive an amount equal to the sum we would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

###### **8\. Confidentiality, Security & Data Protection**

**8.1.** **Confidential Information.** Talkwalker and Company may exchange confidential information (“Confidential Information”) in the course of your negotiation and use of the Services. Talkwalker’s Confidential Information may include, but is not limited to, non-public information about our pricing, personnel, or partnerships, our product roadmap, our security and data protection documentation, or other non-public information we identify as confidential. Company’s Confidential Information includes non-public information about your policies, personnel (including names and email addresses of your Authorized Users), or plans or strategies (such as marketing plans or social strategies you share with Talkwalker in the course of our delivery of Talkwalker Professional Services), and includes Company Data but does not include any other Content published, communicated, or transmitted to or through a Third-Party Platform. When either you or we (the “recipient”) receive Confidential Information from the other (the “discloser”), the recipient will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information of like kind (but in no event less than reasonable care) and will not disclose or use any Confidential Information of the discloser for any purpose outside of the scope of this Agreement. Information will not be considered Confidential Information if (a) it was lawfully in the recipient's possession before receiving it from the discloser; (b) it is provided in good faith to the recipient by a third party without breaching any rights of the discloser or any other party; (ci) it is or becomes generally available to, or accessible by, the public through no fault of the recipient; or (d) it was or is independently developed by the recipient without reference to the discloser’s Confidential Information. In the event that the recipient or any representative of the recipient becomes legally compelled (by law, rule, regulation, subpoena, or similar court process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the recipient will (if permitted to do so) provide the discloser with notice of such circumstances and will limit such disclosure to the required disclosure.

**8.2.** **Security Standards.** During the Term, Talkalker will maintain the “**Security Standards**” described below:

(a). Security Practices. Talkwalker will implement and maintain security practices as described at [https://www.talkwalker.com/security-practices](https://www.talkwalker.com/security-practices).

(c). Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity. Talkwalker has and will maintain a disaster recovery and business continuity plan.

(d). Breach Notification.

**8.3.** **Privacy & Data Protection.** Company acknowledges Talkwalker may process personal data concerning its employees or points of contact for the purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with its Privacy Policy ([https://www.hootsuite.com/legal/privacy](https://www.hootsuite.com/legal/privacy)). With the exception of SCR Services, which are hosted with Amazon Web Services in the United States, the Services are hosted on data centers located in the European Union. Both Parties acknowledge and agree to be bound by the Data Processing Addendum, as available at [https://www.talkwalker.com/resource/legal/privacy-addendum.pdf](https://www.talkwalker.com/resource/legal/privacy-addendum.pdf).

(e) Company’s use of the Services and/or the Generated Reports in non-compliance with this Agreement and/or in violation of applicable law and/or regulation; and

(f) the use of the Services and/or the Generated Reports by Company after notice to Company of the alleged or actual infringement from Talkwalker or any appropriate authority.

If a Claim appears likely or in the event of any actual Claim of infringement, Talkwalker, in its sole discretion, may:

(i) modify the Services;

(ii) procure the necessary rights for Company to continue using the Services; or

(iii) replace the Services or a portion thereof with a functional equivalent.

If Talkwalker determines that none of these options are reasonably practical, Talkwalker may without further formality, terminate the Services or a portion thereof. In case of termination, Talkwalker will refund Company any remaining prorated portion of the prepaid fees. Without limiting this Section 9.4, in the event of any actual or alleged claim of infringement, Talkwalker reserves the right to: (x) discontinue Company’s use of the Services and/or the Generated Reports, (y) block access to the Services and/or the Generated Reports (including blocking access to the Talkwalker Platform), and/or (z) make inaccessible or delete all or part of the data that Company entered into the Services or that have been added to Talkwalker’ systems as a result of Company’s use of the Services.  
  
This Section 9.4 sets forth Talkwalker’s sole liability (and Company’s sole remedy) regarding infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights.

**9.5.** **Indemnification by Company.** Subject to Talkwalker’s compliance with Section 9.6, Company will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Talkwalker, its Affiliates, and its or their directors, officers, employees, agents, shareholders, successors and assigns from and against all claims, losses, damages, penalties, liability, and costs, including reasonable legal fees, of any kind or nature that are incurred in connection with or arising out of a third-party claim: (a) alleging that Talkwalker’s use of Company Data in accordance with this Agreement infringes or violates the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or any other rights of a third party or violates any applicable law; or (b) arising from Company’s use of the Services, Third-Party Content, and/or Third-Party Platforms to which the Services provide access, in breach of Section 4.1 of this Agreement, or breach of any applicable law.

**9.6.** **Indemnification Procedure.** The indemnified party will: (a) give written notice of the claim to the indemnifying party promptly and in any event no later than ten (10) days after the indemnified party receives the claim; (b) give the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (provided that the indemnifying party may not enter into any settlement, compromise or consent to judgment with respect to any claim without the indemnified party’s prior written consent unless such settlement, compromise or consent to judgment unconditionally releases the indemnified party of all liability); and (c) provide the indemnifying party with reasonable cooperation and assistance at the indemnifying party’s expense.

**LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY**

**9.7.** **MAXIMUM LIABILITY.** EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 9.7 THROUGH 9.9, AND NOT INCLUDING COMPANY’S OBLIGATION TO PAY ALL FEES OWED TO TALKWALKER HEREUNDER, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ALL CLAIMS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BY STATUTE, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY COMPANY FOR THE SERVICES SUBJECT TO THE CLAIM DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. FOR CLARITY, THE CALCULATION OF EACH PARTY’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS SECTION 9.7 EXCLUDES ANY FEES PAID BY COMPANY TO A THIRD PARTY OR FOR ANY PARTNER SERVICES, EVEN WHERE TALKWLAKER’S SERVICES ARE BUNDLED WITH OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH PARTNER SERVICES.

**9.8.** **EXCLUDED DAMAGES.**  
  
(a) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY, ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT.  
  
(b) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TALKWALKER BE LIABLE IN THE EVENT A THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM RESTRICTS, EITHER TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY, ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY CONTENT. FURTHER TALKWALKER SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACT OR OMISSION MADE BY COMPANY BASED ON THE GENERATED REPORTS OR THE SERVICES IN GENERAL.  
  
(c) COMPANY IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING, SUBSCRIBING, INSTALLING, MAINTAINING, AND OPERATING ALL ADEQUATE SOFTWARE (SUCH AS A BROWSER), HARDWARE, COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, OR OTHERWISE NECESSARY TO USE THE SERVICES AND/OR THE GENERATED REPORTS. TALKWALKER MAY NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DEFECTS OR DELAYS IN THE SERVICES AND/OR THE GENERATED REPORTS ARISING AS A RESULT OF ANY PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERNET NETWORK.

(d) YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF ACCESS OR TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SERVICES ARE SET FORTH IN THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT.

**9.9.** **Exclusions.** NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO EXCLUDE OR RESTRICT OR WILL BE CONSTRUED AS EXCLUDING OR RESTRICTING THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR (I) INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT; (II) DEATH OR BODILY INJURY CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THAT PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES, OR ITS AGENTS; (III) FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THAT PARTY OR ITS EMPLOYEES; OR (IV) ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE LIMITED OR EXCLUDED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

**9.10.** **Basis of Bargain.** THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF SECTIONS 9.7 THROUGH 9.9 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES CHARGED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF TALKWALKER WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY. THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS.

**10\. General  
**

**10.1.** **Assignment.** Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld), and any attempted assignment without such consent will be void.

It is important for you to review this Agreement before using the Services and from time to time, though we will notify you of any changes that, in our sole discretion, materially impact this Agreement. The updated Agreement will be effective as of the time of posting, or on such later date as may be specified in the updated Agreement, and your continued use of the Services after any such changes are effective will constitute your consent to such changes. Except for changes made by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of this Agreement will be effective unless set forth: (a) in an Order Form issued by Talkwalker and signed by Company; or (b) in an agreement signed or otherwise agreed in writing by both Company and Talkwalker.

Company shall notify Talkwalker immediately in the event of a change in contact details by providing the updated information to: [contact@talkwalker.com](mailto:contact@talkwalker.com).

**10.8.** **Notices to Talkwalker.** All notices, demands, and requests will be deemed given when sent by e-mail to the Parties’ e-mail addresses (for Talkwalker: csm@talkwalker.com, with a copy to legal@talkwalker.com) unless otherwise stated.

**10.9.** **Waivers.** The rights of each Party may be waived only in writing. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right or remedy under this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of that right or remedy. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of that provision or of any similar provision.

**10.10.** **Remedies.** Unless otherwise stated, each party’s remedies under this Agreement are not exclusive of any other remedies under this Agreement, at law or otherwise.
