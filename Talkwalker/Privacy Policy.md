If you publish information on publicly available social media and websites, please refer to our [Author Privacy Policy](https://www.talkwalker.com/author-privacy-policy).
* Talkwalker reviews this Privacy Policy regularly and may revise it, in whole or in part, at any time to adapt to changes in legal requirements or the manner in which we process data. Such changes will be published on our website and will take effect immediately.
