5.4          Minor changes may, from time to time, be made to certain Paid Content, for example, to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, or to address technical or security issues.  These changes will not alter the main characteristics of the Paid Content and should not normally affect your use of that Paid Content.  However, if any change is made that would affect your use of the Paid Content, suitable information will be provided to you.

8.5          We may suspend provision of the Paid Content if We do not receive payment on time from you.  We will inform you of the non-payment on the due date, however if you do not make payment within thirty days of Our notice, We may suspend provision of the Paid Content until We have received all outstanding sums due from you.  If We do suspend provision of the Paid Content, We will inform you of the suspension.  You will not be charged for any Paid Content while provision is suspended.

9.1          When you purchase Paid Content, We will grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to access and use the relevant Paid Content for personal, non-commercial purposes.  The licence granted to you does not give you any rights in Our Paid Content (including any material that We may licence from third parties).

**10.             Problems with the Paid Content**  
  
10.1          By law, We must provide digital content that is of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described.  If any Paid Content does not comply, please contact Us as soon as reasonably possible to inform Us of the problem.  Your available remedies will be as follows:  
  
10.1.1      If the Paid Content has faults, you will be entitled to a repair or a replacement.  
  
10.1.2      If We cannot fix the problem, or if it has not been (or cannot be) fixed within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to you, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund.  
  
10.1.3      If you can demonstrate that the fault has damaged your device or other digital content belonging to you because We have not used reasonable care and skill, you may be entitled to a repair or compensation.  Please refer to sub-Clause 13.3 for more information.  
  
10.2          Please note that We will not be liable under this Clause 10 if We informed you of the fault(s) or other problems with particular Paid Content before you accessed it and it is that same issue that has now caused the problem (for example, if the Paid Content in question is an alpha or beta version and We have warned you that it may contain faults that could harm your device or other digital content); if you have purchased the Paid Content for an unsuitable purpose that is neither obvious nor made known to Us and the problem has resulted from your use of the Paid Content for that purpose; or if the problem is the result of misuse or intentional or careless damage.\]

**11.             Cancelling Your Order**  
  
11.1          If you are a consumer in the European Union, by default you have a legal right to a “cooling-off” period within which you can cancel the Contract for any reason, including if you have changed your mind, and receive a refund.  The period begins once We have sent you your Confirmation (i.e. when the Contract between you and Us is formed) and ends when you access (e.g. download or stream) the Paid Content, or 14 calendar days after the date of Our Confirmation, whichever occurs first.  
  
11.2          After the cooling-off period, you may cancel your Paid Content at any time, however subject to sub-Clause 11.3 and Clause 12, We cannot offer any refunds.

12.2          Our Paid Content is intended for non-commercial use only.  We make no warranty or representation that the Paid Content is fit for commercial, business or industrial use of any kind.  We will not be liable to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, interruption to business, or for any loss of business opportunity.  
  
12.3          If, as a result of Our failure to exercise reasonable care and skill, any digital content (including but not limited to Paid Content) from Our Site damages your device or other digital content belonging to you, We will either repair the damage or pay you appropriate compensation.  Please note that We will not be liable under this provision if:  
  
12.3.1      We have informed you of the problem and provided a free update designed to fix it, but you have not applied the update; or
