Google may also transfer the information to a third party when required to do so by law, or when a third party processes the information for Google.  Browsing this site constitutes your consent to collection of data by Google in the manner and for the uses listed above.

You may withdraw your consent and stop receiving such communications at any time, by clicking on the unsubscribe link that appears in each such email communication from us or by sending an e-mail to the site manager at [webmaster@yadvashem.org.il](mailto:webmaster@yadvashem.org.il).

### Data Protection of Minors

Yad Vashem safeguards the privacy of children and does not deliberately collect any personal information related to children.  Minors under the age of 18 are requested not to share personal information; however, if they wish to do so, they should obtain the consent of a parent or guardian before sending and/or sharing any personal information with the Site.  In the event that Yad Vashem has reasonable grounds to believe that parental consent has not been given, Yad Vashem will be entitled to refuse provision of any of its Services, at its sole discretion.

### Legal Basis for Processing

Yad Vashem will only collect, process and share personal information in accordance with the law and if there is a legal basis to do so, including for the purpose of fulfilling a contract (i.e., to provide services), furthering a legitimate interest of the organization and/or complying with a legal requirement. Where there is no other valid legal basis to collect, process and/or share personal information, we may collect your personal information only with your consent.  You may withdraw your consent at any time by written notice by e-mail. For the avoidance of doubt, withdrawal of your consent will not affect our right to continue to process personal information which you consented to prior to the withdrawal and/or other data processing that is being done on other lawful grounds.

### Retention of Information

Any personal information collected is retained by Yad Vashem in its databases. Personal information is stored in Israel or elsewhere subject to the Regulations of Protection of Privacy (Transfer of Information to Databases Outside the Boundaries of the State of Israel), 5761-2001, and any other applicable law, and in particular local data protection laws of the locality of the database.

Yad Vashem keeps your personal information for as long as necessary in order to fulfill the objectives set forth in this Privacy Policy or for a longer period if so required at its sole discretion. Yad Vashem reviews this periodically, in order to ensure that your personal information is not kept beyond the time required.

### Sharing Information with a Third Party

Yad Vashem keeps your personal information confidential and does not use your personal information other than for the purposes listed herein. Yad Vashem does not transfer your personal information to third parties, other than as follows:

* Transferring information to donors (for example, personal information of participants in educational activities may be transferred to entities which contributed to the funding of these activities);
* Transferring information to Yad Vashem’s partners, for the purpose of furthering its objectives, including local organizations of Yad Vashem worldwide;

* As required in order to further the objectives of the Holocaust Heroes and Remembrance Law - Yad Vashem 5713-1953 (when providing testimony and/or personal information regarding the Holocaust, it is assumed that all such information is gathered and provided to enable Yad Vashem to perform its legal mandate and for the purpose of publication and sharing with the public, unless indicated otherwise at the time such information is collected/provided);
* As required in accordance with the Regulations for Protection of Privacy (Terms of securing information and its Transfer between Public Entities), 5746-1986.

When your personal information is transferred to third parties, we request these third-party entities to undertake to safeguard your information and to use it solely for the purposes for which it was provided.

In addition, whenever we transfer or share your personal information to third parties in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, we obligate such third parties to take equivalent technical and organizational measures necessary in order to protect your information.
