Each customer processing personal data on behalf of EU/EEA individuals will be able to sign this contract with ConvertKit and keep it on file for their records.

MailerLite and ConvertKit provide a rule in the subscriber filter where we can sort our subscribers by location, to help us easily sort GDPR subscribers. We are aware of the chance that a EU citizen could be living abroad in a non-EU country. In these cases, it is impossible to identify them as EU citizens.
