[#### The Atlas Story

I started Atlas knowing that I wanted to do things differently. To me, the customer experience is not just the initial phone call to set up service, or how easy it is to log in and pay your bill every month. At Atlas, it starts with a no-BS sales process, including transparent published pricing. It means timely and quick installations measured in hours or days for currently serviced buildings . . .](https://gigabit.io/community/about-atlas)
