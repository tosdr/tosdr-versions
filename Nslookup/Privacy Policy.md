    In order to serve the web pages you request, we process — but do not store — your **IP address**.
* **Diagnosing issues**  
    When we encounter an issue while serving the web page that you have requested, we may store the **date, time and query** of that request with our supplier [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). This data is not linked to you, and is retained for 90 days.
* **Logging**
