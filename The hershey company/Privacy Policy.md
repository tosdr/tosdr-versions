Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each once that you use.

--------------------------------------------

We retain your Personal Data as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or allowed under law.

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclose of the Personal Data; the purposes for which we use the Personal Data; whether we can achieve the purposes through other means; and the applicable legal requirements.

If we de-identify data, we will maintain and use the data in de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the data except as required or permitted by law.

9\. How We Protect Your Personal Data
-------------------------------------

We use commercially reasonable security measures, including physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect your Personal Data from loss; misuse; and unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, and deletion.

However, the Internet is not 100% secure. As a result, like all businesses, we cannot guarantee the security of the Personal Data you provide to us via the Website. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords.

10\. Cross-Border Transfers
---------------------------

As a global organization, we will transfer and/or store Personal Data under our control in the United States and/or other countries where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. As a result, your Personal Data may be transferred to other countries or regions.

If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that we may transfer your Personal Data to the United States. When we transfer your Personal Data outside of your country of residence, we do so in accordance with applicable law and take appropriate steps to ensure your data is protected. However, please note that while outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, your Personal Data will be subject to applicable laws (including those in the United States), which may not provide the same level of protections for Personal Data as those in your country of residence.

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Data to countries that have not been recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (or other government-approved contracts) or other lawful data transfer mechanisms that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Data that is transferred to countries that have not been recognized as providing an adequate level of protection.

1\. What are Cookies?
---------------------

“Cookies” are small text files sent from a website and stored on your device.  Cookies are used for various purposes, including to make site navigation more efficient, help remember your preferences, and improve your browsing experience. They can also enable the delivery of relevant and personalized advertisements.

There are different types of cookies, which are distinguishable on the basis of their origin. “**First-party cookies**” are cookies that are stored by the website you are visiting, while “**third-party cookies**” are stored by a domain other than that of the website you are visiting. Cookies can also be distinguished on the basis of their functions and lifespan, as described below.

2. The Types of Cookies We Use and How We Use Them
--------------------------------------------------

| Cookie Type | Purpose of Use |
| --- | --- |

If you delete or reset your cookies or mobile identifiers, change browsers, or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out again. Even if you choose to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, you may still receive advertising, but the advertisements may be less relevant.

Some of our partners may provide you with additional choices with respect to interest-based advertising. For example, certain social media platforms allow you to control your advertising preferences directly through their services. Please review the privacy policies of the third-party services you use for more information.

Depending on your U.S. state residency, our use and disclosure of Personal Data for interest-based advertising purposes constitutes “sharing” or the processing of Personal Data for “targeted advertising” under applicable law.
