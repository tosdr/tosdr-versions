Tools for testing your website
------------------------------

We have been working with websites since [the dawn of the world wide web](https://web.archive.org/web/19970613214556/http://www.sot.com:80/), when there were less than a million [web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) in the whole world. Today there are more than a billion sites, 1000 times more than twenty years ago. Despite the huge growth, the underlying concepts and technologies remain the same. As people use the Internet increasingly with mobile devices and phones, [loading speed and responsive design](#testwebsite "Test your website for speeed and errors") are becoming ever more essential. We have collected the following tools for you to make sure that your website works with mobile devices and ranks well in search engines.

#### Loading speed

If your website is too slow, you lose visitors.

 

#### Mobile-friendliness

Most of us are using mobile phones & devices.

 

#### Errors in html code

Errors create compatibility and usability issues.

 

#### Unique content

Search engines favor unique, high quality text.

 

#### Meta tags

With proper meta tags, you'll attract more traffic.

  

#### Facebook sharing

Websites are often shared in social media.
