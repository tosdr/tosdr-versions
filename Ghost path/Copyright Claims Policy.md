===========

_Last updated: January 13, 2014_

1\. DMCA
--------

Ghost Path adheres to the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), as defined by 17 U.S.C. 512. Our Designated Agent is listed below and is on file with the United States Copyright Office (http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/list/index.html).

2\. Procedure for Filing a DMCA Request
---------------------------------------

To file a copyright infringement notification with Ghost Path, you will need to send a written notification (in the form of an email communication) that includes the following (please consult your legal counsel or see Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to confirm these requirements):

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Your written Notification of Claimed Infringement must be sent to our Designated Copyright Agent at this email address: abuse@ghostpath.com. We will review and address, in the order they are received, all notices that comply with the requirements above. If your notice fails to substantially comply with all of these requirements, we may not be able respond to your notice.

3\. DMCA Counter Notifications
------------------------------

If you believe that a DMCA request has been filed in error then you may send a Counter Notification to our Registered Agent at abuse@ghostpath.com. Your Counter Notification email must include the following information:

1. Identify the specific item to which we have disabled access.
2. Provide your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.
3. Provide a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who the provided notification of claimed infringement to which your notice relates or an agent of such person.
4. Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
5. Your full name will be accepted as your signature.

Once we receive the counter notification we may send a copy to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the subscriber, the removed content may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days.
