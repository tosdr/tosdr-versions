--------------------------------------------------------

As you navigate through and interact with our Services, we may also use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information from your device, browser, or other network activities as described in our Cookie Policy, available at [https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html](https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html).

Website Visit and Device Information. We collect details of your visits to our Websites and use of our Mobile Apps, including, but not limited to, traffic data, geolocation data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Websites. We collect information about your computer, mobile device, and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, browser type, clickstream patterns (i.e., what you click on in a website), the URL of the most recent website you visited before coming to our Websites, the amount of time you spent on our Websites, and the pages you viewed while on our Websites. We may derive a rough estimate of your location from your IP address when you visit our Websites. For users of our Mobile Apps, we may also collect and maintain a history of your precise location information using Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth technologies, as well as your device identifiers and GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude/longitude). If you want to prevent the collection of your location information, please adjust your settings in your mobile device to limit the Mobile App’s access to your location information.

When you use our website, we share information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our identity partners/service providers. These partners return an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online, in-app, and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. To opt out of this use, please click here ([https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/))

Behavioral Tracking. We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services, or associate Personal Information with other information collected in this manner.

Location Analytics: Our Mobile Apps and mobile browser Websites include functionality (e.g., for submission of a driver review of a charging facility) which allows us to identify a driver’s location and the charging facility location at which a user is currently located. We collect information such as IP address, device ID, and geolocation. Mobile App users can choose to use the Mobile Apps anonymously or to login as an identified user, in which case the personal data provided upon registration may be used.

For users of the Mobile Apps, we may ask permission to access certain information from your mobile device, including your contact list, photos and videos, and microphone and camera. It is optional for you to provide us with access to this information. However, certain features of the Mobile Apps may not function optimally if you decide to not provide us with permission. 

Web Beacons. Pages of our Websites and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

Pixel Tracking. In addition to using cookies, the Websites may employ “pixel tracking.” Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our Products, Services, and offers with your interests and needs. For example, if you visit our Websites from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement brought you to the Websites. If you visit our Websites, and we link you to another website, we also may be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third-party website.

GIF. We may use tiny images known as clear GIFs to track behavior of users, including statistics on who opens our emails.

IP Address. Our servers (or those of our service providers) automatically record certain log file information reported from your browser when you access the Websites. These server logs may include information such as which pages of the Websites you visited, your internet protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, and other information on how you interact with the Websites. These log files are generally deleted periodically.

Third-Party Metrics and Analytics. Third-party metrics and analytics, on certain pages or features of the Services to help us understand and analyze visitor traffic, measure the promotional effectiveness and efficacy of our features, offerings, and marketing campaigns. We also use these tools to identify pitfalls, shortcomings, and areas of our operations in need of improvement, and to view the overall performance and ranking of our online presence. These tools might store cookies on your device at their discretion.

2.3 SOCIAL MEDIA PLUGINS
------------------------

We integrate social media application program interfaces or plug-ins (“Plug-ins”) from social networks, including Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest and/or possibly other companies, into the Websites. In order to register as a user with us, you may have the option to sign in using your Facebook or other social media site login.

For example, when you visit our Websites, the plugin creates a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. This allows Facebook to receive information about your visit to our Websites with your IP address. If you click the Facebook “Like” button while you are logged on to your Facebook account, you can link the contents of our Websites to your Facebook profile. This allows Facebook to assign your visit to our Websites to your user account. Please note that as provider of the Websites, we receive no notification about the contents of the transmitted data or their use by Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to assign your visit to our Websites to your Facebook user account, please log out of your Facebook user account.

Plug-ins may transfer information about you to the Plug-in’s respective platform without action by you. This information may include your platform user identification number, which website you are on, and more. Interacting with a Plug-in will transmit information directly to that Plug-in’s social network and that information may be visible by others on that platform. Plug-ins are controlled by the respective social media site’s privacy policy (available on their website), and not by our Privacy Policy.

In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact if we determine in good faith that we are no longer legally prohibited from doing so and that no risk scenarios described in this paragraph apply.

3.6 DISCLOSURE OF DE-IDENTIFIED PERSONAL INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------

We may share De-Identified Personal Information (including, but not limited to, anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, IP address, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with unaffiliated parties in any way we choose and for any purpose, such as for system administration and to monitor usage of the Websites; for measuring the number of visits to our Websites, average time spent, number of pages viewed; and monitoring various other Website statistics to improve the content.

4\.  “DO NOT TRACK” REQUESTS
============================

Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including PlugShare, do not respond to DNT signals.

5\. PLUGSHARE COMMUNICATIONS, PREFERENCES, AND OPTING OUT
=========================================================

You also agree that we may send you notifications of activity regarding our Products, Services, the Websites, the mobile applications, your Personal Information, or any aspect of our relationship, to the email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings.

6\. DEVELOPERS USING PLUGSHARE PLATFORM SERVICES
================================================

We collaborate with and allow third parties to use PlugShare’s developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with PlugShare. These third party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use the PlugShare platform technology or have agreed to our self-service Application Programming Interfaces (“API”) and Plug-In terms in order to build software platform applications (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plug-In terms of use contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the Personal Information you provide to PlugShare. If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third party developer. To revoke permission granted to a Platform Application, please visit your settings. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information about you, just as your connections do.

7\. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
=====================================

The time period for which we retain your Personal Information depends on the purposes for which we use it. We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active, or as long as you are a registered account holder or user of our Services or for as long as we have another business purpose to do so (such as, but not limited to, for business, tax, or legal purposes) and, thereafter, for no longer than is required or permitted by law, or our records retention policy, reasonably necessary for internal reporting and reconciliation purposes, or to provide you with feedback or information you might request. This period of retention is subject to our review and alteration. We may retain De-Identified Personal Information for as long as we deem appropriate.

Following termination or deactivation of your user account, we may retain your profile information and all information posted to public areas of the Websites. Following termination or deactivation of your user account, we may retain your Personal Information and other data, but will maintain it as confidential according to the Terms, this Privacy Policy, and as required by applicable law. We have the right to delete all of your Personal Information and other data after termination of your user account without notice to you.

8\. NO INTENTIONAL COLLECTION OF CHILDREN’S DATA

We do not knowingly collect, solicit, or maintain Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for or use our Services. If you are under 18, please do not send any Personal Information to us. In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information from our database.

9\. WHERE PERSONAL INFORMATION IS PROCESSED AND STORED; APPLICABLE GOVERNING LAW
================================================================================

We have our headquarters in the United States. The Personal Information we or our Service Providers collect may be stored and processed in servers within or outside of the United States and wherever we and our Service Providers have facilities around the globe, and certain information may be accessible by persons or companies outside of the United States who provide services for us. You consent to our and our Service Providers’ transmission and/or transfer of your Personal Information to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

US laws apply insofar as the you are a resident of the United States. Otherwise, this Privacy Policy and all other matters shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the province/state and federal laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside. Jurisdictions outside of your residence may have privacy laws different than those in your including the right of law enforcement and government authorities to access the Personal Information.  To the extent that we process data outside of your country, we undertake a privacy impact assessment to determine that our Service Providers can offer substantially the same level of protection as required in your jurisdiction and enter into contracts to further bolster the obligations to appropriately process your Personal Information.

10\. SECURITY
=============

We have implemented technical and organizational security safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, destruction, alteration and disclosure. However, please keep in mind that the Internet is not a 100% secure environment. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information, be cautious when transmitting any Personal Information through e-mails, instant messaging, and similar means of communication, and maintain good internet security practices.

EXERCISING RIGHTS

To exercise the access, correction, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a request to us by using our webform available [here](https://company.plugshare.com/privacy-notice.html#data-form). Only you or a person you have authorized to act on your behalf may make a request related to your Personal Information. You also may make a request on behalf of your minor child. If we receive a request from a person to exercise right on your behalf, we will ask for a copy of your signed permission giving authorization to submit such requests on your behalf and we will contact you to directly confirm such authorization. You may only make a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable Consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or that an authorized representative has made the request.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

To exercise the rights to opt out of cross-context behavioral advertising, targeted advertising, or the sharing of Personal Information as described above, you will need to opt out based on what platform you are on.  Note that your request to opt out is specific to the device and platform where you submit that request, so you may need to submit multiple requests if you intend to opt out of these specific processing activities for multiple devices and platforms.

Upon verification of your identity we will proceed to process your request and respond within 45 calendar days, unless (a) we are unable to verify your request, (b) if we are unable to match you with information in our database, or (c) if an exception under the law exists exempting us from complying with your request. If we require more time (up to an additional forty-five (45) calendar days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

If we are unable to comply with your request, the response we provide will explain the reasons for this. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable Consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

1.4 INFORMATIONEN, DIE DURCH AUTOMATISIERTE TECHNOLOGIEN ERHOBEN WERDEN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wenn Sie durch unsere Dienste navigieren und mit ihnen interagieren, können wir auch automatische Datenerhebungstechnologien verwenden, um bestimmte Informationen von Ihrem Gerät, Browser oder anderen Netzwerkaktivitäten zu erheben, wie in unserer Cookie-Richtlinie beschrieben, die Sie unter [https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html](https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html) finden.

Website-Besuch und Geräteinformationen. Wir erheben Einzelheiten zu Ihren Besuchen auf unseren Websites und zur Nutzung unserer mobilen Apps, einschließlich, aber nicht beschränkt auf Verkehrsdaten, Geolokalisierungsdaten, Protokolle und andere Kommunikationsdaten sowie die Ressourcen, auf die Sie auf den Websites zugreifen und die Sie auf diesen nutzen. Wir erheben Informationen über Ihren Computer, Ihr Mobilgerät und Ihre Internetverbindung, einschließlich Ihrer IP-Adresse, Ihres Betriebssystems, Ihres Browsertyps, Ihrer Clickstream-Muster (d. h., worauf Sie auf einer Website klicken), der URL der neuesten Website, die Sie besucht haben, bevor Sie zu unseren Websites gekommen sind, der Zeit, die Sie auf unseren Websites verbracht haben, und der Seiten, die Sie auf unseren Websites angesehen haben. Wir können eine grobe Schätzung Ihres Standorts von Ihrer IP-Adresse ableiten, wenn Sie unsere Websites besuchen. Für Benutzer unserer mobilen Apps können wir auch eine Historie Ihrer genauen Standortinformationen mithilfe von WLAN- und/oder Bluetooth-Technologien sowie Ihrer Gerätekennungen und GPS-Koordinaten (z. B. Breitengrad/Längengrad) erhobenen und pflegen. Wenn Sie die Erhebung Ihrer Standortinformationen verhindern möchten, passen Sie bitte Ihre Einstellungen auf Ihrem Mobilgerät an, um den Zugriff der mobilen App auf Ihre Standortinformationen zu beschränken.

Wenn Sie unsere Website nutzen, geben wir Informationen, die wir von Ihnen sammeln, wie Ihre E-Mail-Adresse (in gehashter Form), Ihre IP-Adresse oder Informationen über Ihren Browser oder Ihr Betriebssystem, an unsere Identitätspartner/Dienstleister weiter. Diese Partner geben einen Online-Identifikationscode zurück, den wir möglicherweise in unserem Erstanbieter-Cookie für unsere Verwendung in Online-, In-App- und Cross-Channel-Werbung speichern und der möglicherweise an Werbeunternehmen weitergegeben wird, um interessenbasierte und zielgerichtete Werbung zu ermöglichen. Um diese Nutzung zu deaktivieren, klicken Sie bitte hier ([https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/)).

Verhaltenstracking. Wir können diese Technologien auch verwenden, um Informationen über Ihre Online-Aktivitäten im Laufe der Zeit und über Websites Dritter oder andere Online-Dienste hinweg zu erheben oder personenbezogene Daten mit anderen auf diese Weise erhobenen Informationen zu verknüpfen.

Standortanalyse: Unsere mobilen Apps und mobilen Browser-Websites beinhalten Funktionen (z. B. zur Einreichung einer Fahrerbewertung einer Ladeeinrichtung), die es uns ermöglichen, den Standort eines Fahrers und den Standort der Ladeeinrichtung zu identifizieren, an dem sich ein Benutzer derzeit befindet. Wir erheben Informationen wie IP-Adresse, Geräte-ID und Geostandort. Benutzer der mobilen App können die mobilen Apps anonym nutzen oder sich als identifizierter Benutzer anmelden. In diesem Fall können die bei der Registrierung bereitgestellten personenbezogenen Daten verwendet werden.

Für Benutzer der mobilen Apps können wir um Erlaubnis bitten, auf bestimmte Informationen von Ihrem mobilen Gerät zuzugreifen, einschließlich Ihrer Kontaktliste, Fotos und Videos sowie Mikrofon und Kamera. Es ist Ihnen freigestellt, uns Zugang zu diesen Informationen zu gewähren. Es kann jedoch sein, dass bestimmte Funktionen der mobilen Apps nicht optimal funktionieren, wenn Sie uns keine Erlaubnis erteilen. 

Web-Beacons. Die Seiten unserer Websites und unsere E-Mails können kleine elektronische Dateien enthalten, die als Web-Beacons (auch als Clear Gifs, Pixel-Tags und Single-Pixel-Gifs bezeichnet) bekannt sind und die es uns beispielsweise ermöglichen, die Benutzer zu zählen, die diese Seiten besucht oder eine E-Mail geöffnet haben, sowie andere damit zusammenhängende Website-Statistiken zu erstellen (z. B. Aufzeichnung der Beliebtheit bestimmter Website-Inhalte und Überprüfung der System- und Serverintegrität).

Pixel-Tracking. Zusätzlich zur Verwendung von Cookies können die Websites „Pixel-Tracking“ verwenden. Pixel-Tracking umfasst die Verwendung von Pixel-Tags, die für den Benutzer nicht sichtbar sind und aus einigen Zeilen Computercode bestehen. Pixel-Tracking misst die Effektivität von Werbeanzeigen und stellt aggregierte und spezifische Nutzungsstatistiken zusammen. Wir können auf diese Pixel-Tags zugreifen, um Aktivitäten und Interessen zu identifizieren, die es uns ermöglichen, unsere Produkte, Dienste und Angebote besser auf Ihre Interessen und Bedürfnisse abzustimmen. Wenn Sie beispielsweise unsere Websites von einer Werbung auf einer anderen Website besuchen, ermöglicht das Pixel-Tag dem Werbetreibenden, zu verfolgen, dass seine Werbung Sie zu den Websites geführt hat. Wenn Sie unsere Websites besuchen und wir Sie mit einer anderen Website verlinken, können wir möglicherweise auch feststellen, dass Sie auf eine Website eines Drittanbieters gesendet wurden und/oder mit ihr Geschäfte getätigt haben.

GIF. Wir können winzige Bilder verwenden, die als Clear-Gifs bekannt sind, um das Verhalten von Benutzern zu verfolgen, einschließlich Statistiken darüber, wer unsere E-Mails öffnet.

IP-Adresse. Unsere Server (oder die unserer Dienstanbieter) erheben automatisch bestimmte Protokolldateiinformationen, die von Ihrem Browser gemeldet werden, wenn Sie auf die Websites zugreifen. Diese Serverprotokolle können Informationen enthalten, wie z. B. welche Seiten der Websites Sie besucht haben, Ihre Internetprotokolladresse („IP“), Ihren Browsertyp und andere Informationen darüber, wie Sie mit den Websites interagieren. Diese Protokolldateien werden in der Regel regelmäßig gelöscht.

Metriken und Analysen von Drittanbietern. Metriken und Analysen von Drittanbietern auf bestimmten Seiten oder Funktionen der Dienste, um uns dabei zu helfen, den Besucherverkehr zu verstehen und zu analysieren sowie die Werbewirksamkeit und Effektivität unserer Funktionen, Angebote und Marketingkampagnen zu messen. Wir nutzen diese Tools auch, um Fallstricke, Mängel und verbesserungsbedürftige Bereiche unseres Betriebs zu identifizieren und um die Gesamtleistung und das Ranking unserer Online-Präsenz zu überprüfen. Diese Tools können Cookies nach eigenem Ermessen auf Ihrem Gerät speichern.

COOKIE-HINWEIS UND RICHTLINIE

Die Technologien, die wir für die automatische Datenerhebung verwenden, umfassen auch Cookies, wie unten beschrieben.

So können wir beispielsweise Ihren geografischen Standort in einem Cookie speichern, sodass die Websites angezeigt werden, die Ihrem Gebiet entsprechen. Wir können uns auch an Ihre Präferenzen erinnern, wie z. B. die Textgröße, Schriftart und andere anpassbare Aspekte der Websites. Funktions-Cookies können auch in der Lage sein, die Produkte oder Videos zu verfolgen, die konsultiert wurden, um Wiederholungen zu vermeiden. Die durch diese Cookies erheben Informationen können nicht verwendet werden, um Sie zu identifizieren, und können Ihre Browseraktivitäten auf Websites, die nicht zu uns gehören, nicht überwachen. Funktions-Cookies ermöglichen es uns, Werbung anzuzeigen, die auf Sie auf unseren Websites zugeschnitten ist, um zu verstehen, welche Teile unserer Inhalte Sie am meisten interessieren und welche Produkt- oder Dienstkategorien Sie anfordern. Einige unserer Dienstleister dürfen Cookies auf unseren Websites platzieren. Diese Unternehmen können Ihnen auch die Möglichkeit geben, die Verwendung von Cookies in Zukunft zu verhindern.

Sie können die zukünftige Verwendung bestimmter Cookies jederzeit verhindern oder ablehnen, indem Sie die entsprechende Einstellung in Ihrem Browser aktivieren, um die Annahme von Browser-Cookies zu verweigern. Wenn Sie dies jedoch tun, kann Ihre Erfahrung auf unseren Websites beeinträchtigt werden; z. B. können Sie möglicherweise nicht auf bestimmte Teile unserer Websites zugreifen.

2.1 AUTOMATISIERTE ENTSCHEIDUNGSFINDUNG
---------------------------------------

Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen und die wir aus anderen Quellen erhalten, verwenden, um Ihre Interessen besser zu verstehen, damit wir versuchen können, vorherzusagen, an welchen anderen Produkten, Dienste und Informationen Sie am meisten interessiert sind. Bei dieser Praxis werden auf der Grundlage dieser Informationen automatisierte Entscheidungen über Sie getroffen, damit wir unsere Interaktionen mit Ihnen besser auf Sie zuschneiden können, um sie relevanter und interessanter zu gestalten. Sie können dem jederzeit widersprechen oder uns um weitere Informationen über die Methodik unserer automatisierten Entscheidungsprozesse bitten, indem Sie uns kontaktieren (siehe Abschnitt 12 unten).

2.2 TEXTNACHRICHTEN
-------------------

Unsere Dienste können das Senden von Nachrichten an Sie mit dem Short Message Service („SMS“) umfassen, die bis zu zwei Nachrichten pro Tag an Ihr drahtloses Gerät senden können (es sei denn, dass Sie weiter mit uns kommunizieren), aber die Nachrichtenhäufigkeit kann variieren. Wenn Sie ausdrücklich darin einwilligen, Textnachrichten von uns zu erhalten und eine Mobiltelefonnummer anzugeben, willigen Sie ein zu, wiederkehrende Informations- und Transaktionstexte von oder im Namen von uns an die von Ihnen angegebene Nummer zu erhalten.

Wir integrieren Social-Media-Anwendungsprogrammschnittstellen oder Plug-ins („Plug-ins“) aus sozialen Netzwerken, einschließlich Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest und/oder möglicherweise anderen Unternehmen, in die Websites. Um sich bei uns als Benutzer zu registrieren, haben Sie möglicherweise die Möglichkeit, sich mit Ihrer Anmeldedaten für Facebook oder anderen Social-Media-Websites anzumelden.

Wenn Sie beispielsweise unsere Websites besuchen, stellt das Plug-in eine direkte Verbindung zwischen Ihrem Browser und dem Facebook-Server her. Facebook erhält damit Informationen über Ihren Besuch auf unseren Websites mit Ihrer IP-Adresse. Wenn Sie auf der Benutzeroberfläche von Facebook „Gefällt mir“ klicken, während Sie bei Ihrem Facebook-Konto angemeldet sind, können Sie die Inhalte unserer Websites mit Ihrem Facebook-Profil verknüpfen. Dadurch kann Facebook Ihren Besuch auf unseren Websites Ihrem Benutzerkonto zuweisen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir als Anbieter der Websites keine Benachrichtigung über den Inhalt der übermittelten Daten oder deren Nutzung durch Facebook erhalten. Wenn Sie nicht möchten, dass Facebook Ihren Besuch auf unseren Websites Ihrem Facebook-Benutzerkonto zuweist, melden Sie sich bitte von Ihrem Facebook-Benutzerkonto ab.

Wenn Sie sich über ein Social-Media-Plug-in anmelden, Sie autorisieren uns, auf bestimmte Kontoinformationen von dieser Social-Media-Website zuzugreifen, wie z. B.

Wir können keine Zusicherungen in Bezug auf die Verwendung oder Übermittlung von übermittelten Informationen machen, die uns im Falle eines Konkurses, einer Reorganisation, einer Insolvenz, eines Konkursverwalters oder einer Abtretung zugunsten von Gläubigern zur Verfügung stehen könnten. Darüber hinaus sind wir, außer wie gesetzlich vorgeschrieben, nicht verantwortlich für Sicherheitsverletzungen durch nicht verbundene Parteien oder für Handlungen von nicht verbundenen Parteien, die die übermittelten Informationen erhalten, die uns offengelegt werden.

3.5 ERFORDERLICHE OFFENLEGUNGEN; SCHUTZ DER RECHTE; SICHERHEIT
--------------------------------------------------------------

Sofern in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie nicht anders beschrieben, werden wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht an nicht verbundene Parteien weitergeben, es sei denn, dass wir gesetzlich sind, per Gerichtsbeschluss oder gerichtlichem Verfahren (z. B. Vorladung) dazu verpflichtet, insbesondere zur Beantwortung von Anfragen von Regierungen, Aufsichtsbehörden oder Lizenzgebern, oder wenn wir glauben, dass eine solche Maßnahme notwendig ist: (a) zur Einhaltung von Gesetzen, zur Befolgung von rechtlichen Verfahren, die uns oder unseren verbundenen Unternehmen, Tochtergesellschaften, Vertragshändlern oder Affinity-Partnern zugestellt werden, oder zur Untersuchung, Verhinderung oder Ergreifung von Maßnahmen in Bezug auf mutmaßliche oder tatsächliche illegale Aktivitäten; (b) zur Durchsetzung unserer Bedingungen oder Kundenvereinbarungen (einschließlich zu Abrechnungs- und Inkassozwecken); (c) um Vorkehrungen gegen Haftungsansprüche zu treffen; (d) zur Untersuchung und Abwehr von Ansprüchen oder Behauptungen Dritter; (e) zur Unterstützung staatlicher Vollzugsbehörden oder zur Erfüllung nationaler oder anderer staatlicher Sicherheitsanforderungen; (f) zum Schutz der Sicherheit oder Integrität unserer Websites, unserer Dienste und mobilen Anwendungen oder (g) zur Ausübung oder zum Schutz der Rechte, des Eigentums oder der persönlichen Sicherheit von uns, unseren Benutzern oder anderen. 

Wir werden versuchen, Sie nach Möglichkeit über diese Anfragen zu informieren, es sei denn, dass: (i) die Benachrichtigung durch das Gerichtsverfahren, durch eine gerichtliche Anordnung, die wir erhalten, oder durch geltendes Recht untersagt ist, oder (ii) wir der Ansicht sind, dass die Benachrichtigung aussichtslos oder ineffektiv wäre, das Risiko einer Verletzung oder eines körperlichen oder sonstigen Schadens für eine Person oder eine Gruppe bedeuten würde oder das Risiko eines Betrugs gegen uns, unsere Nutzer, unsere Websites, Dienste oder mobilen Anwendungen schaffen oder erhöhen würde. In Fällen, in denen wir rechtlichen Anfragen aus diesen Gründen ohne Vorankündigung nachkommen, werden wir versuchen, diesen Benutzer nachträglich über die Anfrage zu informieren, wenn wir in gutem Glauben feststellen, dass wir dies nicht mehr gesetzlich verboten sind und dass keine in diesem Absatz beschriebenen Risikoszenarien gelten.

3.6 OFFENLEGUNG ANONYMISIERTER PERSONENBEZOGENER DATEN
------------------------------------------------------

Wir können anonymisierte personenbezogene Daten (insbesondere anonyme Nutzungsdaten, verweisende/Ausgangsseiten und URLs, IP-Adresse, Plattformtypen, Anzahl der Klicks usw.) an nicht verbundene Parteien auf jede von uns gewählte Weise und zu jedem beliebigen Zweck weitergeben, z. B. zur Systemverwaltung und zur Überwachung der Nutzung der Websites; zur Messung der Anzahl der Besuche auf unseren Websites, der durchschnittlichen Zeit, der Anzahl der angesehenen Seiten; und zur Überwachung verschiedener anderer Website-Statistiken zur Verbesserung des Inhalts.

4\.  „DO NOT TRACK“-ANFRAGEN
============================

Einige Webbrowser (einschließlich Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox und Chrome) enthalten eine „Do Not Track“-Funktion („DNT“) oder eine ähnliche Funktion, die Websites signalisiert, dass ein Benutzer seine Online-Aktivitäten und sein Online-Verhalten nicht verfolgen möchte. Wenn eine Website, die auf ein bestimmtes DNT-Signal reagiert, das DNT-Signal empfängt, kann der Browser diese Website daran hindern, bestimmte Informationen über den Benutzer des Browsers zu erheben. Nicht alle Browser bieten eine DNT-Option und DNT-Signale sind noch nicht einheitlich. Aus diesem Grund reagieren viele Website-Betreiber, einschließlich PlugShare, nicht auf DNT-Signale.

5\. PLUGSHARE-KOMMUNIKATION, PRÄFERENZEN UND ABMELDUNG (OPT-OUT)
================================================================

Indem Sie uns Ihre E-Mail-Adresse zur Verfügung stellen, willigen Sie ein, dass wir die E-Mail-Adresse verwenden, um Ihnen dienstbezogene Mitteilungen per E-Mail zu senden, einschließlich, aber nicht beschränkt auf gesetzlich vorgeschriebene Mitteilungen (z. B. Mitteilungen über Datenschutz- oder Sicherheitsvorfälle), anstelle der Kommunikation per Post. Sie erklären sich außerdem damit einverstanden, dass wir Ihnen Benachrichtigungen über Aktivitäten in Bezug auf unsere Produkte, Dienste, die Websites, die mobilen Anwendungen, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten oder jeden Aspekt unserer Beziehung gemäß den geltenden Datenschutzeinstellungen an die von Ihnen angegebene E-Mail-Adresse senden können. Wir können Ihre E-Mail-Adresse verwenden, um Ihnen andere Nachrichten oder Inhalte zu senden, wie z. B. Newsletter, Ergänzungen oder Änderungen an Funktionen des Dienstes oder Sonderangebote. Wenn Sie solche E-Mail-Nachrichten nicht erhalten möchten, können Sie sich abmelden, indem Sie auf Abmelden klicken, sofern verfügbar. Die Abmeldung kann Sie daran hindern, E-Mail-Nachrichten zu Updates, Verbesserungen, besonderen Funktionen, Ankündigungen oder Angeboten zu erhalten. Sie dürfen sich nicht von dienstbezogenen E-Mails abmelden. Wenn Sie sich entschieden haben, uns keine E-Mail-Adresse oder andere Adresse zur Verfügung zu stellen, erhalten Sie möglicherweise keine E-Mails im Zusammenhang mit unserem Service.

Über die Seite mit den Einstellungen Ihres Benutzerkontos können Sie auf bestimmte Informationen, die Sie uns zur Verfügung gestellt haben, wie Name und Passwort, E-Mail-Adresse, Adresse, Benutzerprofilinformationen usw. zugreifen und diese in einigen Fällen bearbeiten oder löschen. Die Informationen, die Sie anzeigen, aktualisieren und löschen können, können sich ändern, wenn sich die Produkte, Websites, Dienste oder unsere Praktiken ändern. Wenn Sie Fragen zur Anzeige oder Aktualisierung von Informationen haben, die wir über Sie gespeichert haben, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte. Wenn Sie jedoch Informationen aktualisieren, können wir eine Kopie der nicht überarbeiteten Informationen in unseren Unterlagen aufbewahren. Sie können die Löschung Ihres Kontos beantragen, indem Sie uns eine E-Mail senden. Es liegt in Ihrer Verantwortung, Ihre aktuelle E-Mail-Adresse bei uns zu pflegen. Je nachdem, in welchem Bundesstaat oder Land Sie wohnen, haben Sie möglicherweise zusätzliche Rechte. Weitere Informationen finden Sie unten.

6\. ENTWICKLER, DIE PLUGSHARE-PLATTFORMDIENSTE NUTZEN
=====================================================

Wir arbeiten mit Dritten zusammen und gestatten Dritten, die Entwicklerplattform von PlugShare zu nutzen, um Dienste und Funktionen in Verbindung mit PlugShare anzubieten. Diese externen Entwickler haben entweder eine Vereinbarung zur Nutzung der PlugShare-Plattformtechnologie ausgehandelt oder haben unseren Self-Service-Application-Programming-Schnittstellen („API“) und Plug-in-Bedingungen zugestimmt, um Softwareplattformanwendungen („Plattformanwendungen“) zu erstellen. Sowohl die ausgehandelten Vereinbarungen als auch unsere API- und Plug-in-Nutzungsbedingungen enthalten Einschränkungen darüber, wie Dritte auf die personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie PlugShare zur Verfügung stellen, zugreifen, diese speichern und verwenden dürfen. Wenn Sie sich für die Nutzung einer Plattformanwendung entscheiden, werden Sie gebeten, die Zustimmung zur Datenschutzrichtlinie und Benutzervereinbarung des Drittanbieters zu bestätigen. Um die für eine Plattformanwendung gewährte Berechtigung zu widerrufen, besuchen Sie bitte Ihre Einstellungen. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass Ihre Verbindungen, selbst wenn Sie die für eine Plattformanwendung erteilte Erlaubnis widerrufen, die Plattformanwendung weiterhin verwenden können, sodass die Plattformanwendung weiterhin Zugriff auf bestimmte Informationen über Sie haben kann, genau wie Ihre Verbindungen.

7\. AUFBEWAHRUNG PERSONENBEZOGENER DATEN
========================================

Der Zeitraum, für den wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten aufbewahren, hängt von den Zwecken ab, für die wir sie verwenden. Wir werden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten so lange aufbewahren, wie Ihr Konto aktiv ist, oder solange Sie ein registrierter Kontoinhaber oder Nutzer unserer Dienste sind oder solange wir einen anderen Geschäftszweck dafür haben (z. B. aber nicht beschränkt auf für Unternehmen, Steuer oder rechtliche Zwecke) und danach, nicht länger als gesetzlich vorgeschrieben oder zulässig, oder unsere Richtlinie zur Aufbewahrung von Unterlagen, vernünftigerweise für interne Berichts- und Abstimmungszwecke erforderlich, oder um Ihnen Feedback oder Informationen zu geben, die Sie anfordern könnten. Dieser Aufbewahrungszeitraum unterliegt unserer Prüfung und Änderung. Wir können anonymisierte personenbezogene Daten so lange aufbewahren, wie wir es für angemessen halten.

Nach der Kündigung oder Deaktivierung Ihres Benutzerkontos können wir Ihre Profilinformationen und alle Informationen, die in öffentlichen Bereichen der Websites veröffentlicht werden, aufbewahren. Nach der Kündigung oder Deaktivierung Ihres Benutzerkontos können wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten und andere Daten aufbewahren, werden diese jedoch gemäß den Bedingungen, dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie und den Anforderungen des geltenden Rechts vertraulich behandeln. Wir haben das Recht, alle Ihre personenbezogenen Daten und andere Daten nach der Kündigung Ihres Benutzerkontos ohne vorherige Ankündigung zu löschen.

8\. KEINE ABSICHTLICHE ERHEBUNG VON DATEN VON KINDERN
=====================================================

Wir erheben, erfragen oder speichern wissentlich keine personenbezogenen Daten von Personen unter 18 Jahren und gestatten diesen Personen wissentlich nicht, sich für unsere Dienste zu registrieren oder diese zu nutzen. Wenn Sie unter 18 Jahre alt sind, senden Sie uns bitte keine personenbezogenen Daten. Sollten wir erfahren, dass wir personenbezogene Daten von einem Kind unter 18 Jahren ohne Überprüfung der elterlichen Einwilligung erhoben haben, werden wir alle wirtschaftlich vertretbaren Anstrengungen unternehmen, um diese Daten aus unserer Datenbank zu löschen.

9\. WO PERSONENBEZOGENE DATEN VERARBEITET UND GESPEICHERT WERDEN; GELTENDES RECHT
=================================================================================

Wir haben unseren Hauptsitz in den Vereinigten Staaten. Die personenbezogenen Daten, die wir oder unsere Dienstleister erheben, können auf Servern innerhalb oder außerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten und überall dort gespeichert und verarbeitet werden, wo wir und unsere Dienstleister Einrichtungen auf der ganzen Welt haben, und bestimmte Informationen können für Personen oder Unternehmen außerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten zugänglich sein, die Dienstleistungen für uns erbringen. Sie willigen in die Übertragung und/oder Übertragung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten durch uns und unsere Dienstleister in Rechtsordnungen ein, die möglicherweise kein gleichwertiges Datenschutzniveau bieten wie Ihr Heimatland. Wir werden angemessene Maßnahmen ergreifen, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre personenbezogenen Daten in den Ländern, in denen wir sie verarbeiten, ein angemessenes Schutzniveau erhalten.

Es gelten die US-Gesetze, sofern Sie in den Vereinigten Staaten ansässig sind. Andernfalls werden diese Datenschutzrichtlinie und alle anderen Angelegenheiten in Übereinstimmung mit den Gesetzen der Provinz/des Bundesstaates und der Bundesländer des Landes, in dem Sie wohnen, interpretiert und ausgelegt. Gerichtsbarkeiten außerhalb Ihres Wohnsitzes können andere Datenschutzgesetze als die in Ihrem Land haben, einschließlich des Rechts auf Strafverfolgung und Regierungsbehörden, auf die personenbezogenen Daten zuzugreifen. Soweit wir Daten außerhalb Ihres Landes verarbeiten, führen wir eine Datenschutz-Folgenabschätzung durch, um festzustellen, dass unsere Dienstleister im Wesentlichen das gleiche Schutzniveau bieten können, wie es in Ihrer Gerichtsbarkeit erforderlich ist, und schließen Verträge ab, um die Verpflichtungen zur angemessenen Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten weiter zu stärken.

10\. SICHERHEIT
===============

Wir haben technische und organisatorische Sicherheitsvorkehrungen getroffen, die Ihre personenbezogenen Daten vor versehentlichem Verlust und vor unbefugtem Zugriff, unbefugter Verwendung, Vernichtung, Änderung und Offenlegung schützen sollen. Bitte beachten Sie jedoch, dass das Internet keine zu 100 % sichere Umgebung ist. Es liegt in Ihrer Verantwortung, die Sicherheit Ihrer Anmeldeinformationen zu schützen, bei der Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten über E-Mails, Instant Messaging und ähnliche Kommunikationsmittel vorsichtig zu sein und gute Internet-Sicherheitspraktiken aufrechtzuerhalten. Wir werden Sie niemals per E-Mail nach Ihrem Passwort oder anderen Anmeldedaten für Ihr Konto fragen. Wenn Sie eine solche E-Mail erhalten, senden Sie diese bitte an uns, damit wir die Angelegenheit untersuchen können.

11\. ZUSÄTZLICHE DATENSCHUTZRECHTE BETROFFENER PERSONEN FÜR EINWOHNER BESTIMMTER GERICHTSBARKEITEN, DIE IN DEN ERGÄNZENDEN DATENSCHUTZERKLÄRUNGEN BESCHRIEBEN SIND
==================================================================================================================================================================

Das bedeutet, dass Sie keine Waren oder Dienste an Sie ablehnen, Ihnen unterschiedliche Preise oder Preise in Rechnung stellen oder ein anderes Qualitätsniveau für Produkte oder Dienste bieten, weil Sie Ihre Rechte als betroffene Person ausüben.
* Recht auf Abmeldung (Opt-Out): Sie können verlangen, den Verkauf und die Weitergabe Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, kontextübergreifende verhaltensbezogene oder gezielte Werbung, automatisierte Entscheidungsfindung oder Profilerstellung abzulehnen, soweit solche Aktivitäten nach geltendem Recht definiert und eingeschränkt sind.
* Recht auf Einschränkung oder Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung: Sie können von uns verlangen, die Verarbeitung einiger Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu unterdrücken oder einzustellen, aber wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten weiterhin speichern.
* Recht auf Einschränkung der Verwendung Ihrer sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten: Sie können verlangen, die Verwendung Ihrer sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten auf die nach geltendem Recht zulässigen Zwecke zu beschränken.
* Recht auf Einreichung einer Beschwerde: Sie haben das Recht, eine Beschwerde bei Ihrer lokalen Datenschutzbehörde einzureichen, wenn Sie der Ansicht sind, dass die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten in Bezug auf Sie Ihre Rechte verletzt.
* Recht auf Widerruf der Einwilligung. Soweit unsere Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten ausschließlich auf Ihrer Einwilligung beruht, können Sie diese Einwilligung jederzeit widerrufen.

DATENSCHUTZERKLÄRUNG FÜR EINWOHNER BESTIMMTER US-BUNDESSTAATEN
==============================================================

Wenn Sie Ihren Wohnsitz in Kalifornien, Virginia, Colorado, Utah oder Connecticut haben (hier gelegentlich als „Verbraucher“ bezeichnet), bieten Ihnen die Landesgesetze zusätzliche Rechte in Bezug auf unsere Nutzung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten.

KALIFORNISCHES GESETZ „SHINE THE LIGHT“
---------------------------------------

Abschnitt 1798.83 des kalifornischen Zivilgesetzbuchs (California Civil Code), bekannt als das „Shine-The-Light“-Gesetz, gestattet es allen Benutzern, die in Kalifornien ansässig sind, eine Liste der personenbezogenen Daten (falls vorhanden), die wir im vorangegangenen Kalenderjahr an Dritte für Direktmarketingzwecke weitergegeben haben, sowie die Namen und Adressen dieser Dritten anzufordern und von uns zu erhalten. Anträge können nur einmal jährlich gestellt werden und sind kostenlos.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CalOPPA gilt nur für Unternehmen, die personenbezogene Daten von Einwohnern Kaliforniens erheben.

1. WIE WIR AUF „DO NOT TRACK“-SIGNALE REAGIEREN.

Einige Webbrowser übermitteln ein „Do Not Track“(DNT/GPC)-Signal an die Websites und andere Online-Dienste, die Sie über diesen Webbrowser nutzen. Es gibt bis dato keine einheitlichen Vorschriften dafür, wie, wenn überhaupt, Websites auf dieses Signal reagieren sollten; wir selbst haben jedoch Maßnahmen eingeführt, die bei Empfang eines solchen Signals umgesetzt werden.

2. VERHALTENSTRACKING DURCH DRITTE

Wir können diese Technologien auch verwenden, um Informationen über Ihre Online-Aktivitäten im Laufe der Zeit und über Websites Dritter oder andere Online-Dienste hinweg zu erheben oder personenbezogene Daten mit anderen auf diese Weise erhobenen Informationen zu verknüpfen. Wir können personenbezogene Daten verwenden, um die Klick- und Browsing-Muster der Benutzer zu verfolgen.

Wie oben beschrieben, können wir Ihre Kennungen oder andere identifizierende Informationen, die wir von unseren Websites und Online-Diensten erheben, an nicht verbundene Parteien zum Zwecke der kontextübergreifenden Verhaltensverfolgung im Sinne des Gesetzes von Nevada verkaufen. Sie haben das Recht, den Verkauf oder die Lizenzierung dieser Kategorien von personenbezogenen Daten über Sie an nicht verbundene Parteien abzulehnen.

AUSÜBUNG VON RECHTEN
--------------------

Um die oben beschriebenen Rechte auf Zugriff, Berichtigung, Datenübertragbarkeit und Löschung auszuüben, stellen Sie bitte eine Anfrage an uns, indem Sie unser Webformular [hier](https://company.plugshare.com/privacy-notice.html#data-form) verwenden. Nur Sie oder eine Person, die Sie bevollmächtigt haben, in Ihrem Namen zu handeln, können eine Anfrage in Bezug auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten stellen. Sie können auch im Namen Ihres minderjährigen Kindes eine Anfrage stellen. Wenn wir von einer Person eine Anfrage bezüglich der Ausübung von Rechten in Ihrem Namen erhalten, werden wir die Person um eine Kopie Ihrer unterzeichneten Erlaubnis zur Einreichung einer solchen Anfrage in Ihrem Namen bitten und wir werden Sie kontaktieren, um die Erteilung einer solchen Erlaubnis direkt von Ihnen bestätigen zu lassen. Sie können als Verbraucher nur zweimal innerhalb von 12 Monaten eine Anfrage auf Zugriff oder Datenübertragbarkeit stellen. Der überprüfbare Verbraucherantrag muss:

* Stellen Sie ausreichende Informationen zur Verfügung, die es uns ermöglichen, vernünftigerweise zu überprüfen, ob Sie die Person sind, über die wir personenbezogene Daten erhoben haben oder ob ein autorisierter Vertreter die Anfrage gestellt hat.
* Beschreiben Sie Ihre Anfrage mit ausreichenden Details, die es uns ermöglichen, sie richtig zu verstehen, zu bewerten und darauf zu reagieren.

Wir können Ihre Anfrage nicht beantworten oder Ihnen personenbezogene Daten zur Verfügung stellen, wenn wir nicht in der Lage sind, Ihre Identität oder Ihre Befugnis, die Anfrage zu stellen, zu überprüfen und zu bestätigen, dass sich die personenbezogenen Daten auf Sie beziehen. Wenn Sie eine Anfrage stellen, müssen Sie kein Konto bei uns erstellen. Wir werden personenbezogene Daten, die in einer Anfrage bereitgestellt werden, nur verwenden, um die Identität oder Befugnis des Antragstellers zu überprüfen, die Anfrage zu stellen.

Um wie oben beschrieben Ihr Recht auf Abmeldung von kontextübergreifender verhaltensbezogener Werbung, gezielter Werbung oder der Weitergabe personenbezogener Daten auszuüben, müssen Sie sich von der Plattform abmelden, über die diese Vorgänge stattfinden. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Ihre Abmeldeanfrage nur für das Gerät oder die Plattform gilt, über das/die Sie die Anfrage stellen. Das bedeutet, dass Sie evtl. mehrere Anfragen stellen müssen, um sich von diesen Verarbeitungsvorgängen geräte- oder plattformübergreifend abzumelden. Bitte klicken Sie:

* [hier, um sich von Plugshare.com (Web-Plattform) abzumelden.](#)
* [hier, um sich von der PlugShare-iOS-App abzumelden.](plugshare://ad-preferences)
* [hier, um sich von der PlugShare-Android-App abzumelden.](plugshare://ad-preferences)

### Verifizierungsprozess

Wenn Sie eine Anfrage auf Zugriff auf Ihre Daten oder auf deren Berichtigung oder Löschung oder auf Datenübertragbarkeit stellen, senden wir Ihnen innerhalb von 10 Werktagen eine E-Mail an die E-Mail-Adresse, die wir für Sie hinterlegt haben. In der E-Mail werden Sie gebeten, zu antworten, um Sie als den Verbraucher zu bestätigen, der die Anfrage stellt. Nach Erhalt Ihrer Verifizierung werden wir Ihre Daten mit den Daten in unserer Akte abgleichen. Nach der Überprüfung Ihrer Identität werden wir Ihre Anfrage bearbeiten und innerhalb von 45 Kalendertagen antworten, es sei denn, dass (a) wir Ihre Anfrage nicht verifizieren können, (b) wir nicht in der Lage sind, Sie mit Informationen in unserer Datenbank zu verbinden, oder (c) eine gesetzliche Ausnahme besteht, die uns von der Erfüllung Ihrer Anfrage befreit. Wenn wir mehr Zeit benötigen (bis zu weiteren fünfundvierzig (45) Kalendertagen), werden wir Sie schriftlich über den Grund und den Verlängerungszeitraum informieren.

Wenn wir einer Anfrage nicht nachkommen können, werden wir Ihnen in der Antwort, die wir Ihnen übermitteln, die Gründe dafür erläutern. Bei Anfragen zur Datenübertragbarkeit werden wir ein Format für die Bereitstellung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten wählen, das leicht zu verwenden ist und es Ihnen ermöglichen sollte, die Daten ungehindert von einer Stelle zu einer anderen Stelle zu übermitteln.

Wir erheben keine Gebühr für die Bearbeitung oder Beantwortung Ihrer nachprüfbaren Verbraucheranfrage, es sei denn, dass sie exzessiv, wiederholt oder offensichtlich unbegründet ist. Wenn wir zu dem Schluss gelangen, dass die Anfrage eine Gebühr rechtfertigt, werden wir Ihnen mitteilen, warum wir diese Entscheidung getroffen haben und Ihnen einen Kostenvoranschlag zukommen lassen, bevor wir Ihre Anfrage bearbeiten.

DATENSCHUTZERKLÄRUNGEN FÜR BESTIMMTE NICHT-US-LÄNDER
====================================================

ALLGEMEINE INFORMATIONEN
------------------------

1. ### IHRE SPEZIFISCHE EINWILLIGUNG ZUR VERARBEITUNG VON „SENSIBLEN“ ODER „BESONDEREN“ KATEGORIEN PERSONENBEZOGENER DATEN
    

Gemäß den Datenschutzgesetzen einiger Länder gelten bestimmte Arten von personenbezogenen Daten als „sensible“ oder „besondere“ Kategorien von Informationen. Wir verarbeiten sensible oder besondere Datenkategorien nur selten, es sei denn, dass dies in Ihrem lebenswichtigen Interesse oder im Interesse einer anderen Person liegt. In allen anderen Fällen willigen Sie ausdrücklich darin ein, dass wir sensible oder besondere Kategorien personenbezogener Daten, wie in Abschnitt 1.2 unserer Hauptdatenschutzrichtlinie beschrieben, erheben, verarbeiten und aufbewahren, und willigen auch sonst in die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten in Übereinstimmung mit dieser Datenschutzerklärung ein.

2. ### UNSERE RECHTSGRUNDLAGEN FÜR DIE VERARBEITUNG PERSONENBEZOGENER DATEN
    

Unsere Rechtsgrundlagen für die Erhebung und Nutzung der oben beschriebenen personenbezogenen Daten hängen von den betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten und dem spezifischen Kontext ab, in dem wir sie erheben. Im Allgemeinen erheben und verarbeiten wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nur, wenn wir die personenbezogenen Daten benötigen, um Dienste für Sie zu erbringen, für die Sie einen Vertrag mit uns abgeschlossen haben, oder wenn die Verarbeitung in unserem berechtigten Interesse liegt und nicht durch Ihre Datenschutzinteressen oder Grundrechte und -freiheiten außer Kraft gesetzt wird, stützen wir uns auf Ihre Einwilligung, wenn wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind. In einigen Fällen können wir auch gesetzlich verpflichtet sein, personenbezogene Daten von Ihnen zu erheben oder anderweitig die personenbezogenen Daten benötigen, um Ihre lebenswichtigen Interessen oder die einer anderen Person zu schützen.

BERECHTIGTE INTERESSENGRUNDLAGE FÜR DIE ERHEBUNG PERSONENBEZOGENER DATEN: Die Erhebung und Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten kann für die Zwecke unserer berechtigten Interessen erforderlich sein. Zu diesen berechtigten Interessen können gehören:

* Betrugsprävention
* Gewährleistung der Netzwerk- und Informationssicherheit
* Hinweise auf mögliche kriminelle Handlungen oder Bedrohungen der öffentlichen Sicherheit, einschließlich der Verbesserung des Schutzes unserer Community vor Spam, Belästigung, Verletzung geistigen Eigentums, Kriminalität und Sicherheitsrisiken aller Art sowie der Durchsetzung von Rechtsansprüchen, einschließlich der Untersuchung möglicher Verstöße gegen unsere Nutzungsbedingungen
* wenn wir gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen nachkommen
* Verarbeitung von Daten von Mitarbeitern oder Besuchern, Mitgliedern, Teilnehmern oder Registranten
* die von Ihnen angeforderte Funktion oder Dienste auszuführen
* Bereitstellung unserer Dienste und ihrer Funktionalität für Sie, wenn eine solche Verarbeitung für die Zwecke der von uns oder unseren Dienstleistern im Zusammenhang mit den Diensten verfolgten berechtigten Interessen erforderlich ist
* Direktmarketing
* die relevante und angemessene Beziehung, die wir mit Ihnen haben
* Analysen, z. B. die Anzahl der Besucher, Seitenaufrufe, die Nutzung der Websites usw. zu bewerten, um zu verstehen, wie unsere Websites, Produkte und Dienste genutzt werden, um die Websites und/oder zukünftige Kommunikation zu optimieren und neue Dienste und Website-Funktionen zu entwickeln
* Aktualisierung Ihrer Informationen und Präferenzen
* Angebot und Verbesserung unserer Websites, Produkte und Dienste

Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt nicht für Websites, Anwendungen oder Dienste, die diese Datenschutzrichtlinie nicht anzeigen oder verlinken oder die eine andere Datenschutzrichtlinie anzeigen oder verlinken. Nur für Einwohner und Bürger der EU-Region gilt, soweit eine Definition in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie mit einer Definition gemäß der DSGVO im Widerspruch steht, die DSGVO-Definition.

In Bezug auf die Methode (e) können wir personenbezogene Daten mit Ihrer ausdrücklichen Einwilligung oder auf eine Weise, die Ihre Rechte und Freiheiten nicht überwiegt, an einen Dritten übermittelt, um einen Vertrag mit Ihnen zu erfüllen. Wenn diese personenbezogenen Daten nicht verarbeitet und übermittelt werden, können wir den Vertrag mit Ihnen nicht ausführen oder Sie haben keinen oder alle Vorteile und Funktionen, die mit Ihrer Transaktion verbunden sind.

Möglicherweise müssen wir Ihre Daten auch an andere Konzernunternehmen oder Dienstleister in Ländern außerhalb der EU-Region übermitteln. Dies kann der Fall sein, wenn unsere Server oder Lieferanten und Dienstleister ihren Sitz außerhalb der EU-Region haben oder wenn Sie unsere Produkte und/oder Dienste nutzen, während Sie Länder außerhalb dieser Gebiete besuchen.

Visita al sitio web e información del dispositivo. Recogemos información sobre sus visitas a nuestros Sitios web y el uso de nuestras Aplicaciones móviles, incluidos, entre otros, datos de tráfico, datos de geolocalización, registros y otros datos de comunicación, así como los recursos a los que accede y que utiliza en los Sitios web. Recogemos información sobre su ordenador, dispositivo móvil y conexión a Internet, incluida su dirección IP, sistema operativo, tipo de navegador, patrones de secuencia de clics (es decir, en qué hace clic en un sitio web), la URL del sitio web más reciente que visitó antes de visitar nuestros Sitios web, la cantidad de tiempo que pasó en nuestros Sitios web y las páginas que vio mientras estaba en nuestros Sitios web. Podemos obtener una estimación aproximada de su ubicación de su dirección IP cuando visita nuestros Sitios web. Para los usuarios de nuestras Aplicaciones móviles, también podemos recoger y mantener un historial de su información de ubicación precisa utilizando tecnologías Wi-Fi y/o Bluetooth, así como los identificadores de su dispositivo y las coordenadas GPS (p. ej., latitud/longitud). Si desea evitar la recogida de la información de su ubicación, ajuste su configuración en su dispositivo móvil para limitar el acceso de la aplicación móvil a la información de su ubicación.

Cuando utiliza nuestro sitio web, compartimos la información que recopilamos de usted, como su correo electrónico (en formato hash), dirección IP o información sobre su navegador o sistema operativo, con nuestros socios de identidad/proveedores de servicios. Estos socios devuelven un código de identificación en línea que podemos almacenar en nuestra cookie de origen para nuestro uso en publicidad en línea, en la aplicación y en varios canales, y se puede compartir con empresas de publicidad para habilitar la publicidad dirigida y basada en intereses. Para cancelar este uso, haga clic aquí ([https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/)).

Seguimiento del comportamiento. También podemos utilizar estas tecnologías para recoger información sobre sus actividades en línea a lo largo del tiempo y a través de sitios web de terceros u otros servicios en línea, o asociar Información personal con otra información recogida de esta manera.

Análisis de ubicación: nuestras Aplicaciones móviles y Sitios web de navegador móvil incluyen una funcionalidad (p. ej., para el envío de una reseña de un conductor sobre una instalación de carga) que nos permite identificar la ubicación de un conductor y la de la instalación de carga en que se encuentra actualmente un usuario. Recogemos información como la dirección IP, el ID del dispositivo y la geolocalización. Los usuarios de la Aplicación móvil pueden optar por utilizar las Aplicaciones móviles de forma anónima o iniciar sesión como usuario identificado, en cuyo caso se pueden utilizar los datos personales proporcionados al registrarse.

Para los usuarios de las Aplicaciones móviles, podemos solicitar permiso para acceder a cierta información desde su dispositivo móvil, incluida su lista de contactos, fotos y vídeos, así como micrófono y cámara. Es opcional que nos proporcione acceso a esta información. Sin embargo, es posible que ciertas funciones de las Aplicaciones móviles no funcionen de forma óptima si decide no darnos permiso. 

Balizas web. Las páginas de nuestros Sitios web y nuestros correos electrónicos pueden contener pequeños archivos electrónicos conocidos como balizas web (también denominados gifs transparentes, etiquetas de píxel y gifs de un solo píxel) que nos permiten, por ejemplo, contar  los usuarios que han visitado esas páginas o abierto un correo electrónico y para otras estadísticas relacionadas del sitio web (por ejemplo, registrar la popularidad de cierto contenido del sitio web y verificar la integridad del sistema y del servidor).

Seguimiento de píxeles. Además de utilizar cookies, los Sitios web pueden usar el “seguimiento de píxeles”. El seguimiento de píxeles implica el uso de etiquetas de píxeles que no son visibles para el usuario y constan de algunas líneas de código informático. El seguimiento de píxeles mide la eficacia de los anuncios y compila estadísticas de uso agregadas y específicas. Podemos acceder a estas etiquetas de píxeles para identificar actividades e intereses que nos permitan adaptar mejor nuestros Productos, Servicios y ofertas a sus intereses y necesidades. Por ejemplo, si visita usted nuestros Sitios web desde un anuncio en otro sitio web, la etiqueta de píxel permitirá al anunciante hacer un seguimiento y ver que su anuncio le trajo a usted a los Sitios web. Si visita usted nuestros Sitios web y le enlazamos a otro sitio web, también podremos observar que a usted se le envió a un sitio web de terceros y/o que usted ha efectuado transacciones con dicha web de terceros.

GIF. Podemos utilizar imágenes diminutas conocidas como GIF transparentes para realizar un seguimiento del comportamiento de los usuarios, incluidas estadísticas sobre quién abre nuestros correos electrónicos.

Estos registros de servidor pueden incluir información como qué páginas de los Sitios web visitó, su dirección de protocolo de Internet (“IP”, por sus siglas en inglés), tipo de navegador y otra información sobre cómo interactúa con los Sitios web.

Algunas partes no afiliadas pueden enviarle publicidad o promociones en función de sus respuestas a la encuesta. Nosotros o las partes no afiliadas desarrollamos nuevos programas o productos basados en la información que usted comparte en las encuestas. Podemos utilizar partes no afiliadas a fin de ofrecerle incentivos financieros o de otro tipo para participar en encuestas. Si la entrega de incentivos requiere su información de contacto, es posible que se le pida que proporcione Información personal a la parte no afiliada que se encarga de la oferta de incentivos, y que se utilizará solo con el fin de entregar los incentivos prometidos y verificar su información de contacto. Usted es quien decide si facilita esa información o si desea aprovechar una oferta de incentivo. La parte no afiliada que se encargue de la encuesta le pedirá explícitamente su consentimiento para el uso de cualquier Información personal para los fines establecidos en la encuesta. Para darse de baja de nuestras encuestas, puede enviarnos su solicitud utilizando la información de contacto que aparece más adelante.

Utilizamos cookies, gifs transparentes e información de archivos de registro para: (a) recordar información para que usted no tenga que volver a introducirla durante su visita o la próxima vez que visite los Sitios web; (b) proporcionar datos personalizados, contenido e información personalizados; (c) supervisar la eficacia de nuestros Servicios; (d) supervisar las métricas agregadas, como el número total de visitantes, tráfico y patrones demográficos; (e) diagnosticar o solucionar problemas tecnológicos notificados por nuestros usuarios o ingenieros asociados con determinadas direcciones IP; y/o, (f) ayudarle a acceder eficientemente a su información después de iniciar sesión.

Los datos estadísticos que recogemos automáticamente nos ayudan a mejorar nuestros Sitios web y a ofrecer Productos y Servicios mejores y más personalizados, lo que incluye, entre otras cosas, lo siguiente: calcular el tamaño de nuestra audiencia/visitantes y los patrones de uso, almacenar información sobre sus preferencias, lo que nos permite personalizar y mejorar nuestros sitios web, acelerar sus búsquedas y/o reconocerle cuando vuelve a nuestros sitios web.

Podemos recoger y utilizar la información de su sesión de carga de VE (p. ej., tiempo de carga, consumo de energía, propiedad y datos de la estación, etc.) y la marca, el modelo y el año de su vehículo para administrar su cuenta, como para distinguir entre múltiples vehículos o usuarios que comparten una sola cuenta, y con fines analíticos.

En la medida en que usted no dé su consentimiento a las prácticas de tratamiento de la información aquí establecidas, podrá tener derecho a excluirse de dichas prácticas. Todas las solicitudes de exclusión deben dirigirse a [\[email protected\]](https://company.plugshare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Las solicitudes de exclusión voluntaria tendrán efecto para el tratamiento futuro y no para el tratamiento que se haya producido sobre la base del consentimiento previo.

2.1 TOMA DE DECISIONES AUTOMATIZADA
-----------------------------------

Podemos utilizar la Información personal que nos proporcione y que obtengamos de otras fuentes para entender mejor sus intereses, de modo que podamos intentar predecir qué otros Productos, Servicios e información podrían interesarle más. Esta práctica implica tomar decisiones automatizadas sobre usted basadas en esta información con el fin de permitirnos adaptar mejor nuestras interacciones con usted para que sean más relevantes e interesantes. Puede oponerse a que lo hagamos en cualquier momento o solicitarnos más información sobre la metodología aplicada en nuestros procesos automatizados de toma de decisiones poniéndose en contacto con nosotros (véase la sección 12 más adelante).

2.2 MENSAJES DE TEXTO
---------------------

Nuestros Servicios pueden incluir el envío de mensajes de texto (“SMS”); usted puede recibir hasta dos mensajes por día en su dispositivo inalámbrico (a no ser que se comunique más con nosotros), pero la frecuencia de los mensajes puede variar.  Cuando da su consentimiento expreso para recibir mensajes de texto de nuestra parte y facilita un número de teléfono móvil, está dando su consentimiento expreso para recibir de forma recurrente mensajes de texto informativos y transaccionales de nuestra parte o en nuestro nombre al número que ha facilitado. Al dar su consentimiento expreso para recibir mensajes SMS de nuestra parte y facilitarnos un número de teléfono móvil, usted garantiza y declara que es el propietario del número de teléfono móvil que nos facilita. Podemos utilizar su información para ponernos en contacto con usted en relación con su uso, compras, devoluciones (si están disponibles), actualizaciones del Sitio web, realización de encuestas o comunicaciones informativas y relacionadas con el servicio, incluidas actualizaciones de seguridad importantes. Después de que nos envíe el mensaje SMS “STOP”, le enviaremos un mensaje SMS para confirmar que se ha dado de baja. Como alternativa, puede enviarnos su solicitud por correo electrónico, incluida la dirección de correo electrónico y el número de teléfono que registró con nosotros, o por cualquier medio que considere oportuno. A partir de ese momento, dejará de recibir nuestros mensajes SMS. Si quiere volver a participar, basta con que se registre como la primera vez y empezaremos a enviarle mensajes SMS de nuevo Para obtener ayuda, responda a un texto con AYUDA. Es posible que se le apliquen las tarifas correspondientes a mensajes y datos, según su plan de telefonía móvil. Los operadores no son responsables de mensajes con retraso o no entregados.

2.3 COMPLEMENTOS PARA REDES SOCIALES
------------------------------------

Integramos interfaces o complementos de programas de aplicaciones de redes sociales (“Complementos”) de redes sociales, incluidas Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest y/u posiblemente otras empresas, en los Sitios web. Para registrarse como usuario con nosotros, es posible que tenga la opción de iniciar sesión utilizando su inicio de sesión de Facebook u otro sitio de redes sociales.

Por ejemplo, cuando visita nuestros Sitios web, el complemento crea una conexión directa entre su navegador y el servidor de Facebook. Esto permite a Facebook recibir información sobre su visita a nuestros Sitios web con su dirección IP. Si hace clic en el botón “Me gusta” de Facebook mientras inicia sesión en su cuenta de Facebook, puede vincular el contenido de nuestros Sitios web a su perfil de Facebook. Esto permite a Facebook asignar su visita a nuestros Sitios web a su cuenta de usuario. Tenga en cuenta que, como proveedor de los Sitios web, no recibimos ninguna notificación sobre el contenido de los datos transmitidos o su uso por parte de Facebook. Si no quiere que Facebook asigne su visita a nuestros Sitios web a su cuenta de usuario de Facebook, cierre sesión en su cuenta de usuario de Facebook.

Si inicia sesión a través de un Complemento de redes sociales, nos autoriza a acceder a cierta información de cuenta desde ese sitio de redes sociales, como su perfil público en las redes sociales (de acuerdo con su configuración de privacidad en el sitio de las redes sociales), su dirección de correo electrónico, intereses, sus “me gusta”, género, cumpleaños, estudios, relaciones, intereses, ciudad actual, fotos, descripción personal, lista de amigos, e información y fotos de sus amigos de redes sociales que podrían ser amigos en común de redes sociales con otros usuarios. Los Complementos pueden transferir información sobre usted a la plataforma respectiva del Complemento sin que usted actúe. Esta información puede incluir su número de identificación de usuario de la plataforma, o en qué sitio web se encuentra, entre otros. Interactuar con un Complemento transmitirá información directamente a la red social de ese Complemento y esa información puede ser visible para otros en esa plataforma. Los Complementos se rigen por la política de privacidad del sitio de la red social correspondiente (disponible en su sitio web), y no por nuestra Política de privacidad.

3\. CÓMO DIVULGAMOS INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL A PARTES NO AFILIADAS

3.2 PROVEEDORES DE SERVICIOS, SOCIOS COMERCIALES Y SUBCONTRATISTAS
------------------------------------------------------------------

 Podemos compartir su Información personal con Proveedores de servicios que prestan servicios en nuestro nombre, como se ha mencionado anteriormente. Estos Proveedores de servicios pueden tener acceso a su Información personal para proporcionarnos estos servicios a nosotros o en nuestro nombre. Si contratamos a Proveedores de servicios para cualquiera de los casos anteriores, el uso de la Información personal suya estará sometido a obligaciones de confidencialidad y el uso que hagan los Proveedores de la Información personal se limitará a la prestación de sus servicios en beneficio nuestro. Podemos almacenar Información personal en ubicaciones fuera de nuestro control directo (por ejemplo, en servidores o bases de datos ubicadas o coubicadas con Proveedores de servicios de alojamiento de datos).  

3.3 PUBLICIDAD CONDUCTUAL EN CONTEXTOS CRUZADOS
-----------------------------------------------

Estamos obligados a divulgar si compartimos Información personal con un tercero que participa en publicidad de comportamiento (dirigida) en contextos cruzados. En los doce (12) meses anteriores, hemos divulgado o puede que hayamos divulgado las siguientes categorías de Información personal en un contexto que, según ciertas leyes (p. ej., la CPRA de California, el RGPD o el RGPD del Reino Unido) puede considerarse una venta:

* Identificadores
* Internet u otra actividad de red similar
* Datos de geolocalización

Usted tiene la posibilidad de excluirse de este intercambio haciendo clic en las indicaciones de exclusión que aparecerán en el aviso que se le envía cuando visite por primera vez nuestras aplicaciones móviles o Sitios web.

3.4 TRANSFERENCIAS COMERCIALES
------------------------------

Usted reconoce (y no se opondrá a) nuestra divulgación o transferencia de su Información personal, Información personal anonimizada, y demás información que nos proporcione, así como los derechos que ha otorgado o reconocido en esta Política de privacidad (conjuntamente, “Información transferida”) en favor de un comprador potencial o real de nuestra empresa u otro sucesor con el fin de considerar o someterse a una fusión, desinversión, reestructuración, reorganización, disolución, cambio de control, o transferencia de algunos o todos nuestros activos (denominándose cada una de las anteriores eventualidades, una “Transferencia”), ya sea como empresa en operación o como parte de un proceso concursal, de liquidación u otro procedimiento judicial, en el que la Información personal que tenemos se encuentre entre los activos transferidos, y usted acepta no oponerse a dicha divulgación y/o transferencia. No podemos hacer ninguna declaración con respecto al uso o transferencia de la Información transferida que tengamos en caso de concurso, reorganización, insolvencia, administración judicial o cesión en beneficio de acreedores. Además, excepto según lo exija la ley, no somos ni seremos responsables de ninguna violación de la seguridad de datos por parte de ninguna parte no afiliada ni de ninguna acción de parte alguna no afiliada que reciba Información transferida de la que se nos divulgue.

3.5 DIVULGACIONES REQUERIDAS; PROTECCIÓN DE DERECHOS; SEGURIDAD
---------------------------------------------------------------

Salvo que se describa lo contrario en esta Política de privacidad, no divulgaremos su Información personal a ninguna parte no afiliada a menos que lo exija la ley, una orden judicial o un proceso legal (p. ej., citación), incluyendo, entre otros, para responder a cualquier gobierno, órgano regulador o solicitud de licencia, o si creemos que dicha acción es necesaria para: (a) cumplir con la ley, cumplir con procesos legales que nos sean notificados a nosotros o a nuestras filiales, subsidiarias, proveedores contratados o socios afines, o investigar, prevenir o tomar medidas en relación con actividades ilegales supuestas o reales; (b) hacer cumplir nuestras Condiciones o el contrato del cliente (incluido a efectos de facturación y cobro); (c) tomar precauciones contra posibles responsabilidades; (d) investigar y defendernos contra cualquier reclamación o alegación de terceros; (e) ayudar a las agencias de cumplimiento del gobierno o cumplir con los requisitos de seguridad nacionales o de otro tipo; (f) proteger la seguridad o integridad de nuestros Sitios web, nuestros Servicios y aplicaciones móviles; o (g) ejercer o proteger los derechos, la propiedad o la seguridad personal nuestra, de nuestros usuarios o de terceros. 

Intentaremos informarle, cuando sea posible, de estas solicitudes a menos que: (i) la notificación esté prohibida por el propio proceso legal, por una orden judicial que recibamos o por la legislación aplicable, o (ii) creamos que informar sería inútil, ineficaz, crearía un riesgo de lesiones o daños físicos o de otro tipo a un individuo o grupo, o crearía o aumentaría un riesgo de fraude para nosotros, nuestros usuarios, nuestros Sitios web, Servicios o aplicaciones móviles. En los casos en que cumplamos con las solicitudes legales sin previo aviso por estas razones, intentaremos informar a ese usuario de la solicitud después del hecho si determinamos de buena fe que ya no se nos prohíbe legalmente hacerlo y no se aplican los escenarios de riesgo descritos en este párrafo.

3.6 DIVULGACIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL ANONIMIZADA
---------------------------------------------------

Podemos compartir información personal no identificable (incluidos, entre otros, datos de uso anónimos, páginas y URL de referencia/salida, dirección IP, tipos de plataforma, número de clics, etc.) con partes no afiliadas de la forma que elijamos y con cualquier fin, como la administración del sistema y la supervisión del uso de los Sitios web; la medición del número de visitas a nuestros Sitios web, el tiempo medio de permanencia, el número de páginas visitadas; y la supervisión de otras estadísticas del Sitio web para mejorar el contenido.

4\.  SOLICITUDES DE “NO RASTREAR”
=================================

Algunos navegadores web (incluidos Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox y Chrome) incorporan una función “No rastrear” (“DNT”, por sus siglas en inglés) o similar que indica a los sitios web que un usuario no desea que se realice un seguimiento de su actividad y comportamiento en línea. Si un sitio web que responde a una señal DNT en particular recibe la señal DNT, el navegador puede bloquear ese sitio web para que no recoja cierta información sobre el usuario del navegador. No todos los navegadores ofrecen una opción DNT y las señales DNT aún no son uniformes. Por este motivo, muchos operadores de sitios web, incluido PlugShare, no responden a las señales DNT.

5\. COMUNICACIONES DE PLUGSHARE, PREFERENCIAS Y BAJA VOLUNTARIA
===============================================================

Al proporcionarnos su dirección de correo electrónico, usted acepta que utilicemos la dirección de correo electrónico para enviarle avisos relacionados con el Servicio por correo electrónico, incluidos, entre otros, cualquier aviso que exija la ley (p. ej., aviso de incidentes de privacidad de datos o seguridad), en lugar de la comunicación por correo postal. También acepta que podemos enviarle notificaciones de actividad con respecto a nuestros Productos, Servicios, Sitios web, aplicaciones móviles, su Información personal o cualquier aspecto de nuestra relación, a la dirección de correo electrónico que nos proporcione, de acuerdo con cualquier configuración de privacidad aplicable. Podemos utilizar su dirección de correo electrónico para enviarle otros mensajes o contenido, como, entre otros, boletines informativos, adiciones o cambios en las funciones del Servicio u ofertas especiales. Si no desea recibir dichos mensajes de correo electrónico, puede optar por no recibirlos haciendo clic en Darse de baja cuando esté disponible. Si decide darse de baja, es posible que no reciba mensajes de correo electrónico sobre actualizaciones, mejoras, funciones especiales, anuncios u ofertas. No puede darse de baja de los correos electrónicos relacionados con el Servicio. Si ha elegido no facilitarnos un correo electrónico u otra dirección, es posible que no reciba nuestros correos electrónicos relacionados con el Servicio.

A través de la página de configuración de su cuenta de usuario, puede acceder y, en algunos casos, editar o eliminar cierta información que nos ha facilitado, como nombre y contraseña, dirección de correo electrónico, dirección postal, información de perfil de usuario, etc. La información que puede ver, actualizar y eliminar puede cambiar a medida que cambien los Productos, los Sitios web, los Servicios o nuestras prácticas. Si tiene alguna pregunta sobre cómo ver o actualizar la información que tenemos registrada sobre usted, póngase en contacto con nosotros. Sin embargo, cuando actualiza información, podemos conservar una copia de la información no revisada en nuestros registros. Puede solicitar la eliminación de su cuenta enviándonos un correo electrónico. Es responsabilidad suya que la dirección de correo electrónico que tenemos de usted esté actualizada. Dependiendo del estado o país en el que resida, puede tener derechos adicionales. Para más información, véase más abajo.

6\. DESARROLLADORES QUE UTILIZAN SERVICIOS DE PLATAFORMA PLUGSHARE
==================================================================

Colaboramos y permitimos que terceros utilicen la plataforma de desarrolladores de PlugShare para ofrecer servicios y funcionalidades junto con PlugShare. Estos desarrolladores externos han negociado un acuerdo para utilizar la tecnología de plataforma PlugShare o han aceptado nuestras interfaces de programación de aplicaciones (“API”, por sus siglas en inglés) y las condiciones de los Complementos para crear aplicaciones de plataforma de software (“Aplicaciones de plataforma”). Tanto los acuerdos negociados como nuestras condiciones de uso de API y Complementos contienen restricciones sobre cómo los terceros pueden acceder, almacenar y utilizar la Información personal que usted proporciona a PlugShare. Si decide utilizar una Aplicación de plataforma, se le pedirá que confirme la aceptación de la política de privacidad y el acuerdo de usuario del desarrollador externo. Para revocar el permiso otorgado a una Aplicación de plataforma, visite su configuración. Sin embargo, tenga en cuenta que incluso si retira el permiso otorgado a una Aplicación de plataforma, sus conexiones pueden seguir utilizando la Aplicación de plataforma, por lo que la Aplicación de plataforma puede seguir teniendo acceso a cierta información sobre usted, igual que sus conexiones.

7\. RETENCIÓN DE INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL
=====================================

El periodo de tiempo durante el cual conservamos su Información personal depende de los fines para los que la utilicemos. Conservaremos su Información personal mientras su cuenta esté activa, o siempre que usted sea titular de cuenta registrado o usuario de nuestros Servicios o mientras tengamos otro fin comercial para hacerlo (como, por ejemplo, entre otros, con fines comerciales, fiscales o legales) y, a partir de entonces, no más tiempo del exigido o permitido por la ley, o por nuestra política de conservación de registros, o el necesario a efectos de informes internos y conciliación, o para proporcionarle comentarios o información que solicite. Este periodo de retención está sujeto a nuestra revisión y modificación. Podemos retener Información personal no identificada durante el tiempo que consideremos apropiado.

Tras la terminación o desactivación de su cuenta de usuario, podemos retener su información de perfil y toda la información publicada en áreas públicas de los Sitios web. Tras la terminación o desactivación de su cuenta de usuario, podemos retener su Información personal y otros datos, pero la mantendremos como confidencial de acuerdo con las Condiciones, esta Política de privacidad y según lo exija la legislación aplicable. Tenemos derecho a eliminar toda su Información personal y demás datos después de la terminación de su cuenta de usuario sin previo aviso.

8\. NO RECOPILAMOS INTENCIONADAMENTE DATOS DE MENORES
=====================================================

No recogemos, solicitamos ni conservamos conscientemente Información personal de personas menores de 18 años ni permitimos conscientemente que dichas personas se registren o utilicen nuestros Servicios. Si es menor de 18 años, no nos envíe Información personal. En caso de que tengamos conocimiento de que hemos recogido Información personal de un menor de 18 años sin la verificación del consentimiento de los padres, haremos todo lo posible, dentro de lo razonable desde el punto de vista comercial, para eliminar esa información de nuestra base de datos.

9\. CUÁNDO SE TRATA Y ALMACENA INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL; LEGISLACIÓN APLICABLE
==========================================================================

Tenemos nuestra sede central en los Estados Unidos. La Información personal que nosotros o nuestros Proveedores de servicios recogemos puede almacenarse y tratarse en servidores dentro o fuera de los Estados Unidos y dondequiera que nosotros y nuestros Proveedores de servicios tengamos instalaciones en todo el mundo, y cierta información puede ser accesible por personas o empresas fuera de los Estados Unidos que nos prestan servicios. Usted consiente que nosotros y nuestros Proveedores de Servicios transmitamos y/o transfiramos su Información Personal a jurisdicciones que pueden no proporcionar niveles de protección de datos equivalentes a los de su jurisdicción de origen, o que accedamos a ella en dichas jurisdicciones. Tomaremos medidas razonables para garantizar que su Información personal reciba un nivel adecuado de protección en las jurisdicciones en las que la tratamos.

Las leyes estadounidenses se aplican en la medida en que usted sea residente de los Estados Unidos. De lo contrario, esta Política de privacidad y todos los demás aspectos se interpretarán de acuerdo con las leyes provinciales/estatales y federales de la jurisdicción en la que usted resida. Las jurisdicciones ajenas a su lugar de residencia podrían tener leyes de privacidad diferentes a las suyas, incluido el derecho de las autoridades policiales y gubernamentales a acceder a la Información personal.  Cuando tratamos datos fuera de su país, llevamos a cabo una evaluación del impacto sobre la privacidad para determinar si nuestros Proveedores de servicios pueden ofrecer prácticamente el mismo nivel de protección que el exigido en su jurisdicción y establecemos contratos para reforzar aún más las obligaciones de tratar adecuadamente su Información personal.

10\. SEGURIDAD
==============

Hemos implementado medidas de seguridad técnicas y organizativas diseñadas para proteger su Información personal frente a la pérdida accidental y al acceso, uso, destrucción, alteración y divulgación no autorizados. Sin embargo, tenga en cuenta que Internet no es un entorno 100 % seguro. Es su responsabilidad proteger la seguridad de su información de inicio de sesión, tener cuidado al transmitir cualquier Información personal a través de correos electrónicos, mensajería instantánea y medios de comunicación similares, y mantener buenas prácticas de seguridad de Internet. Nunca le enviaremos un correo electrónico para pedirle su contraseña u otra información de inicio de sesión de la cuenta. Si recibe dicho correo electrónico, envíenoslo para que podamos investigarlo.

11\. DERECHOS ADICIONALES DE LOS INTERESADOS PARA RESIDENTES EN CIERTAS JURISDICCIONES DESCRITAS EN LOS AVISOS DE PRIVACIDAD COMPLEMENTARIOS

AVISO DE PRIVACIDAD PARA RESIDENTES DE CIERTOS ESTADOS DE EE. UU.
=================================================================

Si usted reside en California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah o Connecticut (en lo sucesivo, “Consumidor”), las leyes estatales le otorgan derechos adicionales con respecto al uso que hacemos de su Información personal.

LEY “SHINE THE LIGHT” DE CALIFORNIA
-----------------------------------

La sección 1798.83 del Código Civil de California, conocida como la Ley “Shine The Light”, permite a cualquier usuario que sea residente de California solicitar y obtener de nosotros una lista de qué Información personal (si la hubiera) divulgamos a terceros con fines de marketing directo en el año natural anterior y los nombres y direcciones de esos terceros. Las solicitudes solo se pueden realizar una vez al año y son gratuitas.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

La CalOPPA solo se aplica a empresas que recogen Información personal de residentes de California.

1. CÓMO RESPONDEMOS A LAS SEÑALES DE NO RASTREAR.

Algunos navegadores web transmiten señales de "no rastrear" (DNT/GPC) a los sitios web y otros servicios en línea con los que se comunica su navegador web. En la actualidad no existe ninguna norma que regule qué deben hacer los sitios web, si es que deben hacer algo, cuando reciben estas señales; sin embargo, actualmente contamos con medidas para actuar en respuesta a estas señales.

2. SEGUIMIENTO DEL COMPORTAMIENTO DE TERCEROS

También podemos utilizar estas tecnologías para recopilar información sobre sus actividades en línea a lo largo del tiempo y a través de sitios web de terceros u otros servicios en línea, o asociar Información personal con otra información recopilada de esta manera. Podemos utilizar Información personal no identificada para realizar un seguimiento de los patrones de navegación y clic de los usuarios.

INFORMACIÓN GENERAL
-------------------

1. ### SU CONSENTIMIENTO ESPECÍFICO PARA EL TRATAMIENTO DE CATEGORÍAS “SENSIBLES” O “ESPECIALES” DE INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL
    

Según las leyes de privacidad de algunos países, ciertos tipos de Información personal se consideran categorías de información “sensible” o “especial”. Rara vez tratamos datos sensibles o de categorías especiales, a menos que lo hagamos en su interés vital o en el de otra persona. Para todas las demás circunstancias, usted consiente específicamente en que recojamos, tratemos y conservemos categorías sensibles o especiales de Información personal según se describe en la sección 1.2 de nuestra Política de privacidad principal y, de lo contrario, consiente el tratamiento de Información personal de acuerdo con este Aviso de privacidad.  

2. ### NUESTRAS BASES JURÍDICAS PARA EL TRATAMIENTO DE INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL
    

Nuestras bases jurídicas para recoger y utilizar la Información personal descrita anteriormente dependerán de la Información personal en cuestión y del contexto específico en el que la recojamos. En términos generales, recogeremos y trataremos su Información personal únicamente cuando la necesitemos para prestarle los Servicios que haya contratado con nosotros, o cuando el tratamiento responda a nuestros intereses legítimos y no prevalezcan sus intereses en materia de protección de datos o sus derechos y libertades fundamentales, y nos basaremos en su consentimiento cuando estemos legalmente obligados a hacerlo. En algunos casos, también podemos tener la obligación legal de recoger Información personal de usted o quizá necesitemos la Información personal para proteger sus intereses vitales o los de otra persona.

BASE DE INTERÉS LEGÍTIMO PARA RECOGER INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL: La recogida y el tratamiento de su Información personal pueden ser necesarios para los fines de nuestros intereses legítimos. Dichos fines de interés legítimo pueden incluir:

* prevenir el fraude
* garantizar la seguridad de la red y la información
* indicar posibles actos delictivos o amenazas a la seguridad pública, incluida la mejora de la protección de nuestra comunidad contra el spam, el acoso, la infracción de la propiedad intelectual, los delitos y los riesgos de seguridad de todo tipo, y la aplicación de reclamaciones legales, incluida la investigación de posibles infracciones de nuestras Condiciones de uso
* cuando cumplamos obligaciones legales
* tratar datos de empleados o visitantes, miembros, asistentes o inscritos
* realizar la función o el servicio que nos solicitó
* proporcionarle nuestros Servicios y su funcionalidad cuando dicho tratamiento sea necesario a efectos de los intereses legítimos que nosotros o nuestros proveedores de servicios tengamos en relación con los Servicios
* marketing directo
* la relación relevante y apropiada que tenemos con usted
* llevar a cabo análisis, p. ej., evaluar el número de visitantes, vistas de página, uso de los Sitios web, etc., para entender cómo se utilizan nuestros Sitios web, Productos y Servicios, para optimizar los Sitios web y/o futuras comunicaciones, y para desarrollar nuevos servicios y características del Sitio web
* actualizar su información y preferencias
* ofrecer y mejorar nuestros Sitios web, Productos y Servicios
* hacer cumplir las reclamaciones legales, incluida la investigación de posibles infracciones de nuestras Condiciones

Además de la información proporcionada anteriormente, las siguientes secciones solo se aplican a los residentes o ciudadanos del país o región analizados. A los efectos de las siguientes secciones, a menos que se mencione específicamente, la definición de “Información personal” utilizada anteriormente tendrá la definición de información personal, datos personales o término similar, según corresponda, que contemplen las leyes de privacidad de datos de ese país o región. En caso de conflicto entre las secciones siguientes y las anteriores, prevalecerán las secciones siguientes.

RGPD: AVISO DE PRIVACIDAD PARA RESIDENTES EN EL ESPACIO ECONÓMICO EUROPEO (EEE), REINO UNIDO Y SUIZA
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ### DESCRIPCIÓN GENERAL
    

Las siguientes disposiciones se aplican solo si usted es residente del EEE, el Reino Unido o Suiza (denominadas en esta Sección, por comodidad, como la “Región de la UE”).

Para dichos residentes, todo el tratamiento de su Información personal se realiza de acuerdo con los derechos de privacidad y el reglamento, en particular, (UE) 2016/679 del Parlamento Europeo y del Consejo, de 27 de abril de 2016, conocido como el Reglamento General de Protección de Datos o el Reglamento General de Protección de Datos del Reino Unido para residentes del Reino Unido (conjuntamente, el “RGPD”), y nuestro tratamiento tendrá lugar de acuerdo con el RGPD. A los efectos del RGPD, seremos el “responsable del tratamiento” de la Información personal (denominada y definida en el RGPD, disponible [aquí](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/), como “datos personales”) que recogemos, a menos que recojamos dicha información en nombre de un “responsable del tratamiento”, en cuyo caso seremos un “encargado del tratamiento”. Esta Política de privacidad no se aplica a sitios web, aplicaciones o servicios que no muestren, o enlacen con,  esta Política de privacidad o que muestren o enlacen con una política de privacidad diferente. Solo para residentes y ciudadanos de la Región de la UE, en la medida en que cualquier definición de esta Política de privacidad entre en conflicto con una definición conforme al RGPD, prevalecerá la definición del RGPD.

Proporcionamos la protección adecuada para la transferencia de Información personal a países fuera de la Región de la UE a través de uno o más de los siguientes métodos: (a) una serie de acuerdos interempresariales basados en, o que incorporen, las Cláusulas contractuales tipo, (b) podemos basarnos en las decisiones de adecuación de la Comisión Europea sobre ciertos países, según corresponda, (c) podemos obtener su consentimiento para estas transferencias de datos desde la Región de la UE a los Estados Unidos a otros países, (d) podemos adoptar normas corporativas vinculantes, o (e) en la medida aplicable, podemos basarnos en excepciones según lo establecido en el artículo 49 del RGPD para la transferencia y transferencia ulterior de la Información personal recogida de personas en la Región de la UE a los Estados Unidos y demás países que la Región de la UE considera que no proporcionan una protección de datos adecuada. Con respecto al método (e), podemos transferir Información personal a un tercero para ejecutar un contrato con usted, con su consentimiento explícito o de una manera que no afecte a sus derechos y libertades. Si esta Información personal no se trata ni se transfiere, no podremos ejecutar el contrato con usted o usted no tendrá acceso a determinados o a ninguno de los beneficios y características que se asocian con su transacción.

También es posible que tengamos que transferir su información a otras empresas del grupo o proveedores de servicios en países fuera de la Región de la UE. Esto puede suceder si nuestros servidores o proveedores y proveedores de servicios están ubicados fuera de la Región de la UE, o si utiliza nuestros Productos y/o Servicios mientras visita países fuera de estas zonas.

Se analizan nuestras bases jurídicas para recoger su Información personal.

2. ### SUS DERECHOS DE DATOS EN VIRTUD DEL RGPD.
    

Si está sujeto al RGPD, sus derechos incluyen el derecho a:

* Derecho a saber.
* Derecho de corrección.
* Derecho de supresión.
* Derecho a limitar u oponerse al tratamiento. Tiene derecho a oponerse a que su Información personal se utilice de las siguientes maneras: (a) tratamiento basado en intereses legítimos o en la realización de una tarea en interés público/ejercicio de la autoridad oficial (incluida la elaboración de perfiles); (b) marketing directo (incluida la elaboración de perfiles); y (c) tratamiento para fines de investigación científica/histórica y estadísticas. Para más información, véase más adelante.
* Derecho de exclusión. Tiene derecho a no estar sujeto a una decisión basada únicamente en el tratamiento automatizado, incluida la elaboración de perfiles, que produzca efectos legales sobre usted o le afecte de forma significativa, excepto por las excepciones aplicables en virtud de las leyes de protección de datos pertinentes.
* Derecho a presentar una reclamación. Si reside dentro del EEE, puede encontrar una lista de las autoridades nacionales de protección de datos [aquí](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm). Si reside en el Reino Unido, puede ponerse en contacto con la Oficina del Comisionado de Información [aquí.](https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/)
* Derecho a retirar el consentimiento.

Pour les utilisateurs de nos Applications mobiles, nous pouvons également recueillir et maintenir un historique de vos renseignements de localisation précis à l’aide des technologies Wi-Fi et/ou Bluetooth, ainsi que les identifiants de votre appareil et les coordonnées GPS (p. ex., latitude/longitude). Si vous souhaitez empêcher la collecte de vos renseignements de localisation, veuillez ajuster vos paramètres dans votre appareil mobile afin de limiter l’accès de l’Application mobile à vos renseignements de localisation.

Lorsque vous utilisez notre site Web, nous partageons les informations que nous recueillons auprès de vous, telles que votre adresse e-mail (sous forme hachée), votre adresse IP ou des informations sur votre navigateur ou votre système d'exploitation, avec nos partenaires d'identité/fournisseurs de services. Ces partenaires renvoient un code d'identification en ligne que nous pouvons stocker dans notre cookie propriétaire pour notre utilisation dans la publicité en ligne, intégrée à l'application et multicanal et il peut être partagé avec des sociétés de publicité pour permettre une publicité ciblée et basée sur les centres d'intérêt. Pour refuser cette utilisation, veuillez cliquer ici ([https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/)).

Suivi comportemental. Nous pouvons également utiliser ces technologies pour recueillir des informations sur vos activités en ligne au fil du temps et sur des sites Web de tiers ou d’autres services en ligne, ou associer des Renseignements personnels à d’autres informations recueillies de cette manière.

Analyse de l’emplacement : Nos Applications mobiles et nos Sites Web de navigateur mobile comprennent des fonctionnalités (p. ex., pour la soumission d’un examen par le conducteur d’une installation de recharge) qui nous permettent d’identifier l’emplacement du conducteur et l’emplacement de la installation de recharge où un utilisateur est actuellement situé. Nous recueillons des informations telles que l’adresse IP, l’identifiant de l’appareil et la géolocalisation. Les utilisateurs des Applications mobiles peuvent choisir d’utiliser les Applications mobiles de manière anonyme ou de se connecter en tant qu’utilisateur identifié, auquel cas les données personnelles fournies lors de l’inscription peuvent être utilisées.

Pour les utilisateurs des Applications mobiles, nous pouvons demander la permission d’accéder à certains renseignements à partir de votre appareil mobile, y compris votre liste de contacts, vos photos et vidéos, ainsi que votre microphone et votre appareil photo. L’accès à ces renseignements est facultatif. Cependant, certaines fonctionnalités des Applications mobiles pourraient ne pas fonctionner de manière optimale si vous décidez de ne pas nous donner votre autorisation.

Balises Web. Les pages de nos Sites Web et nos courriels peuvent contenir de petits fichiers électroniques connus sous le nom de balises Web (également appelées pixels invisibles, balises pixel et gifs à pixel unique) qui nous permettent, par exemple, de compter les utilisateurs qui ont visité ces pages ou ouvert un courriel et de réaliser d’autres statistiques connexes sur les sites Web (par exemple, enregistrer la popularité de certains contenus de sites Web et vérifier l’intégrité du système et du serveur).

Suivi des pixels. En plus d’utiliser des témoins, les Sites Web peuvent utiliser le « suivi des pixels ». Le suivi des pixels implique l’utilisation de pixels invisibles pour l’utilisateur et composés de quelques lignes de code informatique. Le suivi des pixels mesure l’efficacité des publicités et compile des statistiques d’utilisation globales et spécifiques. Nous pouvons accéder à ces pixels invisibles pour identifier l’activité et les intérêts qui peuvent nous permettre de mieux adapter nos Produits, Services et offres à vos intérêts et besoins. Par exemple, si vous visitez nos Sites Web à partir d’une publicité sur un autre site Web, le pixel invisible permettra à l’annonceur de savoir que sa publicité vous a amené sur les Sites Web. Si vous visitez nos Sites Web et que nous vous dirigeons vers un autre site Web, nous pouvons également être en mesure de déterminer que vous avez été envoyé vers un site Web tiers et/ou que vous avez effectué une transaction avec celui-ci.

GIF. Nous pouvons utiliser de minuscules images appelées GIF clairs pour suivre le comportement des utilisateurs, y compris des statistiques sur les personnes qui ouvrent nos courriels.

Adresse IP. Nos serveurs (ou ceux de nos fournisseurs de services) enregistrent automatiquement certaines informations de fichier journal signalées à partir de votre navigateur lorsque vous accédez aux sites Web. Ces journaux de serveur peuvent inclure des informations telles que les pages des sites Web que vous avez visitées, votre adresse de protocole Internet (« IP »), votre type de navigateur et d’autres informations sur la façon dont vous interagissez avec les Sites Web. Ces fichiers journaux sont généralement supprimés périodiquement.

Mesures et analyses de tiers. Les mesures et analyses de tiers, sur certaines pages ou fonctionnalités des Services, nous aident à comprendre et à analyser le trafic des visiteurs, à mesurer l’efficacité des promotions et l’efficacité de nos fonctionnalités, offres et campagnes de marketing. Nous utilisons également ces outils pour identifier les écueils, les défauts et les domaines de nos opérations qui doivent être améliorés, et pour visualiser le rendement global et le classement de notre présence en ligne. Ces outils peuvent stocker des témoins sur votre appareil à leur discrétion.

AVIS ET POLITIQUE SUR LES TÉMOINS

Les technologies que nous utilisons pour recueillir automatiquement des données comprennent également des témoins, comme décrit ci-dessous.

Témoins du navigateur

Les témoins de navigateur sont de petits fichiers placés sur le disque dur de votre ordinateur ou de votre appareil mobile. Ils peuvent contenir certaines données, y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, le nom du serveur qui les a placés, un identifiant sous la forme d’un numéro unique, et, une date d’expiration (certains témoins uniquement). Les témoins de navigateur sont gérés par le navigateur Web (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, etc.) de votre ordinateur ou de votre appareil mobile. Différents types de témoins ayant des objectifs différents sont utilisés sur nos Sites Web.

Témoins essentiels

Les témoins essentiels sont indispensables pour vous permettre de naviguer sur nos Sites Web et d’utiliser ses fonctions. Sans eux, des services tels que les paniers de magasinage et la facturation électronique ne pourraient pas fonctionner.

Témoins de performance

Les témoins de rendement recueillent des informations sur l’utilisation de nos Sites Web, comme les pages les plus souvent consultées. Ces renseignements nous permettent d’optimiser nos Sites Web et de simplifier la navigation. Les témoins de performance permettent également à nos sociétés affiliées et partenaires de savoir si vous avez accédé à l’une des pages de notre Site Web depuis leur site et si votre visite a conduit à l’utilisation ou à l’achat d’un Produit ou d’un Service sur nos Sites Web, y compris les références du Produit ou du Service acheté. Toutes les informations recueillies par les témoins de performance sont agrégées, et donc anonymes.

Témoins de fonctionnalité

Les témoins de fonctionnalité permettent à nos Sites Web de se souvenir des choix que vous avez faits lorsque vous naviguez. Par exemple, nous pouvons enregistrer votre position géographique dans un témoin afin d’afficher les Sites Web correspondant à votre région. Nous pouvons également nous souvenir de vos préférences, telles que la taille du texte, la police et d’autres aspects personnalisables des Sites Web. Les témoins de fonctionnalité peuvent également permettre de garder une trace des produits ou des vidéos consultés afin d’éviter les répétitions. Les informations recueillies par ces témoins ne peuvent pas être utilisées pour vous identifier et ne peuvent pas surveiller votre activité de navigation sur des sites Web qui ne nous appartiennent pas. Les témoins de fonctionnalité nous permettent d’afficher des publicités qui vous sont adaptées sur nos sites Web, de comprendre quelles parties de notre contenu vous intéressent le plus et quelles catégories de Produits ou de Services vous demandez. Certains de nos prestataires de services sont autorisés à placer des témoins sur nos Sites Web. Ces sociétés peuvent également vous offrir la possibilité d’empêcher l’utilisation des témoins à l’avenir.

À tout moment, vous pouvez empêcher ou refuser l’utilisation future de certains témoins en activant le paramètre approprié de votre navigateur pour refuser les témoins de navigation. Toutefois, si vous le faites, votre expérience sur nos Sites Web peut être affectée; par exemple, vous pouvez être incapable d’accéder à certaines parties de nos Sites Web. À moins que vous n’ayez réglé les paramètres de votre navigateur pour qu’il refuse les témoins, notre système émettra des témoins lorsque vous dirigerez votre navigateur vers nos Sites Web.

Témoins de stockage local

Certaines fonctionnalités de nos Sites Web peuvent utiliser des objets stockés localement (pour recueillir et stocker des informations sur vos préférences et votre navigation vers, depuis et sur nos Sites Web. Les témoins de stockage local ne sont pas gérés par les mêmes paramètres que ceux utilisés pour les témoins de navigateur.

Nous pouvons également combiner les Renseignements personnels que nous recueillons auprès de vous en dehors de nos Sites Web ou Services avec des Renseignements personnels recueillis par l’intermédiaire de nos Sites Web ou Services ou par d’autres moyens comme décrits ci-dessus.

1.5 INFORMATIONS SUR LES APPAREILS, LE RÉSEAU, LA GÉOLOCALISATION ET LES VE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lorsque vous visitez ou quittez nos Sites Web ou nos Services en cliquant sur un hyperlien ou en affichant un plugiciel sur un site Web tiers, nous recevons automatiquement l’URL du site d’où vous venez ou celui vers lequel vous êtes dirigé. De même, les annonceurs reçoivent l’URL de la page sur laquelle vous vous trouvez lorsque vous cliquez sur une publicité qui peut apparaître sur nos Services. Nous recevons également l’adresse de protocole Internet (« IP ») de votre ordinateur ou du serveur proxy que vous utilisez pour accéder à Internet, les détails du système d’exploitation de votre ordinateur, votre type de navigateur Web, votre appareil mobile (y compris l’identifiant de votre appareil mobile fourni par le système d’exploitation de votre appareil mobile), votre système d’exploitation mobile (si vous accédez à nos sites Web ou services à l’aide d’un appareil mobile) et le nom de votre fournisseur d’accès à Internet ou de votre opérateur mobile.

1.6 SONDAGES
------------

Nous ou des parties non affiliées pouvons mener des sondages auprès des utilisateurs concernant nos Services. Certaines parties non affiliées peuvent vous adresser des publicités ou des promotions en fonction de vos réponses au sondage. Nous ou des parties non affiliées développons de nouveaux programmes ou produits sur la base des renseignements que vous partagez dans les sondages. Nous pouvons faire appel à des parties non affiliées pour vous offrir des incitatifs financiers ou autres à participer à des sondages. Si la fourniture d’incitations nécessite vos coordonnées, il se peut que l’on vous demande de fournir des Renseignements personnels à la partie non affiliée qui réalise l’offre d’incitation, qui ne seront utilisés que dans le but de fournir les incitations promises et de vérifier vos coordonnées. C’est à vous de décider si vous fournissez ces informations ou si vous souhaitez profiter d’une offre incitative. Votre consentement à l’utilisation de tout Renseignement personnel aux fins énoncées dans le sondage sera explicitement demandé par la partie non affiliée qui le mène. Pour ne pas participer à nos sondages, vous pouvez nous envoyer votre demande en utilisant les coordonnées ci-dessous.

2\. LA NATURE ET LE BUT DU TRAITEMENT DES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS

Nous pouvons recueillir et utiliser les informations relatives à votre séance de recharge de VE (par exemple, le temps de recharge, la consommation d’énergie, la propriété et les données de la station, etc.) ainsi que la marque, le modèle et l’année de votre véhicule pour gérer votre compte, par exemple pour faire la distinction entre plusieurs véhicules ou utilisateurs partageant un même compte, et à des fins d’analyse.

Dans la mesure où vous ne consentez pas aux pratiques de traitement des renseignements énoncés aux présentes, vous pourriez avoir le droit de vous retirer de ces pratiques. Toutes les demandes de retrait doivent être adressées à [\[email protected\]](https://company.plugshare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Dans la mesure où les demandes de retrait sont honorées, elles auront un effet sur le traitement futur et non sur le traitement qui a déjà eu lieu sur la base d’un consentement préalable.

2.1 PRISE DE DÉCISION AUTOMATISÉE
---------------------------------

Nous pouvons utiliser les Renseignements personnels que vous nous fournissez et ceux que nous obtenons d’autres sources pour mieux comprendre vos intérêts afin d’essayer de prévoir quels autres Produits, Services et informations pourraient vous intéresser le plus. Cette pratique consiste à prendre des décisions automatisées à votre sujet sur la base de ces informations afin de nous permettre de mieux adapter nos interactions avec vous pour les rendre plus pertinentes et intéressantes. Vous pouvez vous opposer à cette pratique à tout moment ou nous demander plus de renseignements sur la méthodologie appliquée dans nos processus de prise de décision automatisée en communiquant avec nous (voir la section 12 ci-dessous).

2.2 MESSAGES TEXTE
------------------

Nos Services peuvent comprendre l’envoi de messages texte (« SMS ») à votre appareil sans fil, qui peuvent transmettre jusqu’à deux messages par jour (à moins que vous ne communiquiez davantage avec nous), mais la fréquence des messages peut varier.  Lorsque vous consentez expressément à recevoir des messages texte de notre part et que vous fournissez un numéro de téléphone cellulaire, vous consentez expressément à recevoir des messages textes d’information et transactionnels récurrents de notre part ou en notre nom au numéro que vous avez fourni. En consentant expressément à recevoir des messages SMS de notre part et en fournissant un numéro de téléphone cellulaire, vous garantissez et déclarez que vous êtes le propriétaire du numéro de téléphone cellulaire que vous nous fournissez. Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements pour communiquer avec vous au sujet de votre utilisation, de vos achats, de vos retours (le cas échéant), des mises à jour du site Web, de la réalisation de sondages ou des communications d’information et liées au service, y compris des mises à jour importantes sur la sécurité. Après que vous nous ayez envoyé le message texte « STOP », nous vous enverrons un message texte pour confirmer que vous avez été désinscrit. Vous pouvez également nous soumettre votre demande par courriel, en indiquant l’adresse courriel et le numéro de téléphone que vous avez enregistrés auprès de nous, ou par tout autre moyen raisonnable. Après cela, vous ne recevrez plus de messages SMS de notre part. Si vous souhaitez vous réinscrire, il vous suffit de vous inscrire comme vous l’avez fait la première fois et nous recommencerons à vous envoyer des SMS. Pour obtenir de l’aide, veuillez répondre à un message texte avec HELP. Des tarifs de messages et de données peuvent s’appliquer, en fonction de votre forfait de téléphone cellulaire. Les transporteurs ne sont pas responsables des messages retardés ou non livrés.

2.3 PLUGICIELS DE MÉDIAS SOCIAUX
--------------------------------

Nous intégrons des interfaces ou des Plugiciels (« Plugiciels ») de programmes de médias sociaux à partir de réseaux sociaux, y compris Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest et/ou possiblement d’autres entreprises, dans les Sites Web. Afin de vous inscrire en tant qu’utilisateur chez nous, vous pouvez avoir la possibilité de vous connecter à l’aide de votre identifiant Facebook ou d’un autre site de médias sociaux.

Par exemple, lorsque vous visitez nos Sites Web, le plugiciel crée une connexion directe entre votre navigateur et le serveur Facebook. Cela permet à Facebook de recevoir des informations sur votre visite sur nos Sites Web avec votre adresse IP. Si vous cliquez sur le bouton « J’aime » de Facebook pendant que vous êtes connecté à votre compte Facebook, vous pouvez lier le contenu de nos Sites Web à votre profil Facebook. Cela permet à Facebook d’attribuer votre visite à nos sites Web à votre compte d’utilisateur. Veuillez noter qu’en tant que fournisseur des Sites Web, nous ne recevons aucune notification concernant le contenu des données transmises ou leur utilisation par Facebook. Si vous ne souhaitez pas que Facebook attribue votre visite sur nos Sites Web à votre compte utilisateur Facebook, veuillez vous déconnecter de votre compte utilisateur Facebook.

Si vous vous connectez par le biais d’un Plugiciel de médias sociaux, vous nous autorisez à accéder à certaines informations de compte de ce site de médias sociaux, telles que votre profil public de médias sociaux (conformément à vos paramètres de confidentialité sur le site de médias sociaux), votre adresse courriel, vos centres d’intérêt, vos goûts, votre sexe, votre date d’anniversaire, vos antécédents en matière d’éducation, vos relations, votre ville actuelle, vos photos, votre description personnelle, votre liste d’amis, ainsi que les informations et les photos de vos amis de sites de médias sociaux qui pourraient être des amis communs de sites de médias sociaux avec d’autres utilisateurs. Les Plugiciels peuvent transférer des renseignements vous concernant sur la plateforme respective du Plugiciel sans que vous ayez à agir. Ces renseignements peuvent inclure votre numéro d’identification d’utilisateur de plateforme, le site Web sur lequel vous vous trouvez et plus encore. L’interaction avec un Plugiciel transmet des informations directement au réseau social de ce Plugiciel et ces informations peuvent être visibles par d’autres personnes sur cette plateforme. Les Plugiciels sont contrôlés par la politique de confidentialité du site de médias sociaux respectif (disponible sur leur site Web) et non par notre Politique de confidentialité.

3.2 PRESTATAIRES DE SERVICES, PARTENAIRES COMMERCIAUX ET SOUS-TRAITANTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Nous pouvons partager vos Renseignements personnels avec des Prestataires de services qui fournissent des services en notre nom, comme indiqué ci-dessus. Ces Prestataires de services peuvent avoir accès à vos Renseignements personnels afin de nous fournir ces services ou en notre nom. Si nous engageons des Prestataires de services pour l’une des activités susmentionnées, l’utilisation de vos Renseignements personnels sera liée à des obligations de confidentialité et leur utilisation des Renseignements personnels sera limitée à la prestation de leurs services pour nous. Nous pouvons stocker des Renseignements personnels dans des endroits hors de notre contrôle direct (par exemple, sur des serveurs ou des bases de données situés ou coimplantés avec des Prestataires de services d’hébergement de données).  

3.3 PUBLICITÉ COMPORTEMENTALE MULTICONTEXTE

Nous sommes tenus de divulguer si nous partageons des Renseignements personnels avec un tiers qui est engagé dans une publicité comportementale (ciblée) multicontexte. Au cours des douze (12) mois précédents, nous avons ou pouvons avoir divulgué les catégories suivantes de Renseignements personnels dans un contexte qui peut, en vertu de certaines lois (p. ex., la CPRA de la Californie, le RGPD ou le RGPD du Royaume-Uni) être considéré comme une vente :

* Identificateurs
* Internet ou autre activité réseau similaire
* Données de géolocalisation

Vous avez la possibilité de vous retirer de ce partage en cliquant sur les invites de désabonnement qui apparaîtront sur l’avis que vous recevez lorsque vous visitez nos applications mobiles ou nos Sites Web pour la première fois.

3.4 TRANSFERTS D’AFFAIRES
-------------------------

Vous reconnaissez (et ne vous y opposerez pas) que nous divulguons ou transférons vos Renseignements personnels, vos Renseignements personnels dépersonnalisés et les autres renseignements que vous nous fournissez, ainsi que les droits que vous avez accordés ou reconnus dans la présente Politique de confidentialité (collectivement, les « Renseignements transférés ») à un acheteur ou acquéreur potentiel ou réel de notre société ou à un autre successeur dans le but d’envisager ou de réaliser une fusion, cession, restructuration, réorganisation, dissolution, changement de contrôle ou transfert de tout ou partie de nos actifs (chacun de ces éléments étant désigné par le terme « Transfert »), que ce soit dans le cadre d’une poursuite d’activité ou d’une faillite, d’une liquidation ou de toute autre procédure judiciaire, dans laquelle les Renseignements personnels que nous détenons font partie des actifs transférés, et vous consentez à ne pas vous opposer à une telle divulgation ou à un tel transfert. Nous ne pouvons faire aucune déclaration concernant l’utilisation ou le transfert des Informations transférées que nous pourrions avoir en cas de faillite, de réorganisation, d’insolvabilité, de mise sous séquestre ou de cession au profit des créanciers. En outre, sauf si la loi l’exige, nous ne sommes pas et ne serons pas responsables de toute violation de la sécurité par des parties non affiliées ou de toute action de parties non affiliées qui reçoivent des Renseignements  transférés qui nous sont divulgués.

3.5 DIVULGATIONS REQUISES; PROTECTION DES DROITS; SÉCURITÉ
----------------------------------------------------------

Sauf indication contraire dans la présente Politique de confidentialité, nous ne divulguerons pas vos Renseignements personnels à une partie non affiliée, à moins que la loi, une ordonnance d’un tribunal ou une procédure judiciaire (par exemple, une assignation à comparaître) ne nous y oblige, y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, pour répondre à une demande d’un gouvernement, d’un organisme de réglementation ou d’une licence, ou si nous pensons qu’une telle action est nécessaire pour : (a) nous conformer à la loi, nous conformer aux procédures légales qui nous sont signifiées ou qui sont signifiées à nos sociétés affiliées, filiales, vendeurs sous contrat ou partenaires d’affinité, ou enquêter, prévenir ou prendre des mesures concernant des activités illégales suspectées ou réelles; (b) appliquer nos Conditions ou notre contrat client (y compris à des fins de facturation et de collecte); (c) prendre des précautions contre la responsabilité; (d) enquêter et nous défendre contre toute réclamation ou allégation de tiers; (e) aider les organismes d’application de la loi ou répondre aux exigences de sécurité nationales ou gouvernementales; (f) protéger la sécurité ou l’intégrité de nos Sites Web, de nos Services et de nos applications mobiles; ou (g) exercer ou protéger les droits, la propriété ou la sécurité personnelle de nous, de nos utilisateurs ou d’autres personnes. 

Nous tenterons de vous informer, dans la mesure du possible, de ces demandes, à moins que : (i) l’envoi d’un avis ne soit interdit par le processus légal lui-même, par une ordonnance du tribunal que nous recevons, ou par la loi applicable, ou (ii) nous estimions que l’envoi d’un avis serait futile, inefficace, créerait un risque de blessure ou de préjudice corporel ou autre pour un individu ou un groupe, ou créerait ou augmenterait un risque de fraude à notre égard, à l’égard de nos utilisateurs, de nos Sites Web, de nos Services ou de nos applications mobiles. Dans les cas où nous nous conformons à des demandes légales sans préavis pour ces raisons, nous tenterons d’informer cet utilisateur de la demande après coup si nous déterminons de bonne foi qu’il ne nous est plus légalement interdit de le faire et qu’aucun des scénarios de risque décrits dans ce paragraphe ne s’applique.

3.6 DIVULGATION DE RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS DÉPERSONNALISÉS
------------------------------------------------------------

Nous pouvons partager des Renseignements personnels dépersonnalisés (y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, les données d’utilisation anonymes, les pages et les URL de renvoi/sortie, les adresses IP, les types de plateforme, le nombre de clics, etc.) avec des parties non affiliées de la manière que nous choisissons et à quelque fin que ce soit, telle que pour l’administration du système et pour surveiller l’utilisation des Sites Web; pour mesurer le nombre de visites sur nos Sites Web, le temps moyen passé, le nombre de pages consultées; et pour surveiller diverses autres statistiques des Sites Web afin d’améliorer le contenu.

4\.  DEMANDE DE REFUS DE SUIVI
==============================

Certains navigateurs Web (y compris Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox et Chrome) intègrent une fonction de refus du suivi (Do Not Track, DNT) ou similaire qui signale aux sites Web qu’un utilisateur ne veut pas faire suivre son activité et son comportement en ligne. Si un site Web qui répond à un signal DNT particulier reçoit le signal DNT, le navigateur peut empêcher ce site Web de recueillir certaines informations sur l’utilisateur du navigateur. Les navigateurs n’offrent pas tous une option DNT et les signaux DNT ne sont pas encore uniformes. Pour cette raison, de nombreux exploitants de Sites Web, y compris PlugShare, ne répondent pas aux signaux DNT.

5\. COMMUNICATIONS, PRÉFÉRENCES ET RETRAIT DE PLUGSHARE
=======================================================

En nous fournissant votre adresse courriel, vous consentez à ce que nous utilisions cette adresse courriel pour vous envoyer des avis relatifs au Service par courriel, y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, tout avis requis par la loi (par exemple, avis de protection des données ou d’incidents de sécurité), au lieu de la communication par courrier. Vous acceptez également que nous puissions vous envoyer des notifications d’activité concernant nos Produits, Services, Sites Web, applications mobiles, vos Renseignements personnels ou tout autre aspect de notre relation, à l’adresse courriel que vous nous avez donnée, conformément aux paramètres de confidentialité applicables. Nous pouvons utiliser votre adresse courriel pour vous envoyer d’autres messages ou contenus, tels que, mais sans s’y limiter, des bulletins d’information, des ajouts ou des modifications aux fonctionnalités du Service, ou des offres spéciales. Si vous ne souhaitez pas recevoir de tels courriels, vous pouvez vous désabonner en cliquant sur « Se désabonner » lorsque cela est possible. Le refus peut vous empêcher de recevoir des courriels concernant des mises à jour, des améliorations, des fonctionnalités spéciales, des annonces ou des offres. Vous ne pouvez pas vous désabonner des courriels liés au Service. Si vous avez choisi de ne pas nous fournir une adresse courriel ou autre, vous pourriez ne pas recevoir nos courriels liés au Service.

Par le biais de la page des paramètres de votre compte utilisateur, vous pouvez accéder et, dans certains cas, modifier ou supprimer certaines informations que vous nous avez fournies, telles que le nom et le mot de passe, l’adresse courriel, l’adresse, les informations du profil utilisateur, etc. Les informations que vous pouvez consulter, mettre à jour et supprimer peuvent changer au fur et à mesure que les Produits, Sites Web, Services ou nos pratiques évoluent. Si vous avez des questions sur la consultation ou la mise à jour des informations que nous détenons sur vous, veuillez nous contacter. Toutefois, lorsque vous mettez à jour des informations, nous pouvons conserver une copie des informations non révisées dans nos dossiers. Vous pouvez demander la suppression de votre compte en nous envoyant un courriel. Il est de votre responsabilité de conserver votre adresse courriel actuelle avec nous. Selon l’État ou le pays dans lequel vous résidez, vous pouvez avoir des droits supplémentaires. Veuillez voir ci-dessous pour plus d’informations.

6\. DÉVELOPPEURS UTILISANT DES SERVICES DE PLATEFORME PLUGSHARE
===============================================================

Nous collaborons avec des tiers et leur permettons d’utiliser la plateforme de développeur PlugShare pour offrir des services et des fonctionnalités en conjonction avec PlugShare. Ces développeurs tiers ont négocié une entente pour utiliser la technologie de la plateforme PlugShare ou ont accepté nos interfaces de programmation d’applications en libre-service (« API ») et nos conditions de plugiciel afin de créer des applications de plateforme logicielle (« Applications de plateforme »). Les contrats négociés ainsi que les conditions d’utilisation de nos API et Plugiciels contiennent des restrictions sur la manière dont les tiers peuvent accéder, stocker et utiliser les renseignements personnels que vous fournissez à PlugShare. Si vous choisissez d’utiliser une Application de plateforme, il vous sera demandé de confirmer l’acceptation de la politique de confidentialité et du contrat d’utilisation du développeur tiers. Pour révoquer l’autorisation accordée à une Application de plateforme, veuillez consulter vos paramètres. Notez toutefois que même si vous révoquez l’autorisation accordée à une Application de plateforme, vos connexions peuvent toujours utiliser l’Application de plateforme, de sorte que l’Application de plateforme peut toujours avoir accès à certaines informations vous concernant, tout comme vos connexions.

7\. CONSERVATION DES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS
==============================================

La période pendant laquelle nous conservons vos Renseignements personnels dépend des fins pour lesquelles nous les utilisons. Nous conserverons vos Renseignements personnels aussi longtemps que votre compte sera actif, ou tant que vous êtes un titulaire de compte enregistré ou un utilisateur de nos Services ou aussi longtemps que nous avons un autre objectif commercial de le faire (comme mais sans s’y limiter, pour les affaires, taxes, ou à des fins juridiques) et, par la suite, pour une durée ne dépassant pas celle requise ou permise par la loi, ou notre politique de conservation des dossiers, raisonnablement nécessaire aux fins de rapports internes et de rapprochement, ou pour vous fournir des commentaires ou des renseignements que vous pourriez demander. Cette période de conservation est soumise à notre examen et à notre modification. Nous pouvons conserver les Renseignements personnels anonymisés aussi longtemps que nous le jugeons approprié.

À la suite de la résiliation ou de la désactivation de votre compte d’utilisateur, nous pouvons conserver les renseignements de votre profil et tous les renseignements affichés sur les zones publiques des Sites Web. À la suite de la résiliation ou de la désactivation de votre compte utilisateur, nous pouvons conserver vos Renseignements personnels et autres données, mais nous en assurerons la confidentialité conformément aux Conditions, à la présente Politique de confidentialité et aux exigences de la loi applicable. Nous avons le droit de supprimer tous vos Renseignements personnels et autres données après la résiliation de votre compte d’utilisateur sans préavis.

8\. AUCUNE COLLECTE INTENTIONNELLE DE DONNÉES D’ENFANTS
=======================================================

Nous ne recueillons, ne sollicitons ou ne conservons pas sciemment des Renseignements personnels de quiconque âgé de moins de 18 ans et nous ne permettons pas sciemment à ces personnes de s’inscrire ou d’utiliser nos Services. Si vous avez moins de 18 ans, veuillez ne pas nous envoyer de Renseignements personnels. Dans le cas où nous apprenons que nous avons recueilli des Renseignements personnels auprès d’un enfant de moins de 18 ans sans vérification du consentement parental, nous déploierons des efforts commercialement raisonnables pour supprimer ces renseignements de notre base de données.

9\. OÙ LES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS SONT TRAITÉS ET STOCKÉS; DROIT APPLICABLE
==============================================================================

Notre siège social est situé aux États-Unis. Les Renseignements personnels que nous ou nos Prestataires de services recueillons peuvent être stockés et traités sur des serveurs à l’intérieur ou à l’extérieur des États-Unis et partout où nous et nos Prestataires de services avons des installations dans le monde, et certains renseignements peuvent être accessibles par des personnes ou des entreprises à l’extérieur des États-Unis qui nous fournissent des services. Vous consentez à ce que nos Prestataires de services et nous-mêmes transmettions et/ou transférions vos Renseignements personnels à des juridictions, ou y accédions, qui peuvent ne pas offrir des niveaux de protection des données équivalents à ceux de votre juridiction d’origine. Nous prendrons des mesures raisonnables pour nous assurer que vos Renseignements personnels bénéficient d’un niveau de protection adéquat dans les juridictions où nous les traitons.

Les lois américaines s’appliquent dans la mesure où vous êtes un résident des États-Unis. Autrement, la présente Politique de confidentialité et toutes les autres questions doivent être interprétées conformément aux lois d’État, provinciales et fédérales de votre juridiction de résidence. Les juridictions à l’extérieur de votre lieu de résidence peuvent avoir des lois sur la protection de la vie privée différentes de celles de votre juridiction, y compris le droit des autorités policières et gouvernementales d’accéder aux Renseignements personnels.  Dans la mesure où nous traitons des données à l’extérieur de votre pays, nous entreprenons une évaluation de l’impact sur la confidentialité pour déterminer que nos Prestataires de services peuvent offrir sensiblement le même niveau de protection que celui requis dans votre juridiction et concluons des contrats pour renforcer davantage les obligations de traiter correctement vos Renseignements personnels.

10\. SÉCURITÉ
=============

Nous avons mis en place des mesures de sécurité techniques et organisationnelles conçues pour protéger vos Renseignements personnels contre la perte accidentelle et contre l’accès, l’utilisation, la destruction, l’altération et la divulgation non autorisés. Cependant, n’oubliez pas qu’Internet n’est pas un environnement entièrement sécurisé. Il est de votre responsabilité de protéger la sécurité de vos informations de connexion, de faire preuve de prudence lors de la transmission de tout Renseignement personnel par courriel, messagerie instantanée et autres moyens de communication similaires, et de maintenir de bonnes pratiques de sécurité sur Internet. Nous ne vous enverrons jamais de courriel pour vous demander votre mot de passe ou d’autres informations de connexion à votre compte. Si vous recevez un tel courriel, veuillez nous l’envoyer afin que nous puissions enquêter.

1.4 LES INFORMATIONS COLLECTÉES PAR LE BIAIS DE TECHNOLOGIES AUTOMATISÉES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lorsque vous naviguez et interagissez avec nos Services, nous pouvons également utiliser des technologies de collecte automatique de données pour collecter certaines informations à partir de votre appareil, navigateur ou d’autres activités réseau, comme décrit dans notre Politique relative aux cookies, disponible à l’adresse [https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html](https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html).

Visite du site Web et informations sur l’appareil. Nous recueillons des informations sur vos visites sur nos sites Web et l’utilisation de nos applications mobiles, y compris notamment les données de trafic, les données de géolocalisation, les journaux et autres données de communication et les ressources auxquelles vous accédez et que vous utilisez sur les sites Web. Nous collectons des informations sur votre ordinateur, votre appareil mobile et votre connexion Internet, y compris votre adresse IP, votre système d’exploitation, votre type de navigateur, vos habitudes de navigation (c.-à-d. ce sur quoi vous cliquez sur un site Web), l’URL du site Web le plus récent que vous avez visité avant de vous rendre sur nos sites Web, le temps que vous avez passé sur nos sites Web et les pages que vous avez consultées pendant que vous étiez sur nos sites Web. Nous pouvons obtenir une estimation approximative de votre localisation à partir de votre adresse IP lorsque vous visitez nos sites Web. Pour les utilisateurs de nos applications mobiles, nous pouvons également collecter et conserver un historique de vos informations de localisation précises à l’aide des technologies Wi-Fi ou Bluetooth, ainsi que des identifiants de votre appareil et des coordonnées GPS (par ex., latitude/longitude). Si vous souhaitez empêcher la collecte de vos informations de localisation, veuillez ajuster vos paramètres sur votre appareil mobile pour limiter l’accès de l’application mobile à vos informations de localisation.

Lorsque vous utilisez notre site Web, nous partageons les informations que nous recueillons auprès de vous, telles que votre adresse e-mail (sous forme hachée), votre adresse IP ou des informations sur votre navigateur ou votre système d'exploitation, avec nos partenaires d'identité/fournisseurs de services. Ces partenaires renvoient un code d'identification en ligne que nous pouvons stocker dans notre cookie propriétaire pour notre utilisation dans la publicité en ligne, intégrée à l'application et multicanal et il peut être partagé avec des sociétés de publicité pour permettre une publicité ciblée et basée sur les centres d'intérêt. Pour refuser cette utilisation, veuillez cliquer ici ([https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/)).

Suivi comportemental. Nous pouvons également utiliser ces technologies pour recueillir des informations sur vos activités en ligne au fil du temps et sur des sites Web tiers ou d’autres services en ligne, ou associer des Informations personnelles à d’autres informations recueillies de cette manière.

Analyse de la localisation : nos applications mobiles et nos sites Web de navigateur mobile comprennent des fonctionnalités (par ex., pour soumettre un avis du conducteur sur une installation de recharge) qui nous permettent d’identifier la localisation du conducteur et l’emplacement de l’installation de recharge où un utilisateur est actuellement situé. Nous collectons des informations telles que l’adresse IP, l’identifiant de l’appareil et la géolocalisation. Les utilisateurs de l’Application mobile peuvent choisir d’utiliser les Applications mobiles de manière anonyme ou de se connecter en tant qu’utilisateur identifié, auquel cas les données à caractère personnel fournies lors de l’inscription peuvent être utilisées.

Pour les utilisateurs des Applications mobiles, nous pouvons demander l’autorisation d’accéder à certaines informations à partir de votre appareil mobile, y compris votre liste de contacts, vos photos et vidéos, ainsi que votre microphone et votre appareil photo. Il est facultatif que vous nous donniez accès à ces informations. Cependant, certaines fonctionnalités des Applications mobiles peuvent ne pas fonctionner de manière optimale si vous décidez de ne pas nous donner votre autorisation.

Balises Web. Les pages de nos sites Web et de nos e-mails peuvent contenir de petits fichiers électroniques appelés balises Web (également appelés gifs transparents, balises pixel et gifs à pixel unique) qui nous permettent, par exemple, de compter les utilisateurs qui ont visité ces pages ou ouvert un e-mail et pour d’autres statistiques connexes du site Web (par exemple, enregistrer la popularité de certains contenus du site Web et vérifier l’intégrité du système et du serveur).

Suivi de pixels. En plus d’utiliser des cookies, les sites Web peuvent utiliser le « suivi de pixels ». Le suivi de pixels implique l’utilisation de balises pixel pour l’utilisateur et composés de quelques lignes de code informatique. Le suivi de pixels mesure l’efficacité des publicités et compile des statistiques d’utilisation agrégées et spécifiques. Nous pouvons accéder à ces balises pixel pour identifier l’activité et les intérêts qui peuvent nous permettre de mieux faire correspondre nos Produits, Services et offres à vos intérêts et besoins. Par exemple, si vous visitez nos sites Web à partir d’une publicité sur un autre site Web, la balise pixel permettra à l’annonceur de suivre que sa publicité vous a amené sur les sites Web. Si vous visitez nos sites Web et que nous vous renvoyons vers un autre site Web, nous pouvons également être en mesure de déterminer que vous avez été envoyé vers ou traité avec un site Web tiers.

GIF. Nous pouvons utiliser de minuscules images appelées GIF transparents pour suivre le comportement des utilisateurs, y compris des statistiques sur les personnes qui ouvrent nos e-mails.

Adresse IP. Nos serveurs (ou ceux de nos prestataires de services) enregistrent automatiquement certaines informations de fichier journal signalées par votre navigateur lorsque vous accédez aux sites Web. Ces journaux de serveur peuvent inclure des informations telles que les pages des sites Web que vous avez visitées, votre adresse de protocole Internet (« IP »), le type de navigateur et d’autres informations sur la manière dont vous interagissez avec les sites Web. Ces fichiers journaux sont généralement supprimés périodiquement.

Mesures et analyses tierces. Des mesures et analyses tierces, sur certaines pages ou fonctionnalités des Services pour nous aider à comprendre et analyser le trafic des visiteurs, mesurent l’efficacité promotionnelle et l’efficacité de nos fonctionnalités, offres et campagnes marketing. Nous utilisons également ces outils pour identifier les écueils, les lacunes et les domaines de nos opérations qui doivent être améliorés, et pour afficher la performance globale et le classement de notre présence en ligne. Ces outils peuvent stocker des cookies sur votre appareil à leur discrétion.

DÉCLARATION ET POLITIQUE EN MATIÈRE DE COOKIES

Différents types de cookies qui ont des finalités différentes sont utilisés sur nos sites Web.

Cookies essentiels

Les cookies de fonctionnalité nous permettent d’afficher des publicités adaptées à vos besoins sur nos Sites Web, de comprendre quelles parties de notre contenu vous intéressent le plus et quelles catégories de Produits ou de Services vous demandez. Certains de nos prestataires de services sont autorisés à placer des cookies sur nos sites Web. Ces sociétés peuvent également vous offrir la possibilité d’empêcher l’utilisation de cookies à l’avenir.

À tout moment, vous pouvez empêcher ou refuser l’utilisation future de certains cookies en activant le paramètre approprié dans votre navigateur pour refuser d’accepter les cookies du navigateur. Cependant, si vous le faites, votre expérience sur nos sites Web peut être affectée. Par exemple, vous pourriez ne pas être en mesure d’accéder à certaines parties de nos sites Web. À moins que vous n’ayez ajusté les paramètres de votre navigateur afin qu’il refuse les cookies, notre système émettra des cookies lorsque vous dirigerez votre navigateur vers nos sites Web.

Cookies de stockage local

Certaines fonctionnalités de nos sites Web peuvent utiliser des objets stockés localement (pour collecter et stocker des informations sur vos préférences et votre navigation vers, depuis et sur nos sites Web). Les cookies de stockage local ne sont pas gérés par les mêmes paramètres de navigateur que ceux utilisés pour les cookies de navigateur.

Par exemple, lorsque vous visitez nos sites Web, l’extension crée une connexion directe entre votre navigateur et le serveur Facebook. Cela permet à Facebook de recevoir des informations sur votre visite sur nos sites Web avec votre adresse IP. Si vous cliquez sur le bouton « J’aime » de Facebook alors que vous êtes connecté à votre compte Facebook, vous pouvez lier le contenu de nos sites Web à votre profil Facebook. Cela permet à Facebook d’attribuer votre visite sur nos sites Web à votre compte utilisateur. Veuillez noter qu’en tant que fournisseur des sites Web, nous ne recevons aucune notification concernant le contenu des données transmises ou leur utilisation par Facebook. Si vous ne souhaitez pas que Facebook attribue votre visite à nos sites Web à votre compte utilisateur Facebook, veuillez vous déconnecter de votre compte utilisateur Facebook.

Si vous vous connectez via une extension de réseau social, vous nous autorisez à accéder à certaines informations de compte à partir de ce site de réseaux sociaux, comme votre profil de réseau social public (conformément à vos paramètres de confidentialité sur le site de réseau social), votre adresse e-mail, vos intérêts, vos « j’aime », votre genre, votre anniversaire, votre historique de formation, vos relations, vos intérêts, votre ville actuelle, vos photos, votre description personnelle, votre liste d’amis, ainsi que des informations et des photos de vos amis sur les réseaux sociaux qui pourraient être des amis communs sur les réseaux sociaux avec d’autres utilisateurs. Les Extensions peuvent transférer des informations vous concernant vers la plateforme respective de l’Extension sans que vous n’agissiez. Ces informations peuvent inclure votre numéro d’identification d’utilisateur de plateforme, le site Web sur lequel vous vous trouvez, et plus encore. L’interaction avec une Extension transmettra des informations directement au réseau social de cette Extension et ces informations peuvent être visibles par d’autres personnes sur cette plateforme. Les Extensions sont contrôlés par la politique de confidentialité du site de réseaux sociaux concerné (disponible sur leur site Web), et non par notre Politique de confidentialité.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Nous pouvons partager vos Informations personnelles avec des Prestataires de services qui fournissent des services en notre nom, comme indiqué ci-dessus. Ces Prestataires de services peuvent avoir accès à vos Informations personnelles afin de nous fournir ces services ou en notre nom. Si nous engageons des Prestataires de services pour l’une des raisons susmentionnées, l’utilisation de vos Informations personnelles sera liée par des obligations de confidentialité et leur utilisation des Informations personnelles sera limitée à la fourniture de leurs services. Nous pouvons stocker des Informations à caractère personnel dans des endroits hors de notre contrôle direct (par exemple, sur des serveurs ou des bases de données situés ou co-localisés avec des Prestataires de services hébergeant des données).  

3.3 PUBLICITÉ COMPORTEMENTALE TRANSVERSALE
------------------------------------------

Nous sommes tenus de divulguer si nous partageons des Informations personnelles avec un tiers engagé dans une publicité comportementale (ciblée) transversale. Au cours des douze (12) mois précédents, nous avons ou pouvons avoir divulgué les catégories suivantes d’Informations personnelles dans un contexte qui peut, en vertu de certaines lois (par ex., CPRA de Californie, RGPD ou RGPD britannique) être considéré comme une vente :

* Identifiants
* Activité sur Internet ou autre réseau similaire
* Données de géolocalisation

Vous avez la possibilité de vous désinscrire de ce partage en cliquant sur les invites de désinscription qui apparaîtront sur l’avis que vous recevez lors de votre première visite de nos applications mobiles ou de nos sites Web.

3.4 TRANSFERTS D’ENTREPRISE
---------------------------

Vous reconnaissez (et ne vous opposerez pas) à notre divulgation ou transfert de vos Informations personnelles, de vos Informations personnelles anonymisées et d’autres informations que vous nous fournissez, ainsi que les droits que vous avez accordés ou reconnus dans la présente Politique de confidentialité (collectivement, « Informations transférées ») à un acheteur ou acquéreur potentiel ou réel de notre société ou tout autre successeur dans le but d’envisager ou de réaliser une fusion, une cession, une restructuration, une réorganisation, une dissolution, un changement de contrôle ou le transfert de tout ou partie de nos actifs (chacun des éléments ci-dessus étant dénommé un « Transfert »), que ce soit dans le cadre d’une activité ou d’une faillite, d’une liquidation ou de toute autre procédure judiciaire, dans laquelle les Informations personnelles que nous détenons font partie des actifs transférés, et vous acceptez de ne pas vous opposer à une telle divulgation ou transfert. Nous ne pouvons faire aucune déclaration concernant l’utilisation ou le transfert des Informations transférées que nous pouvons avoir en cas de faillite, de réorganisation, d’insolvabilité, de redressement judiciaire ou de cession au profit des créanciers. En outre, sauf si la loi l’exige, nous ne sommes pas et ne serons pas responsables de toute violation de la sécurité par des parties non affiliées ou de toute action de parties non affiliées qui reçoivent l’une quelconque des Informations transférées qui nous est divulguée.

3.5 DIVULGATIONS REQUISES, PROTECTION DES DROITS ET SÉCURITÉ
------------------------------------------------------------

Sauf indication contraire dans la présente Politique de confidentialité, nous ne divulguerons pas vos Informations personnelles à une partie non affiliée, sauf si la loi, une ordonnance du tribunal ou une procédure judiciaire (par ex., assignation à comparaître) l’exige, y compris notamment afin de répondre à toute demande gouvernementale, réglementaire ou de licence, ou si nous pensons qu'une telle action est nécessaire pour : (a) se conformer à la loi, se conformer aux procédures judiciaires qui nous sont signifiées ou qui sont signifiées à nos sociétés affiliées, filiales, fournisseurs sous contrat, ou partenaires d’affinité, ou pour enquêter, prévenir, ou prendre des mesures concernant des activités illégales présumées ou réelles ; (b) faire appliquer nos Conditions ou notre accord client (y compris à des fins de facturation et de recouvrement) ; (c) prendre des précautions contre toute responsabilité ; (d) enquêter et nous défendre contre toute réclamation ou allégation de tiers ; (e) aider les organismes gouvernementaux chargés de l’application des lois ou répondre aux exigences de sécurité nationales ou autres ; (f) pour protéger la sécurité ou l’intégrité de nos Sites Web, de nos Services et des applications mobiles ; ou, (g) exercer ou protéger nos droits, nos biens, notre sécurité personnelle ou ceux de nos utilisateurs ou d’autres personnes. 

Nous tenterons de vous informer, lorsque cela est possible, de ces demandes, sauf si : (i) la notification est interdite par la procédure judiciaire elle-même, par une ordonnance du tribunal que nous recevons, ou par la loi applicable, ou (ii) nous pensons que la notification serait futile, inefficace, créerait un risque de blessure ou de dommage corporel ou autre pour une personne ou un groupe, ou créerait ou augmenterait un risque de fraude pour nous, nos utilisateurs, nos sites Web, nos services ou nos applications mobiles. Dans les cas où nous nous conformons à des demandes légales sans préavis pour ces raisons, nous tenterons d’informer cet utilisateur de la demande après le fait si nous déterminons de bonne foi que nous ne sommes plus légalement interdits de le faire et qu’aucun scénario de risque décrit dans ce paragraphe ne s’applique.

3.6 DIVULGATION D’INFORMATIONS PERSONNELLES DÉSIDENTIFIÉES
----------------------------------------------------------

Nous pouvons partager des Informations personnelles désidentifiées (y compris notamment des données d’utilisation anonymes, des pages et URL de référence/sortie, une adresse IP, des types de plateforme, le nombre de clics, etc.) avec des parties non affiliées de quelque manière que ce soit et à quelque fin que ce soit, comme pour l’administration du système et pour surveiller l’utilisation des Sites Web, pour mesurer le nombre de visites sur nos Sites Web, le temps moyen passé, le nombre de pages consultées et pour surveiller diverses autres statistiques du Site Web afin d’améliorer le contenu.

4\.  DEMANDES « NE PAS SUIVRE »
===============================

Certains navigateurs Web (y compris Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox et Chrome) intègrent une fonctionnalité « Ne pas suivre » (Do Not Track, « DNT ») ou similaire qui signale aux sites Web qu’un utilisateur ne souhaite pas que son activité et son comportement en ligne soient suivis. Si un site Web qui répond à un signal DNT particulier reçoit le signal DNT, le navigateur peut empêcher ce site Web de collecter certaines informations sur l’utilisateur du navigateur. Tous les navigateurs n’offrent pas une option DNT et les signaux DNT ne sont pas encore uniformes. Pour cette raison, de nombreux opérateurs de sites Web, y compris PlugShare, ne répondent pas aux signaux DNT.

5\. COMMUNICATIONS PLUGSHARE, PRÉFÉRENCES ET DÉSINSCRIPTION
===========================================================

En nous fournissant votre adresse e-mail, vous consentez à ce que nous utilisions l’adresse e-mail pour vous envoyer des notifications liées au Service par e-mail, y compris notamment toute notification requise par la loi (par ex., notification d’incidents de confidentialité ou de sécurité des données), au lieu d’une communication par courrier postal. Vous acceptez également que nous puissions vous envoyer des notifications d’activité concernant nos Produits, Services, les Sites Web, les applications mobiles, vos Informations personnelles ou tout aspect de notre relation, à l’adresse e-mail que vous nous fournissez, conformément à tous les paramètres de confidentialité applicables. Nous pouvons utiliser votre adresse e-mail pour vous envoyer d’autres messages ou contenus, tels que, mais sans s’y limiter, des newsletters, des ajouts ou des modifications aux fonctionnalités du Service, ou des offres particulières. Si vous ne souhaitez pas recevoir ces e-mails, vous pouvez vous désabonner en cliquant sur Se désabonner, le cas échéant. Le fait de vous désinscrire peut vous empêcher de recevoir des e-mails concernant des mises à jour, des améliorations, des fonctionnalités particulières, des annonces ou des offres. Vous ne pouvez pas refuser les e-mails liés au Service. Si vous avez choisi de ne pas nous fournir d’e-mail ou d’autre adresse, il se peut que vous ne receviez pas nos e-mails liés au Service.

Sur la page des paramètres de votre compte utilisateur, vous pouvez accéder à certaines informations que vous nous avez fournies et, dans certains cas, les modifier ou les supprimer, telles que le nom et le mot de passe, l’adresse e-mail, l’adresse, les informations de profil utilisateur, etc. Les informations que vous pouvez consulter, mettre à jour et supprimer peuvent changer à mesure que les Produits, les Sites Web, les Services ou nos pratiques changent. Si vous avez des questions concernant la consultation ou la mise à jour des informations que nous avons sur vous, veuillez nous contacter. Cependant, lorsque vous mettez à jour des informations, nous pouvons conserver une copie des informations non révisées dans nos dossiers. Vous pouvez demander la suppression de votre compte en nous envoyant un e-mail. Il est de votre responsabilité de tenir à jour votre adresse e-mail avec nous. En fonction de l’État ou du pays dans lequel vous résidez, vous pouvez avoir des droits supplémentaires. Veuillez consulter ci-dessous pour plus d’informations.

6\. DÉVELOPPEURS UTILISANT DES SERVICES DE PLATEFORME PLUGSHARE
===============================================================

Nous collaborons avec des tiers et leur permettons d’utiliser la plateforme de développement de PlugShare pour offrir des services et des fonctionnalités en conjonction avec PlugShare. Ces développeurs tiers ont soit négocié un accord pour utiliser la technologie de plateforme PlugShare, soit accepté nos Interfaces de programmation d’application (Application Programming Interfaces, « API ») et Extensions en libre-service afin de créer des applications de plateforme logicielle (les « Applications de plateforme »). Les accords négociés et nos conditions d’utilisation de l’API et des Extensions contiennent des restrictions sur la manière dont les tiers peuvent accéder, stocker et utiliser les Informations personnelles que vous fournissez à PlugShare. Si vous choisissez d’utiliser une Application de plateforme, il vous sera demandé de confirmer l’acceptation de la politique de confidentialité et de l’accord utilisateur du développeur tiers. Pour révoquer l’autorisation accordée à une Application de plateforme, veuillez consulter vos paramètres. Notez toutefois que même si vous révoquez l’autorisation accordée à une Application de plateforme, vos connexions peuvent toujours utiliser l’Application de plateforme, de sorte que l’Application de plateforme peut toujours avoir accès à certaines informations vous concernant, tout comme vos connexions.

7\. CONSERVATION DES INFORMATIONS PERSONNELLES
==============================================

La période pendant laquelle nous conservons vos Informations personnelles dépend des finalités pour lesquelles nous les utilisons. Nous conserverons vos Informations personnelles aussi longtemps que votre compte sera actif, ou tant que vous êtes titulaire d’un compte enregistré ou utilisateur de nos Services, ou aussi longtemps que nous avons une autre finalité commerciale pour le faire (comme, notamment, à des fins professionnelles, fiscales ou juridiques) et, par la suite, pour une durée n’excédant pas celle requise ou autorisée par la loi, ou notre politique de conservation des dossiers, raisonnablement nécessaire à des fins de rapport interne et de rapprochement, ou pour vous fournir des commentaires ou des informations que vous pourriez demander. Cette période de conservation est soumise à notre examen et à notre modification. Nous pouvons conserver les Informations personnelles désidentifiées aussi longtemps que nous le jugeons approprié.

Après la résiliation ou la désactivation de votre compte utilisateur, nous pouvons conserver vos informations de profil et toutes les informations publiées sur les espaces publics des sites Web. Après la résiliation ou la désactivation de votre compte utilisateur, nous pouvons conserver vos Informations personnelles et d’autres données, mais nous les conserverons de manière confidentielle conformément aux Conditions, à la présente Politique de confidentialité et à la loi applicable. Nous avons le droit de supprimer toutes vos Informations personnelles et autres données après la résiliation de votre compte utilisateur sans préavis.

8\. PAS DE COLLECTE INTENTIONNELLE DE DONNÉES SUR LES ENFANTS
=============================================================

Nous ne collectons, ne sollicitons ou ne conservons pas sciemment les Informations personnelles de toute personne âgée de moins de 18 ans et nous n’autorisons pas sciemment ces personnes à s’inscrire à nos Services ou à les utiliser. Si vous avez moins de 18 ans, veuillez ne pas nous envoyer d’Informations personnelles. Si nous apprenons que nous avons recueilli des Informations personnelles auprès d’un enfant de moins de 18 ans sans vérification du consentement parental, nous déploierons des efforts commercialement raisonnables pour supprimer ces informations de notre base de données.

9\. OÙ LES INFORMATIONS PERSONNELLES SONT TRAITÉES ET STOCKÉES ET DROIT APPLICABLE
==================================================================================

Nous avons notre siège social aux États-Unis. Les Informations personnelles que nous ou nos Prestataires de services collectons peuvent être stockées et traitées sur des serveurs à l’intérieur ou à l’extérieur des États-Unis et partout où nous et nos Prestataires de services avons des installations dans le monde, et certaines informations peuvent être accessibles par des personnes ou des sociétés en dehors des États-Unis qui nous fournissent des services. Vous consentez à la transmission ou au transfert de vos Informations personnelles par nos Prestataires de services vers, ou à leur accès dans, des pays qui peuvent ne pas fournir des niveaux de protection des données équivalents à ceux de votre pays d’origine. Nous prendrons des mesures raisonnables pour nous assurer que vos Informations personnelles bénéficient d’un niveau de protection adéquat dans les pays dans lesquels nous les traitons.

Les lois américaines s’appliquent dans la mesure où vous résidez aux États-Unis. Dans le cas contraire, la présente Politique de confidentialité et toutes les autres questions seront interprétées conformément aux lois provinciales/étatiques et fédérales du pays dans lequel vous résidez. Les pays en dehors de votre résidence peuvent avoir des lois sur la protection de la vie privée différentes de celles de votre pays, y compris le droit des forces de l’ordre et des autorités gouvernementales d’accéder aux Informations personnelles.  Dans la mesure où nous traitons des données en dehors de votre pays, nous effectuons une analyse d’impact relative à la protection des données afin de déterminer que nos Prestataires de services peuvent offrir sensiblement le même niveau de protection que celui requis dans votre pays et conclure des contrats pour renforcer davantage les obligations de traitement approprié de vos Informations personnelles.

10\. SÉCURITÉ
=============

Nous avons mis en place des mesures de sécurité techniques et organisationnelles conçues pour protéger vos Informations personnelles contre la perte accidentelle et contre l’accès, l’utilisation, la destruction, la modification et la divulgation non autorisés. Cependant, veuillez garder à l’esprit qu’Internet n’est pas un environnement 100 % sécurisé. Il est de votre responsabilité de protéger la sécurité de vos informations de connexion, de faire preuve de prudence lors de la transmission de toute information personnelle par e-mail, messagerie instantanée et autres moyens de communication similaires, et de maintenir de bonnes pratiques de sécurité Internet. Nous ne vous enverrons jamais d’e-mail pour vous demander votre mot de passe ou d’autres informations de connexion au compte. Si vous recevez un tel e-mail, veuillez nous l’envoyer afin que nous puissions enquêter.

Si vous résidez en Californie, en Virginie, dans le Colorado, dans l’Utah ou dans le Connecticut (parfois appelé « Consommateur »), les lois de l’État vous accordent des droits supplémentaires concernant notre utilisation de vos Informations personnelles.

LOI CALIFORNIENNE « SHINE THE LIGHT »
-------------------------------------

La section 1798.83 du Code civil de Californie, connue sous le nom de loi « Shine The Light », permet à tous les utilisateurs résidant en Californie de demander et d’obtenir de notre part une liste des Informations personnelles (le cas échéant) que nous avons divulguées à des tiers à des fins de marketing direct au cours de l’année civile précédente, ainsi que les noms et adresses de ces tiers. Les demandes ne peuvent être faites qu’une fois par an et sont gratuites.

CalOPPA s’applique uniquement aux sociétés qui collectent des Informations personnelles des résidents de Californie.

1. COMMENT NOUS RÉAGISSONS AUX SIGNAUX « NE PAS SUIVRE ».

Certains navigateurs web transmettent des signaux « ne pas suivre » (Do Not Track, DNT/Global Privacy Control, GPC) aux sites web et à d’autres services en ligne avec lesquels votre navigateur web communique. Actuellement, il n’existe aucune norme régissant ce que les sites web doivent faire, le cas échéant, lorsqu’ils reçoivent ces signaux. Toutefois, nous disposons actuellement de mesures pour réagir en réponse à ces signaux.

2. SUIVI COMPORTEMENTAL TIERS

Nous pouvons également utiliser ces technologies pour recueillir des informations sur vos activités en ligne au fil du temps et sur des sites Web tiers ou d’autres services en ligne, ou associer des Informations personnelles à d’autres informations recueillies de cette manière. Nous pouvons utiliser les Informations personnelles pour suivre les clics et les habitudes de navigation des utilisateurs.

Vous avez le droit de refuser de vendre ou de concéder sous licence ces catégories d’informations personnelles vous concernant à des parties non affiliées.

EXERCICE DES DROITS
-------------------

Pour exercer les droits d’accès, de correction, de portabilité des données et de suppression décrits ci-dessus, veuillez nous soumettre une demande par le biais de notre formulaire en ligne disponible [ici](https://company.plugshare.com/privacy-notice.html#data-form). Seulement vous ou une personne que vous autorisez à agir en votre nom pouvez faire une demande liée à vos Informations personnelles. Vous pouvez également faire une demande au nom de votre enfant mineur. Si nous recevons une demande d’une personne d’exercer vos droits en votre nom, nous demanderons une copie du document signé donnant l’autorisation de soumettre une telle demande en votre nom et nous vous contacterons directement pour confirmer cette autorisation. Vous ne pouvez faire une demande d’accès ou de portabilité des données que deux fois au cours d’une période de 12 mois. La demande du Consommateur vérifiable doit :

* Fournir suffisamment d’informations qui nous permettent de vérifier raisonnablement que vous êtes la personne au sujet de laquelle nous avons recueilli des Informations personnelles ou qu’un représentant autorisé a fait la demande.
* Décrire votre demande avec suffisamment de détails pour nous permettre de la comprendre, de l’évaluer et d’y répondre correctement.

Nous ne pouvons pas répondre à votre demande ou vous fournir des Informations personnelles si nous ne pouvons pas vérifier votre identité ou votre autorité pour faire la demande et confirmer que les Informations personnelles vous concernent. Faire une demande ne vous oblige pas à créer un compte chez nous. Nous n’utiliserons les Informations personnelles fournies dans une demande que pour vérifier l’identité ou l’autorité du demandeur à faire la demande.

Pour exercer les droits de refuser la publicité comportementale ou ciblée transversale, ou le partage d’Informations personnelles tel que décrit ci-dessus, vous devrez vous désinscrire en fonction de la plateforme sur laquelle vous êtes.  Veuillez noter que votre demande de désinscription est spécifique à l’appareil ou à la plateforme à partir desquels vous soumettez cette demande. Vous devrez donc soumettre plusieurs demandes si vous souhaitez refuser ces activités de traitement spécifiques pour plusieurs appareils et plateformes. Veuillez cliquer :

* [ici pour vous désinscrire de Plugshare.com (plateforme web)](#)
* [ici pour vous désinscrire de l’application Plugshare pour iOS](plugshare://ad-preferences)
* [ici pour vous désinscrire de l’application Plugshare pour Android](plugshare://ad-preferences)

### Processus de vérification

Dès réception d’une demande d’accès aux données, de leur correction, de leur portabilité ou de leur suppression de votre part, nous vous enverrons un e-mail dans les 10 jours ouvrables à l’adresse e-mail que nous avons pour vous. L’e-mail vous demandera de répondre pour vérifier que vous êtes le Consommateur qui fait la demande.

Gli utenti possono scegliere di utilizzare solo la propria e-mail e password per navigare sui caricabatterie domestici. Gli utenti possono anche scegliere di sfruttare le funzionalità avanzate postando, commentando, pubblicando o condividendo ulteriori dati personali con la comunità. In generale, gli utenti scelgono quante informazioni desiderano visualizzare su se stessi e possono scegliere di non partecipare in qualsiasi momento.

1.4 INFORMAZIONI RACCOLTE ATTRAVERSO TECNOLOGIE AUTOMATIZZATE
-------------------------------------------------------------

Mentre l’utente naviga e interagisce con i nostri Servizi, possiamo anche utilizzare tecnologie di raccolta automatica dei dati per raccogliere determinate informazioni dal suo dispositivo, browser o altre attività di rete come descritto nella nostra Informativa sui cookie, disponibile all’indirizzo [https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html](https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html).

Visita al sito web e informazioni sul dispositivo. Raccogliamo i dettagli delle visite dell’utente ai nostri Siti web e dell’uso delle nostre App mobili, inclusi, a titolo esemplificativo ma non esaustivo, dati sul traffico, dati di geolocalizzazione, registri e altri dati di comunicazione e le risorse a cui l’utente accede e che utilizza sui Siti web. Raccogliamo informazioni sul computer, sul dispositivo mobile e sulla connessione a Internet dell’utente, tra cui l’indirizzo IP, il sistema operativo, il tipo di browser, i modelli di clickstream (ovvero, su cosa clicca su un sito web), l’URL del sito web più recente visitato prima di accedere ai nostri Siti web, la quantità di tempo che l’utente ha trascorso sui nostri Siti web e le pagine visualizzate durante la visita ai nostri Siti web. Possiamo ricavare una stima approssimativa della posizione dell’utente dal suo indirizzo IP quando visita i nostri Siti web. Per gli utenti delle nostre App mobili, possiamo anche raccogliere e mantenere una cronologia delle loro informazioni precise sulla posizione utilizzando tecnologie Wi-Fi e/o Bluetooth, nonché gli identificativi del loro dispositivo e le coordinate GPS (ad es. latitudine/longitudine). Se l’utente desidera impedire la raccolta delle informazioni sulla sua posizione, deve modificare le impostazioni nel suo dispositivo mobile per limitare l’accesso dell’App mobile alle informazioni sulla posizione.

Quando utilizzi il nostro sito Web, condividiamo le informazioni che raccogliamo da te, come la tua e-mail (in formato hash), l'indirizzo IP o le informazioni sul tuo browser o sistema operativo, con i nostri partner di identità/fornitori di servizi. Questi partner restituiscono un codice di identificazione online che possiamo memorizzare nel nostro cookie di prima parte per il nostro utilizzo nella pubblicità online, in-app e multicanale e può essere condiviso con società pubblicitarie per consentire pubblicità mirata e basata sugli interessi. Per negare il consenso a questo utilizzo, fare clic qui ([https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/)).

Monitoraggio comportamentale. Possiamo anche utilizzare queste tecnologie per raccogliere informazioni sulle attività online dell’utente nel tempo e su siti web di terze parti o altri servizi online, o associare i dati personali dell’utente ad altre informazioni raccolte in questo modo.

Analisi della posizione: le nostre App mobili e i Siti web del browser mobile includono funzionalità (ad es., per l’invio di una revisione di un conducente di una stazione di ricarica) che ci consentono di identificare la posizione di un conducente e la posizione della stazione di ricarica in cui si trova attualmente un utente. Raccogliamo informazioni quali indirizzo IP, ID del dispositivo e geolocalizzazione. Gli utenti dell’App mobile possono scegliere di utilizzare le App mobili in forma anonima o di accedere come utente identificato, nel qual caso possono essere utilizzati i dati personali forniti al momento della registrazione.

Per gli utenti delle App mobili, potremmo chiedere l’autorizzazione ad accedere a determinate informazioni dal dispositivo mobile dell’utente, tra cui l’elenco dei contatti, le foto e i video, il microfono e la fotocamera. È facoltativo che l’utente ci fornisca l’accesso a tali informazioni. Tuttavia, in caso contrario alcune funzionalità delle App mobili potrebbero non funzionare in modo ottimale.

Le pagine dei nostri Siti web e delle nostre e-mail possono contenere piccoli file elettronici noti come web beacon (chiamati anche clear gif, pixel tag e single pixel gif) che ci consentono, ad esempio, di contare gli utenti che hanno visitato tali pagine o aperto un’e-mail e per altre statistiche correlate al sito web (ad es., registrando la popolarità di determinati contenuti del sito web e verificando l’integrità del sistema e del server).

Tracciamento dei pixel. Oltre a utilizzare i cookie, i Siti web possono utilizzare il “tracciamento dei pixel”. Il tracciamento dei pixel prevede l’uso di pixel tag non visibili all’utente e costituiti da alcune righe di codice del computer. Il tracciamento dei pixel misura l’efficacia degli annunci pubblicitari e compila statistiche di utilizzo aggregate e specifiche. Possiamo accedere a questi pixel tag per identificare attività e interessi che possono consentirci di abbinare meglio i nostri Prodotti, Servizi e offerte agli interessi e alle esigenze dell’utente. Ad esempio, se l’utente visita i nostri Siti web da una pubblicità su un altro sito web, il pixel tag consentirà all’inserzionista di tenere traccia che la sua pubblicità ha portato l’utente sui Siti web. Se l’utente visita i nostri Siti web e noi lo colleghiamo a un altro sito web, potremmo anche essere in grado di determinare che l’utente è stato inviato e/o collegato a un sito web di terze parti.

GIF. Possiamo utilizzare minuscole immagini note come GIF trasparenti per monitorare il comportamento degli utenti, comprese le statistiche su chi apre le nostre e-mail.

Indirizzo IP. I nostri server (o quelli dei nostri fornitori di servizi) registrano automaticamente determinate informazioni sui file di registro riportate dal browser dell’utente quando accede ai Siti web. Questi registri del server possono includere informazioni quali le pagine dei Siti web visitati, l’indirizzo del protocollo Internet (“IP”), il tipo di browser e altre informazioni su come l’utente interagisce con i Siti web. Questi file di registro vengono generalmente eliminati periodicamente.

Metriche e analisi di terze parti. Metriche e analisi di terze parti, su determinate pagine o caratteristiche dei Servizi per aiutarci a comprendere e analizzare il traffico dei visitatori, misurare l’efficacia promozionale e l’efficacia delle nostre caratteristiche, offerte e campagne di marketing. Utilizziamo questi strumenti anche per identificare lacune, carenze e aree delle nostre operazioni che necessitano di miglioramenti, e per visualizzare le prestazioni complessive e la classificazione della nostra presenza online. Questi strumenti possono memorizzare cookie sul dispositivo dell’utente a loro discrezione.

INFORMATIVA E POLITICA SUI COOKIE

Le tecnologie che utilizziamo per la raccolta automatica dei dati includono anche i cookie, come descritto di seguito.

Cookie del browser

I cookie del browser sono piccoli file collocati sul disco rigido del computer o del dispositivo mobile dell’utente. Possono contenere determinati dati, tra cui, a titolo esemplificativo ma non esaustivo, il nome del server che lo ha inserito, un identificativo sotto forma di numero univoco e una data di scadenza (solo alcuni cookie). I cookie del browser sono gestiti dal browser web (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, ecc.) sul computer o sul dispositivo mobile dell’utente. I nostri Siti web utilizzano diverse tipologie di cookie che hanno scopi diversi.

Cookie essenziali

I cookie essenziali sono necessari per consentire all’utente di navigare nei nostri Siti web e utilizzarne le funzioni. Senza di essi, servizi come il carrello degli acquisti e la fatturazione elettronica non potrebbero funzionare.

Cookie di prestazione

I cookie di prestazione raccolgono informazioni sull’uso dei nostri Siti web, ad esempio quali pagine vengono consultate più spesso. Queste informazioni ci consentono di ottimizzare i nostri Siti web e semplificare la navigazione. I cookie di prestazione consentono inoltre ai nostri affiliati e partner di scoprire se l’utente ha effettuato l’accesso a una delle pagine del nostro Sito web dal loro sito e se la sua visita ha portato all’uso o all’acquisto di un Prodotto o Servizio dai nostri Siti web, compresi i riferimenti per il Prodotto o Servizio acquistato. Tutte le informazioni raccolte dai cookie di prestazione sono aggregate e, quindi, anonime.

Cookie di funzionalità

I cookie di funzionalità consentono ai nostri Siti web di ricordare le scelte effettuate durante la navigazione. Ad esempio, possiamo memorizzare la posizione geografica dell’utente in un cookie in modo che vengano visualizzati i Siti web corrispondenti alla sua area. Possiamo anche ricordare le preferenze dell’utente, come la dimensione del testo, il carattere e altri aspetti personalizzabili dei Siti web. I cookie di funzionalità possono anche essere in grado di tenere traccia dei prodotti o dei video consultati per evitare ripetizioni. Le informazioni raccolte da questi cookie non possono essere utilizzate per identificare l’utente e non possono monitorare la sua attività di navigazione su siti web che non appartengono a noi. I cookie di funzionalità ci consentono di visualizzare pubblicità su misura per l’utente sui nostri Siti web, per comprendere quali parti dei nostri contenuti sono più interessanti per l’utente e quali categorie di Prodotti o Servizi richiede. Alcuni dei nostri fornitori di servizi sono autorizzati a inserire cookie sui nostri Siti web. Tali società possono inoltre fornire all’utente la possibilità di impedire l’uso dei cookie in futuro.

In qualsiasi momento, l’utente può impedire o rifiutare l’uso futuro di alcuni cookie attivando l’impostazione appropriata nel browser per rifiutare di accettare i cookie del browser. Tuttavia, in tal caso, l’esperienza dell’utente sui nostri Siti web potrebbe risentirne; ad esempio, l’utente potrebbe non essere in grado di accedere a determinate parti dei nostri Siti web. A meno che l’utente non abbia modificato le impostazioni del browser in modo che rifiuti i cookie, il nostro sistema collocherà i cookie quando l’utente indirizza il browser ai nostri Siti web.

Cookie di archiviazione locale

Alcune funzionalità dei nostri Siti web possono utilizzare oggetti memorizzati localmente (per raccogliere e memorizzare informazioni sulle preferenze e sulla navigazione dell’utente verso, da e sui nostri Siti web. I cookie di archiviazione locale non sono gestiti dalle stesse impostazioni del browser utilizzate per i cookie del browser.

Possiamo anche combinare i dati personali che raccogliamo dall’utente al di fuori dei nostri Siti web o Servizi con quelli che vengono raccolti attraverso i nostri Siti web o Servizi o con altri mezzi come descritto sopra.

1.5 INFORMAZIONI SUL DISPOSITIVO, SULLA RETE, SULLA GEOLOCALIZZAZIONE E SUL VEICOLO ELETTRICO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quando l’utente visita o esce dai nostri Siti web o Servizi facendo clic su un collegamento ipertestuale o visualizzando un plug-in su un sito web di terze parti, riceviamo automaticamente l’URL del sito da cui proviene l’utente o quello a cui viene indirizzato. Inoltre, gli inserzionisti ricevono l’URL della pagina su cui si trova quando l’utente fa clic su qualsiasi annuncio che potrebbe apparire sui nostri Servizi. Riceviamo anche l’indirizzo del protocollo Internet (“IP”) del computer dell’utente o del server proxy che utilizza per accedere a Internet, i dettagli del sistema operativo del suo computer, il tipo di browser Web, il dispositivo mobile (incluso l’identificativo del dispositivo mobile fornito dal sistema operativo del dispositivo mobile), il sistema operativo mobile (se si accede ai nostri siti Web o servizi utilizzando un dispositivo mobile) e il nome dell’ISP dell’utente o del suo gestore di telefonia mobile.

1.6 SONDAGGI
------------

Noi o terze parti non affiliate possiamo condurre sondaggi sugli utenti in merito ai nostri Servizi. Alcune terze parti non affiliate possono indirizzare all’utente pubblicità o promozioni in base alle sue risposte ai sondaggi. Noi o le parti parti non affiliate sviluppiamo nuovi programmi o prodotti in base alle informazioni che l’utente condivide nei sondaggi. Possiamo utilizzare terze parti non affiliate per fornire incentivi finanziari o di altro tipo all’utente per partecipare ai sondaggi. Se l’erogazione degli incentivi richiede le informazioni di contatto dell’utente, all’utente potrebbe essere chiesto di fornire gli stessi alla terza parte non affiliata che realizza l’offerta di incentivi; le quali informazioni saranno utilizzate solo allo scopo di fornire gli incentivi promessi e verificare le informazioni di contatto dell’utente. Spetta all’utente decidere se fornire tali informazioni o se desidera approfittare di un’offerta di incentivi. Il consenso dell’utente all’uso di qualsiasi dato personale per le finalità stabilite nel sondaggio sarà esplicitamente richiesto dalla terza parte non affiliata che lo conduce. Per scegliere di non partecipare ai nostri sondaggi, l’utente può inviarci la sua richiesta utilizzando le informazioni di contatto riportate di seguito.

2\. NATURA E FINALITÀ DEL TRATTAMENTO DEI DATI PERSONALI
========================================================

Utilizziamo le informazioni che raccogliamo sull’utente o che l’utente ci fornisce, compresi ii dati personali, per uno o più delle seguenti finalità:

* Presentare i nostri Siti web e le applicazioni mobili e i relativi contenuti all’utente.

* In qualsiasi altro modo possiamo descrivere e per cui otteniamo il consenso dell’utente quando fornisce le informazioni.

Utilizziamo cookie, clear gif e informazioni sui file di log per: (a) ricordare le informazioni in modo che l'utente non debba reinserirle durante la visita o la volta successiva che visita i Siti web; (b) fornire contenuti e informazioni personalizzati; (c) monitorare l'efficacia dei nostri Servizi; (d) monitorare le metriche aggregate come il numero totale di visitatori, il traffico e i modelli demografici; (e) diagnosticare o risolvere i problemi tecnologici segnalati dai nostri utenti o tecnici che sono associati a determinati indirizzi IP; e/o (f) aiutare l'utente ad accedere in modo efficiente alle proprie informazioni dopo l'accesso.

I dati statistici che raccogliamo automaticamente ci aiutano a migliorare i nostri Siti web e a fornire Prodotti e Servizi migliori e più personalizzati, tra cui, a titolo esemplificativo ma non esaustivo, consentendoci di: stimare le dimensioni del nostro pubblico/visitatore e i modelli di utilizzo, memorizzare informazioni sulle preferenze dell’utente, consentirci di personalizzare e migliorare i nostri Siti web, accelerare le ricerche e/o riconoscere l’utente quando torna ai nostri Siti web.

Possiamo raccogliere e utilizzare le informazioni della sessione di ricarica del veicolo elettronico dell’utente (ad es., tempo di ricarica, consumo energetico, proprietà e dati della stazione, ecc.) e la marca, il modello e l’anno del veicolo dell’utente per amministrare il suo account, ad esempio per distinguere tra più veicoli o utenti che condividono un singolo account e per scopi analitici.

Nella misura in cui l’utente non acconsente alle pratiche di trattamento delle informazioni qui stabilite, potrebbe avere il diritto di scegliere di rifiutare le stesse. Tutte le richieste di opt-out devono essere indirizzate a [\[email protected\]](https://company.plugshare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Nella misura in cui le richieste di opt-out siano rispettate, avranno effetto sul trattamento futuro e non sul trattamento che si è verificato in base al previo consenso.

2.1 PROCESSO DECISIONALE AUTOMATIZZATO
--------------------------------------

Possiamo utilizzare i dati personali dell’utente che ci fornisce e che otteniamo da altre fonti per comprendere meglio i suoi interessi, in modo da poter cercare di prevedere quali altri Prodotti, Servizi e informazioni potrebbero essere di suo interesse. Questa pratica prevede di prendere decisioni automatizzate sull’utente in base a queste informazioni al fine di consentirci di personalizzare meglio le nostre interazioni per renderle più pertinenti e interessanti per l’utente. L’utente può opporsi a ciò in qualsiasi momento o chiederci ulteriori informazioni sulla metodologia applicata nei nostri processi decisionali automatizzati contattandoci (si veda la sezione 12 di seguito).

2.2 MESSAGGI DI TESTO
---------------------

I nostri Servizi possono includere l’invio di messaggi SMS (Short Message Service), che possono includere fino a due messaggi al giorno al dispositivo wireless (a meno che l’utente non comunichi ulteriormente con noi), ma la frequenza dei messaggi può variare.  Quando l’utente acconsente espressamente a ricevere messaggi di testo da noi e fornisce un numero di cellulare, accetta di ricevere testi informativi e transazionali ricorrenti da o per conto nostro al numero fornito. Acconsentendo espressamente a ricevere messaggi SMS da noi e fornendo un numero di cellulare, l’utente garantisce e dichiara di essere il proprietario del numero di cellulare che ci fornisce. Possiamo utilizzare le informazioni dell’utente per contattarlo in merito all’utilizzo, agli acquisti, ai resi (se disponibili), agli aggiornamenti del Sito web, alla conduzione di sondaggi o alle comunicazioni informative e relative ai servizi, inclusi importanti aggiornamenti di sicurezza. Dopo averci inviato il messaggio SMS “STOP”,  invieremo all’utente un messaggio SMS per confermare che ha annullato l’iscrizione. In alternativa, l'utente può inoltrare la propria richiesta via e-mail, indicando l'indirizzo e-mail e il numero di telefono registrati presso di noi, o con qualsiasi mezzo ragionevole. Successivamente, non riceverà più messaggi SMS da parte nostra. Se l’utente vuole iscriversi di nuovo, è sufficiente che si iscriva come la prima volta e noi ricominceremo a inviargli messaggi SMS. Per ricevere aiuto, rispondere a un messaggio con HELP. Potrebbero essere applicate tariffe per messaggi e dati, a seconda del piano telefonico dell’utente. Le compagnie telefoniche non sono responsabili per messaggi ritardati o non consegnati.

2.3 PLUG-IN PER SOCIAL MEDIA
----------------------------

Integriamo nei Siti web interfacce di programmi applicativi di social media o plug-in (“Plug-in”) da social network, tra cui Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest e/o eventualmente altre società. Per registrarsi come utente, l'utente può avere la possibilità di accedere utilizzando il login di Facebook o di un altro sito di social media.

Ad esempio, quando l’utente visita i nostri Siti web, il plug-in crea una connessione diretta tra il browser e il server Facebook. Ciò consente a Facebook di ricevere informazioni sulla sua visita ai nostri Siti web con il suo indirizzo IP. Se l’utente clicca sul pulsante “Mi piace” di Facebook mentre è connesso al proprio account Facebook, l’utente può collegare i contenuti dei nostri siti web al proprio profilo Facebook. Ciò consente a Facebook di assegnare la sua visita ai nostri Siti web al suo account utente. Si prega di notare che, in qualità di fornitore dei siti web, non riceviamo alcuna notifica sul contenuto dei dati trasmessi o sul loro utilizzo da parte di Facebook. Se l’utente non desidera che Facebook assegni la sua visita ai nostri Siti web al suo account utente Facebook, deve uscire dal suo account utente Facebook.

Se l'utente accede tramite un Plug-in di social media, ci autorizza ad accedere a determinate informazioni sull'account di quel sito di social media, come il suo profilo pubblico sui social media (compatibilmente con le impostazioni sulla privacy del sito di social media), il suo indirizzo e-mail, i suoi interessi, i suoi like, il suo sesso, il suo compleanno, la sua storia formativa, le sue relazioni, i suoi interessi, la sua città attuale, le sue foto, la sua descrizione personale, la sua lista di amici e le informazioni e le foto dei suoi amici del sito di social media che potrebbero essere amici comuni di altri utenti del sito di social media. I plug-in possono trasferire informazioni sull’utente alla rispettiva piattaforma del plug-in senza alcuna azione da parte dell’utente. Queste informazioni possono includere il numero di identificazione utente della piattaforma, il sito web su cui ci si trova e altro ancora. L’interazione con un plug-in trasmetterà le informazioni direttamente al social network di tale plug-in e tali informazioni potrebbero essere visibili ad altri su tale piattaforma. I plug-in sono controllati dall’informativa sulla privacy del rispettivo sito di social media (disponibile sul loro sito web) e non dalla nostra Informativa sulla privacy.

3\. COME DIVULGHIAMO I DATI PERSONALI A TERZI
=============================================

3.1 TIPOLOGIE DI TERZI

Per esercitare il suo diritto di rinuncia, può contattarci all’indirizzo [\[email protected\]](https://company.plugshare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

3.2 FORNITORI DI SERVIZI, PARTNER COMMERCIALI E SUBAPPALTATORI
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Possiamo condividere i dati personali dell’utente con Fornitori di servizi che svolgono servizi per nostro conto, come discusso sopra. Questi Fornitori di servizi possono avere accesso ai dati personali dell’utente al fine di fornire tali servizi a noi o per nostro conto. Se incarichiamo Fornitori di servizi per uno qualsiasi dei suddetti, l’uso dei dati personali dell’utente sarà vincolato da obblighi di riservatezza e il loro utilizzo di tali dati sarà limitato alla fornitura dei loro servizi a noi. Possiamo archiviare i dati personali in luoghi al di fuori del nostro controllo diretto (ad es., su server o database situati o co-ubicati con i Fornitori di servizi di hosting dei dati).  

3.3 PUBBLICITÀ COMPORTAMENTALE INTERCONTESTUALE
-----------------------------------------------

Siamo tenuti a divulgare se condividiamo dati personali con una terza parte impegnata in pubblicità comportamentale (mirata) intercontestuale. Nei dodici (12) mesi precedenti, abbiamo o potremmo aver divulgato le seguenti categorie di dati personali in un contesto che, ai sensi di alcune leggi (ad es., CPRA, GDPR o GDPR del Regno Unito della California) può essere considerato una vendita:

* Identificativi
* Attività Internet o altre attività di rete simili
* Dati di geolocalizzazione

L’utente ha la possibilità di rinunciare a questa condivisione facendo clic sui prompt di esclusione che appariranno sull’avviso che riceve quando visita per la prima volta le nostre applicazioni mobili o i nostri Siti web.

3.4 TRASFERIMENTI AZIENDALI
---------------------------

L’utente riconosce (e non si opporrà) alla nostra divulgazione o trasferimento dei suoi dati personali, dati personali deidentificati, e altre informazioni che ci fornisce, nonché i diritti concessi o riconosciuti nella presente Informativa sulla privacy (collettivamente, “Informazioni trasferite”) a un potenziale o effettivo acquirente o acquirente della nostra società o altro successore allo scopo di valutare o eseguire una fusione, cessione, ristrutturazione, riorganizzazione, dissoluzione, cambiamento nel controllo, o trasferimento di alcune o di tutte le nostre attività (ciascuno dei precedenti indicato come “Cessione”), sia nel corso dell'attività che come parte del fallimento, liquidazione o altro procedimento giudiziario, in cui i dati personali da noi detenuti sono tra i beni trasferiti, e l’utente accetta di non opporsi a tale divulgazione e/o trasferimento. Non possiamo rilasciare alcuna dichiarazione in merito all’uso o al trasferimento delle Informazioni trasferite che potremmo avere in caso di fallimento, riorganizzazione, insolvenza, amministrazione controllata o cessione a beneficio dei creditori. Inoltre, salvo quanto richiesto dalla legge, non siamo e non saremo responsabili per alcuna violazione della sicurezza da parte di terze parti o per qualsiasi azione di terze parti che ricevono qualsiasi Informazione trasferita che ci viene divulgata.

3.5 DIVULGAZIONI RICHIESTE; PROTEZIONE DEI DIRITTI; SICUREZZA
-------------------------------------------------------------

Salvo quanto diversamente descritto nella presente Informativa sulla privacy, non divulgheremo dati personali dell’utente a parti non affiliate, a meno che non sia richiesto dalla legge, da un’ordinanza di un tribunale, procedimento legale (ad es. citazione), tra cui, ma non solo, per rispondere a qualsiasi richiesta governativa, regolatoria o di licenza, o se riteniamo che tale azione sia necessaria per: (a) rispettare la legge, rispettare i procedimenti legali notificati a noi o alle nostre affiliate, controllate, fornitori a contratto, o partner commerciali, o indagare, prevenire, o intraprendere azioni in merito ad attività illecite sospette o effettive; (b) far rispettare i nostri Termini o il contratto con il cliente (anche ai fini della fatturazione e della riscossione); (c) adottare precauzioni contro la responsabilità; (d) indagare e difenderci da eventuali rivendicazioni o accuse di terzi; (e) assistere le forze dell’ordine governative o soddisfare requisiti di sicurezza nazionali o di altro tipo; (f) proteggere la sicurezza o l’integrità dei nostri Siti web, il nostro, Servizi, e applicazioni mobili; o, (g) esercitare o proteggere i diritti, proprietà, o la nostra sicurezza personale, i nostri utenti o altri. 

Cercheremo di notificare all’utente, ove possibile, tali richieste a meno che: (i) la comunicazione sia vietata dal processo legale stesso, dall’ordinanza del tribunale che riceviamo o dalla legge applicabile, o (ii) riteniamo che la comunicazione sarebbe futile, inefficace, crei un rischio di lesioni o danni fisici o di altro tipo a un individuo o gruppo, o crei o aumenti un rischio di frode per noi, i nostri utenti, i nostri Siti web, Servizi o applicazioni mobili. Nei casi in cui rispettiamo le richieste legali senza preavviso per questi motivi, cercheremo di informare l’utente della richiesta dopo aver accertato in buona fede che non siamo più legalmente vietati di farlo e che non si applicano scenari di rischio descritti in questo paragrafo.

3.6 DIVULGAZIONE DI DATI PERSONALI DE-IDENTIFICATI
--------------------------------------------------

Possiamo condividere i Dati personali deidentificati (inclusi, a titolo esemplificativo ma non esaustivo, dati di utilizzo anonimi, pagine e URL di riferimento/uscita, indirizzo IP, tipi di piattaforma, numero di clic, ecc.) con parti non affiliate in qualsiasi modo che scegliamo e per qualsiasi scopo, ad esempio per l’amministrazione del sistema e per monitorare l’utilizzo dei Siti web; per misurare il numero di visite ai nostri Siti web, il tempo medio trascorso, il numero di pagine visualizzate; e monitorare varie altre statistiche del Sito web per migliorare il contenuto.

4\.  RICHIESTE “DO NOT TRACK”
=============================

Alcuni browser web (tra cui Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox e Chrome) incorporano una funzione “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) o simile che segnala ai siti web che un utente non desidera che la propria attività e il proprio comportamento online siano monitorati. Se un sito web che risponde a un particolare segnale DNT riceve il segnale DNT, il browser può impedire a tale sito web di raccogliere determinate informazioni sull’utente del browser. Non tutti i browser offrono un'opzione DNT e i segnali DNT non sono ancora uniformi. Per questo motivo, molti operatori di siti web, tra cui PlugShare, non rispondono ai segnali DNT.

5\. COMUNICAZIONI, PREFERENZE E DISATTIVAZIONE PLUG-SHARE
=========================================================

Fornendoci il proprio indirizzo e-mail, l’utente acconsente all’utilizzo da parte nostra dell’indirizzo e-mail per inviargli avvisi relativi al Servizio, inclusi, a titolo esemplificativo ma non esaustivo, eventuali avvisi richiesti dalla legge (ad es., avviso relativo alla privacy dei dati o a incidenti di sicurezza), al posto della comunicazione via posta. L’utente accetta inoltre che possiamo inviargli notifiche di attività riguardanti i nostri Prodotti, Servizi, Siti web, le applicazioni mobili, i suoi dati personali o qualsiasi aspetto del nostro rapporto, all’indirizzo e-mail che ci fornisce, in conformità con le impostazioni sulla privacy applicabili. Possiamo utilizzare l’indirizzo e-mail dell’utente per inviargli altri messaggi o contenuti, come, a titolo esemplificativo ma non esaustivo, newsletter, aggiunte o modifiche alle funzioni del Servizio o offerte speciali. Se l’utente non desidera ricevere tali messaggi e-mail, può scegliere di non ricerverli facendo clic su Annulla iscrizione, ove disponibile. La disattivazione può impedire la ricezione di messaggi e-mail relativi ad aggiornamenti, miglioramenti, funzioni speciali, annunci o offerte. L’utente non può scegliere di non ricevere e-mail relative al Servizio. Se l’utente ha scelto di non fornirci un’e-mail o un altro indirizzo, potrebbe non ricevere le nostre e-mail relative al Servizio.

Attraverso la pagina delle impostazioni dell’account, l’utente può accedere e, in alcuni casi, modificare o eliminare determinate informazioni che ci ha fornito, come nome e password, indirizzo e-mail, indirizzo, informazioni del profilo utente, ecc. Le informazioni che l’utente può visualizzare, aggiornare ed eliminare possono cambiare man mano che i Prodotti, i Siti web, i Servizi o le nostre pratiche cambiano. In caso di domande sulla visualizzazione o l’aggiornamento delle informazioni che abbiamo in archivio, l’utente è pregato di contattarci. Quando l’utente aggiorna le informazioni, tuttavia, possiamo conservare una copia delle informazioni non aggiornate nei nostri archivi. L'utente può richiedere la cancellazione del proprio account inviando un'e-mail. È responsabilità dell'utente mantenere il proprio indirizzo e-mail aggiornato con noi. A seconda dello stato o del Paese di residenza dell’utente potrebbero essere concessi diritti aggiuntivi. Per ulteriori informazioni, si veda di seguito.

6\. SVILUPPATORI CHE UTILIZZANO SERVIZI DI PIATTAFORMA PLUG-SHARE
=================================================================

Collaboriamo con e consentiamo a terze parti di utilizzare la piattaforma per sviluppatori di PlugShare per offrire servizi e funzionalità in combinazione con PlugShare. Questi sviluppatori terzi hanno negoziato un accordo per utilizzare la tecnologia della piattaforma PlugShare o hanno accettato le nostre interfacce di programmazione delle applicazioni self-service (Application Programming Interfaces, “API”) e i termini del plug-in al fine di creare applicazioni della piattaforma software (“Applicazioni della piattaforma”). Sia gli accordi negoziati che i nostri termini di utilizzo delle API e dei plug-in contengono restrizioni su come le terze parti possono accedere, archiviare e utilizzare i dati personali forniti a PlugShare. Se l’utente sceglie di utilizzare un’Applicazione della Piattaforma, gli sarà chiesto di confermare l’accettazione dell’informativa sulla privacy e del consenso dell’utente dello sviluppatore terzo. Per revocare l’autorizzazione concessa a un’Applicazione della piattaforma, l’utente deve visitare le sue impostazioni. Si noti, tuttavia, che anche se l'utente revoca l'autorizzazione concessa a un'applicazione della piattaforma, le sue connessioni possono continuare a utilizzare l'applicazione della piattaforma, la quale può continuare ad avere accesso a determinate informazioni sull'utente, proprio come le sue connessioni.

7\. CONSERVAZIONE DEI DATI PERSONALI
====================================

Il periodo di tempo per il quale conserviamo i dati personali dell’utente dipende dalle finalità per cui li utilizziamo. Conserveremo i dati personali dell'utente per tutto il tempo in cui il suo account sarà attivo, o per tutto il tempo in cui l'utente sarà un titolare di account registrato o un utente dei nostri Servizi o per tutto il tempo in cui avremo un altro scopo commerciale per farlo (ad esempio, ma non solo, per scopi commerciali, fiscali o legali) e, successivamente, per un periodo non superiore a quello richiesto o consentito dalla legge, o dalla nostra politica di conservazione dei dati, ragionevolmente necessario per scopi di reporting interno e riconciliazione, o per fornire all'utente un feedback o informazioni che potrebbe richiedere. Tale periodo di conservazione è soggetto alla nostra revisione e modifica. Possiamo conservare i dati personali deidentificati per tutto il tempo che riteniamo opportuno.

Dopo la cessazione o la disattivazione dell’account utente, possiamo conservare le informazioni del profilo dell’utente e tutte le informazioni pubblicate nelle aree pubbliche dei Siti web. In seguito alla risoluzione o alla disattivazione dell’account utente, possiamo conservare i dati personali e altri dati dell’utente, ma li manterremo riservati in conformità ai Termini, alla presente Informativa sulla privacy e come richiesto dalla legge applicabile. Abbiamo il diritto di eliminare tutti i dati personali e altri dati dell’utente dopo la cancellazione del suo account utente senza preavviso.

8\. NESSUNA RACCOLTA INTENZIONALE DI DATI DI MINORI
===================================================

Non raccogliamo, sollecitiamo o conserviamo consapevolmente dati personali da persone di età inferiore ai 18 anni né consentiamo consapevolmente a tali persone di registrarsi o utilizzare i nostri Servizi. Se l’utente ha meno di 18 anni dii età, non deve inviarci alcun dato personale. Nel caso in cui venissimo a conoscenza di aver raccolto dati personali da un minore di 18 anni senza la verifica del consenso dei genitori, compiremo ogni sforzo commercialmente ragionevole per eliminare tali informazioni dal nostro database.

9\. DOVE VENGONO TRATTATI E CONSERVATI I DATI PERSONALI; LEGGE APPLICABILE
==========================================================================

La nostra sede centrale è situata negli Stati Uniti. I dati personali che noi o i nostri Fornitori di servizi raccogliamo possono essere archiviati ed elaborati in server all’interno o all’esterno degli Stati Uniti e ovunque noi e i nostri Fornitori di servizi abbiamo strutture in tutto il mondo, e alcune informazioni possono essere accessibili a persone o società al di fuori degli Stati Uniti che ci forniscono servizi. L’utente acconsente alla trasmissione e/o al trasferimento da parte nostra e dei nostri Fornitori di servizi dei suoi dati personali a, o all’accesso ad esse in, giurisdizioni che potrebbero non fornire livelli di protezione dei dati equivalenti a quelli della sua giurisdizione di residenza. Adotteremo misure ragionevoli per garantire che i suoi dati personali ricevano un livello adeguato di protezione nelle giurisdizioni in cui li trattiamo.

Le leggi statunitensi si applicano nella misura in cui l’utente è residente negli Stati Uniti. In caso contrario, la presente Informativa sulla privacy e tutte le altre questioni saranno interpretate in conformità con le leggi della provincia/stato e federali della giurisdizione in cui risiede l’utente. Le giurisdizioni al di fuori della residenza dell’utente possono avere leggi sulla privacy diverse da quelle dell’utente, incluso il diritto delle forze dell’ordine e delle autorità governative di accedere ai dati personali.  Nella misura in cui trattiamo i dati al di fuori del Paese di residenza dell’utente, effettuiamo una valutazione dell’impatto sulla privacy per determinare che i nostri Fornitori di servizi possano offrire sostanzialmente lo stesso livello di protezione richiesto nella sua giurisdizione e stipulino contratti per rafforzare ulteriormente gli obblighi di trattamento appropriato dei suoi dati personali.

10\. SICUREZZA
==============

Abbiamo implementato misure di sicurezza tecniche e organizzative progettate per proteggere i dati personali da perdita accidentale e da accesso, uso, distruzione, alterazione e divulgazione non autorizzati. Tuttavia, si tenga presente che Internet non è un ambiente sicuro al 100%. È responsabilità dell'utente proteggere la sicurezza dei propri dati di accesso, prestare attenzione quando si trasmettono informazioni personali tramite e-mail, messaggistica istantanea e altri mezzi di comunicazione simili, e adottare buone pratiche di sicurezza su Internet. Non invieremo mai un’e-mail all’utente per chiedergli la password o altre informazioni di accesso al suo account. Se l’utente riceve un’e-mail simile, è pregato di inoltrarcela in modo da consentirci di indagare.

Se l’utente è residente in California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah o Connecticut (occasionalmente indicato nel presente documento come “Consumatore”), le leggi statali gli concedono ulteriori diritti in merito al nostro utilizzo dei suoi dati personali.

LEGGE SHINE THE LIGHT DELLA CALIFORNIA
--------------------------------------

La Sezione 1798.83 del Codice civile della California, nota come legge “Shine The Light”, consente a qualsiasi utente residente in California di richiedere e ottenere da noi un elenco di quali dati personali (se presenti) abbiamo divulgato a terzi per scopi di marketing diretto nell’anno solare precedente e i nomi e gli indirizzi di tali terzi. Le richieste possono essere effettuate solo una volta all’anno e sono gratuite.

1. COME RISPONDIAMO AI SEGNALI “DO NOT TRACK”.

Alcuni browser web trasmettono segnali “do not track” (DNT/GPC) ai siti web e ad altri servizi on-line con cui il browser web comunica. Al momento non esiste uno standard che disciplini le azioni che i siti web devono intraprendere quando ricevono questi segnali; tuttavia, attualmente disponiamo di misure per intervenire in risposta a questi segnali.

2. MONITORAGGIO COMPORTAMENTALE DI TERZE PARTI

Possiamo anche utilizzare queste tecnologie per raccogliere informazioni sulle attività online dell’utente nel tempo e su siti web di terze parti o altri servizi online, o associare i dati personali dell’utente ad altre informazioni raccolte in questo modo. Possiamo utilizzare i dati personali per tracciare i modelli di navigazione e clic degli utenti.

L’utente ha il diritto di rinunciare alla vendita o alla concessione in licenza di tali categorie di dati personali a terze parti.

ESERCIZIO DEI DIRITTI
---------------------

Per esercitare i diritti di accesso, correzione, portabilità dei dati e cancellazione sopra descritti, è possibile inviarci una richiesta utilizzando il nostro modulo web disponibile [q](https://company.plugshare.com/privacy-notice.html#data-form)[ui](https://company.plugshare.com/privacy-notice.html#data-form). Solo l’utente o una persona autorizzata ad agire per suo conto può presentare una richiesta relativa ai suoi dati personali. L’utente può anche presentare una richiesta per conto di suo/a figlio/a minorenne. Se riceviamo una richiesta da parte di una persona per l’esercizio di un diritto per conto dell’utente, richiederemo una copia del permesso firmato rilasciato dall’utente che autorizza a presentare tali richieste per suo conto e lo contatteremo per una conferma diretta di tale autorizzazione. L’utente può effettuare una richiesta di accesso o portabilità dei dati solo due volte entro un periodo di 12 mesi. La richiesta verificabile del Consumatore deve:

* fornire informazioni sufficienti che ci consentano di verificare ragionevolmente che l’utente sia la persona di cui abbiamo raccolto i dati personali o che un rappresentante autorizzato abbia fatto la richiesta.
* Descrivere la richiesta dell’utente con dettagli sufficienti che ci consentano di comprenderla, valutarla e rispondervi correttamente.

Non possiamo rispondere alla richiesta dell’utente o fornirgli dati personali se non possiamo verificare la sua identità o autorità per effettuare la richiesta e confermare che i dati personali si riferiscono a lui. Effettuare una richiesta non richiede la creazione di un account con noi. Utilizzeremo i dati personali forniti in una richiesta solo per verificare l’identità o l’autorità del richiedente per effettuare la stessa.

Per esercitare il diritto di rinunciare alla pubblicità comportamentale intercontestuale, la pubblicità mirata o la condivisione dei dati personali come sopra descritto, l’utente dovrà operare tale rinuncia in base alla piattaforma su cui si trova.  Si noti che la richiesta di rinuncia è specifica per il dispositivo e la piattaforma in cui viene presentata, quindi potrebbe essere necessario presentare più richieste se si intende rinunciare a queste attività di trattamento specifiche per più dispositivi e piattaforme. Fare clic:

* [qui per rinunciare a Plugshare.com (piattaforma web)](#)
* [qui per rinunciare all’app Plugshare per iOS](plugshare://ad-preferences)
* [qui per rinunciare all’app Android Plugshare](plugshare://ad-preferences)

### Processo di verifica

Una volta ricevuta una richiesta di accesso, correzione, portabilità o cancellazione dei dati da parte dell’utente, gli invieremo un messaggio di posta elettronica entro 10 giorni lavorativi all'indirizzo di posta elettronica che abbiamo in archivio. L’e-mail chiederà all’utente di rispondere per verificare che sia il Cliente che effettua la richiesta. Al ricevimento della verifica, abbineremo le informazioni dell’utente a quelle contenute nel nostro archivio. Una volta verificata l'identità dell'utente, procederemo all'elaborazione della richiesta e risponderemo entro 45 giorni di calendario, a meno che (a) non siamo in grado di verificare la richiesta, (b) non siamo in grado di abbinare l'utente alle informazioni presenti nel nostro database, o (c) esiste un'eccezione prevista dalla legge che ci esenta dal soddisfare la richiesta. Se abbiamo bisogno di più tempo (fino a quarantacinque (45) giorni di calendario aggiuntivi), informeremo l’utente per iscritto del motivo e del periodo di estensione.

Se non siamo in grado di soddisfare la richiesta dell’utente, la risposta che gli forniremo ne spiegherà i motivi. Per le richieste di portabilità dei dati, selezioneremo un formato per fornire i dati personali dell’utente che sia prontamente utilizzabile e che consenta di trasmettere le informazioni da un’entità a un’altra senza ostacoli.

Non addebitiamo alcuna commissione per elaborare o rispondere alla richiesta verificabile del Cliente, a meno che non sia eccessiva, ripetitiva o manifestamente infondata. Se stabiliamo che la richiesta richiede una commissione, spiegheremo perché abbiamo preso tale decisione e forniremo all’utente una stima dei costi prima di completare la sua richiesta.

INFORMATIVE SULLA PRIVACY PER ALCUNI PAESI NON STATUNITENSI
===========================================================

INFORMAZIONI GENERALI
---------------------

1. ### IL CONSENSO SPECIFICO DELL’UTENTE AL TRATTAMENTO DI CATEGORIE “SENSIBILI” O “SPECIALI” DI DATI PERSONALI
    

Ai sensi delle leggi sulla privacy di alcuni Paesi, alcune tipologie di dati personali sono considerati categorie di informazioni “sensibili” o “speciali”. Raramente trattiamo dati sensibili o categorie speciali, a meno che non si tratti di interessi vitali dell'utente o di un'altra persona. Per tutte le altre circostanze, l'utente acconsente specificamente alla raccolta, al trattamento e alla conservazione da parte nostra di categorie sensibili o speciali di dati personali come descritto nella sezione 1.2 della nostra Informativa sulla privacy principale e acconsente altrimenti al trattamento di dati personali in conformità con la presente Informativa sulla privacy.  

2. ### LE NOSTRE BASI GIURIDICHE PER IL TRATTAMENTO DEI DATI PERSONALI
    

Le nostre basi giuridiche per la raccolta e l’utilizzo dei dati personali sopra descritti dipenderanno dalla tipologia di dati interessati e dal contesto specifico in cui li raccogliamo. In generale, raccoglieremo e tratteremo i dati personali dell’utente solo laddove abbiamo bisogno degli stessi per eseguire i Servizi per i quali l’utente ha stipulato un contratto con noi, o qualora il trattamento sia nei nostri legittimi interessi e non prevalga sui suoi interessi di protezione dei dati o sui suoi diritti e libertà fondamentali, faremo affidamento sul consenso dell’utente, laddove siamo legalmente tenuti a farlo. In alcuni casi, potremmo anche avere l’obbligo legale di raccogliere dati personali dall’utente o potremmo altrimenti aver bisogno dei suoi dati personali per proteggere i suoi interessi vitali o quelli di un’altra persona.

BASE GIURIDICA DEL LEGITTIMO INTERESSE PER LA RACCOLTA DI DATI PERSONALI: La raccolta e il trattamento dei dati personali dell’utente possono essere necessari ai fini dei nostri legittimi interessi. Tali scopi di interesse legittimo possono includere:

* prevenire frodi
* garantire la sicurezza della rete e delle informazioni
* indicare possibili atti criminali o minacce alla sicurezza pubblica, incluso il miglioramento della protezione della nostra comunità contro spam, molestie, violazione della proprietà intellettuale, crimine e rischi per la sicurezza di qualsiasi tipo, e far valere rivendicazioni legali, compresa l’indagine su potenziali violazioni dei nostri Termini di utilizzo
* adempiere ad obblighi legali
* elaborare dati di dipendenti o visitatori, membri, partecipanti o iscritti
* eseguire la funzione o il servizio richiesto dall’utente
* fornire i nostri Servizi e la loro funzionalità all’utente, laddove tale trattamento sia necessario ai fini dei legittimi interessi perseguiti da noi o dai nostri fornitori in relazione ai Servizi
* marketing diretto
* il rapporto pertinente e appropriato che abbiamo con l’utente
* analisi, ad es. valutare il numero di visitatori, le visualizzazioni delle pagine, l’uso dei Siti web, ecc., al fine di comprendere come vengono utilizzati i nostri Siti, Prodotti e Servizi, ottimizzare i Siti e/o le comunicazioni future e sviluppare nuovi servizi e funzionalità dei Siti
* aggiornare le informazioni e preferenze dell’utente
* offrire e migliorare i nostri Siti web, Prodotti e Servizi
* far valere rivendicazioni legali, compresa l’indagine su potenziali violazioni dei nostri Termini

Oltre alle informazioni fornite sopra, le seguenti sezioni si applicano solo ai residenti o ai cittadini del Paese o della regione discussi. Ai fini delle seguenti sezioni, se non specificamente menzionato, la definizione di “dati personali” come sopra utilizzata avrà il significato di informazioni personali, dati personali o termini simili, come applicabile ai sensi delle leggi sulla privacy dei dati di quel Paese o regione. In caso di conflitto tra le sezioni precedenti e quelle di seguito, queste ultime prevarranno.

GDPR – INFORMATIVA SULLA PRIVACY PER I RESIDENTI DELLO SPAZIO ECONOMICO EUROPEO (SEE), DEL REGNO UNITO E DELLA SVIZZERA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ### PANORAMICA
    

Le seguenti disposizioni si applicano solo se l’utente è residente nel SEE, nel Regno Unito o in Svizzera (indicati nella presente sezione per comodità come la “Regione UE”).

Per tali residenti, tutti i trattamenti dei loro dati personali avvengono nel rispetto dei diritti e delle normative sulla privacy, in particolare il Regolamento (UE) 2016/679 del Parlamento europeo e del Consiglio del 27 aprile 2016, noto come Regolamento generale sulla protezione dei dati o il Regolamento generale sulla protezione dei dati del Regno Unito per i residenti di tale paese (collettivamente, "GDPR"), e il nostro trattamento avverrà in conformità con il GDPR. Ai fini del GDPR, noi saremo il “titolare del trattamento” delle informazioni personali (indicati e definiti nel GDPR (disponibile [qui](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/-OIcjXVNa2lpkHu)) come “dati personali”) che raccogliamo, a meno che non raccogliamo tali informazioni per conto di un “titolare del trattamento”, nel qual caso saremo un “responsabile del trattamento”. La presente Informativa sulla privacy non si applica a siti web, applicazioni o servizi che non visualizzano o non rimandano alla presente informativa o che visualizzano o rimandano a un'informativa sulla privacy distinta. Solo per i residenti e i cittadini della Regione UE, nella misura in cui qualsiasi definizione nella presente Informativa sulla privacy sia in conflitto con una definizione ai sensi del GDPR, prevarrà la definizione del GDPR.

Forniamo un’adeguata protezione per il trasferimento dei dati personali in Paesi al di fuori della Regione UE tramite uno o più dei seguenti metodi: (a) una serie di accordi interaziendali basati su o che incorporano le Clausole contrattuali tipo, (b) possiamo fare affidamento sulle decisioni di adeguatezza della Commissione europea su alcuni Paesi, come applicabile, (c) possiamo ottenere il consenso dell’utente per questi trasferimenti di dati dalla Regione UE agli Stati Uniti ad altri Paesi, (d) possiamo adottare norme vincolanti d'impresa, o (e) nella misura applicabile, possiamo fare affidamento su deroghe come stabilito nell’articolo 49 del GDPR per il trasferimento e il successivo trasferimento di dati personali raccolti da individui nella Regione UE negli Stati Uniti e in altri Paesi che la Regione UE ritiene non fornire un’adeguata protezione dei dati. Per quanto riguarda il metodo (e), possiamo trasferire dati personali a terzi per eseguire un contratto con l’utente, con il suo esplicito consenso o in un modo che non prevalga sui suoi diritti e libertà. Se questi dati personali non vengono trattati e trasferiti, non saremo in grado di stipulare il contratto con l’utente o l’utente non avrà accesso a nessuno o a tutti i benefici e le funzionalità associati alla propria transazione.

Potremmo anche dover trasferire le informazioni dell’utente ad altre società del gruppo o fornitori di servizi in Paesi al di fuori della regione UE. Ciò può accadere se i nostri server o fornitori e fornitori di servizi hanno sede al di fuori della regione UE, o se l’utente utilizza i nostri Prodotti e/o Servizi mentre visita Paesi al di fuori di queste aree.

Le nostre basi giuridiche per la raccolta dei dati personali dell’utente sono illustrate nella sezione .

2. ### I DIRITTI SUI DATI DELL’UTENTE AI SENSI DEL GDPR.
    

Se l’utente è soggetto al GDPR, i suoi diritti includono i seguenti:

* diritto di sapere.
* Diritto di rettifica.
* Diritto alla cancellazione.
* Diritto di limitare o opporsi al trattamento. L'utente ha il diritto di opporsi ai seguenti utilizzi dei propri dati personali: (a) trattamento basato su legittimi interessi o sull'esecuzione di un compito di interesse pubblico/esercizio di pubblici poteri (compresa la profilazione); (b) marketing diretto (compresa la profilazione); e (c) trattamento a fini di ricerca scientifica/storica e statistica. Si veda di seguito per maggiori informazioni.
* Diritto di rinuncia. L’utente ha il diritto di non essere soggetto a una decisione basata esclusivamente sul trattamento automatizzato, compresa la profilazione, che produca effetti legali che lo riguardano o che influisca in modo analogo in modo significativo sull’utente, fatte salve le eccezioni applicabili ai sensi delle leggi sulla protezione dei dati pertinenti.
* Diritto di presentare un reclamo. Se l’utente risiede all’interno del SEE, un elenco delle Autorità nazionali per la protezione dei dati è disponibile [qui](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm). Se risiede nel Regno Unito, può contattare l’Ufficio del Commissario per le informazioni [qui.](https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/)
* Diritto di revocare il consenso.

1. ### AVVISO AI RESIDENTI IN ARGENTINA
    

Le misure di sicurezza tecniche e organizzative implementate da PlugShare supporterebbero anche le norme della legge argentina sulla protezione dei dati personali (PDPA) 25.326, come il divieto di qualsiasi uso secondario dei dati personali di un interessato e il divieto di trasferire i dati personali in paesi che non offrono un livello di protezione adeguato. PlugShare utilizza un accordo sul trasferimento/trattamento dei dati per contribuire alla conformità con la disposizione PDPA 60-E/2016, che regola il trasferimento transfrontaliero di dati personali.

I residenti in Argentina hanno (a) il diritto di conoscere l’esistenza e lo scopo di tali dati personali, e (b) il diritto di rettifica e il diritto di limitare o opporsi al trattamento dei loro dati personali se sono falsi, inaccurati o discriminatori.

2. ### AVVISO AI RESIDENTI IN AUSTRALIA
    

Possiamo utilizzare e divulgare i dati personali dell'utente (come definiti dalla legge australiana) a terzi con sede al di fuori dell'Australia, principalmente negli Stati Uniti, come descritto nella sezione 9 della nostra Informativa sulla privacy principale. L’utente accetta e riconosce che i destinatari esteri saranno soggetti alla legge sulla privacy della loro giurisdizione locale e non possono essere soggetti ad alcun obbligo sulla privacy o a principi simili ai Principi sulla privacy australiani. Essi saranno inoltre soggetti a una legge straniera che potrebbe obbligare la divulgazione di dati personali a terzi, come un’autorità estera. A meno che l’utente non ci comunichi per iscritto il contrario, sarà tenuto ad acconsentire alla divulgazione da parte nostra di dati personali a destinatari esteri. L’utente ha la possibilità di rimanere anonimo quando tratta con noi o di non divulgarci determinati dati personali. Tuttavia, ciò può significare che potremmo non essere in grado di fornire i nostri Servizi all’utente.

Per i residenti in Australia, gli aggiornamenti alla presente Informativa sulla privacy sono efficaci, se otteniamo il consenso esplicito dell’utente o se forniamo un’opzione di rinuncia quando vengono annunciate modifiche sostanziali (ad es., sui nostri Siti web o via e-mail).

3. ### AVVISO AI RESIDENTI IN BRASILE
    

I residenti in Brasile hanno il diritto di conoscere le seguenti informazioni: se la trasmissione a noi dei loro dati personali è un requisito contrattuale, o se vi sono conseguenze nel non fornire tali dati (la risposta è no a entrambi), informazioni relative a qualsiasi processo decisionale automatizzato (inclusa la profilazione) che eseguiamo (si veda la sezione 2.1 della nostra Informativa sulla privacy principale). L’utente ha il diritto di revocare il consenso al trattamento dei suoi dati personali, e, i diritti di accesso dell’interessato (si veda di seguito).

I residenti in Brasile sono titolari dei seguenti diritti: (a) il diritto di sapere se trattiamo loro dati personali, incluso quello di ottenere una copia di tali informazioni; (b) il diritto di rettifica; (c) il diritto di limitare o opporsi al trattamento; (d) il diritto di cancellazione; (e) il diritto di ricevere informazioni sulle pratiche sulla privacy relative alle entità pubbliche e private con cui i dati personali sono stati condivisi; e (f) il diritto di presentare un reclamo all’autorità di controllo dei dati brasiliana (ANPD).

P-39.1). Per qualsiasi pratica di gestione delle informazioni che non sia ragionevolmente correlata agli scopi per cui l’utente ha contattato PlugShare, l’utente ha il diritto di rinunciare a tali pratiche (tra cui marketing, profilazione, pubblicità comportamentale, condivisione con una terza parte che non è un fornitore di servizi).  

I residenti canadesi hanno il diritto di rifiutare il nostro utilizzo dei loro dati personali per scopi di marketing diretto e altri trattamenti che non sono ragionevolmente necessari per rispondere a ciò per cui ci hanno contattato.

1.3 WAAR WE PERSOONLIJKE INFORMATIE VERZAMELEN
----------------------------------------------

We kunnen Persoonlijke informatie rechtstreeks van u verzamelen via onze Diensten wanneer u:

* Persoonlijke informatie aan ons verstrekt door webformulieren op onze Websites in te vullen of transacties uit te voeren in winkels (merken van moeder-, dochterondernemingen en gelieerde bedrijven). Dit omvat informatie die wordt verstrekt bij het aanmaken van een online account, het kopen van onze Diensten, het abonneren op onze e-nieuwsbrieven of andere communicatie, het opvragen van informatie bij ons, het indienen of plaatsen van materiaal (indien toegestaan) op onze forums, of het communiceren met klantenondersteuning of -dienst, het melden van een probleem met onze Websites, mobiele applicaties of Diensten, of het anderszins communiceren met ons.

Hoewel gebruikers toegang hebben tot beperkte functies zonder hun Persoonlijke informatie bekend te maken, zoals het browsen door openbare oplaadstations zonder een account, verzamelen we Persoonlijke informatie wanneer gebruikers een account registreren. Gebruikers kunnen ervoor kiezen om alleen hun e-mail en wachtwoord te gebruiken om thuisopladers te doorzoeken. Gebruikers kunnen er ook voor kiezen om te profiteren van de verbeterde mogelijkheden door aanvullende Persoonlijke informatie te plaatsen, te becommentariëren, te publiceren of door te geven aan de gemeenschap. Over het algemeen kiezen gebruikers hoeveel informatie ze over zichzelf willen weergeven en kunnen ze zich op elk moment afmelden.

We kunnen ook Persoonlijke informatie verzamelen van niet-gelieerde partijen, waaronder:

1.4 INFORMATIE VERZAMELD VIA GEAUTOMATISEERDE TECHNOLOGIEËN
-----------------------------------------------------------

Terwijl u door onze Diensten navigeert en ermee communiceert, kunnen we ook technologieën voor automatische gegevensverzameling gebruiken om bepaalde informatie van uw apparaat, browser of andere netwerkactiviteiten te verzamelen, zoals beschreven in ons Cookiebeleid, beschikbaar op [https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html](https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html).

Websitebezoek en apparaatinformatie. We verzamelen gegevens over uw bezoeken aan onze Websites en het gebruik van onze mobiele apps, inclusief, maar niet beperkt tot, verkeersgegevens, geolocatiegegevens, logboeken en andere communicatiegegevens en de hulpbronnen die u opent en gebruikt op de Websites. We verzamelen informatie over uw computer, mobiele apparaat en internetverbinding, waaronder uw IP-adres, besturingssysteem, soort browser, klikstroompatronen (d.w.z. waar u op klikt op een website), de URL van de meest recente website die u hebt bezocht voordat u naar onze Websites kwam, de hoeveelheid tijd die u op onze Websites hebt doorgebracht en de pagina’s die u op onze Websites hebt bekeken. We kunnen een ruwe schatting van uw locatie afleiden van uw IP-adres wanneer u onze Websites bezoekt. Voor gebruikers van onze mobiele apps kunnen we ook de geschiedenis van uw exacte locatiegegevens verzamelen en bijhouden met behulp van wifi- en/of Bluetooth-technologieën, evenals uw apparaat-ID’s en GPS-coördinaten (bijv. breedtegraad/lengtegraad). Als u het verzamelen van uw locatiegegevens wilt voorkomen, pas dan uw instellingen aan op uw mobiele apparaat om de toegang van de mobiele app tot uw locatiegegevens te beperken.

Wanneer u onze website gebruikt, delen we informatie die we van u verzamelen, zoals uw e-mail (in gehashte vorm), IP-adres of informatie over uw browser of besturingssysteem, met onze identiteitspartners/serviceproviders. Deze partners sturen een online identificatiecode terug die we kunnen opslaan in onze first-party cookie voor ons gebruik in online, in-app en cross-channel advertenties en deze kan worden gedeeld met advertentiebedrijven om op interesses gebaseerde en gerichte advertenties mogelijk te maken. Klik hier ([https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/)) om u af te melden voor dit gebruik.

Gedragstracering. We kunnen deze technologieën ook gebruiken om informatie te verzamelen over uw online activiteiten in de loop der tijd en op websites van derden of andere online diensten, of om Persoonlijke informatie te koppelen aan andere informatie die op deze manier wordt verzameld.

Locatieanalyse: onze mobiele apps en mobiele browserwebsites bevatten functionaliteit (bijv. voor het indienen van een bestuurdersbeoordeling van een oplaadpunt) waarmee we de locatie van een bestuurder en de locatie van het oplaadpunt waar een gebruiker zich momenteel bevindt, kunnen vaststellen. We verzamelen informatie zoals IP-adres, apparaat-ID en geolocatie. Gebruikers van de mobiele app kunnen ervoor kiezen om de mobiele apps anoniem te gebruiken of om in te loggen als een geïdentificeerde gebruiker, in welk geval de persoonsgegevens die bij de registratie zijn verstrekt, kunnen worden gebruikt.

Voor gebruikers van de mobiele apps kunnen we toestemming vragen voor toegang tot bepaalde informatie vanaf uw mobiele apparaat, waaronder uw contactlijst, foto’s en video’s, en microfoon en camera. Het is optioneel dat u ons toegang geeft tot deze informatie. Bepaalde functies van de mobiele apps werken echter eventueel niet optimaal als u besluit om ons geen toestemming te geven.

Webbakens. Pagina’s van onze Websites en onze e-mails kunnen kleine elektronische bestanden bevatten die bekend staan als webbakens (ook wel ‘clear gifs’, ‘pixeltags’ en ‘single-pixel gifs’ genoemd) die ons bijvoorbeeld in staat stellen om gebruikers te tellen die deze pagina’s hebben bezocht of een e-mail hebben geopend en voor andere gerelateerde websitestatistieken (bijvoorbeeld het vastleggen van de populariteit van bepaalde website-inhoud en het verifiëren van de integriteit van het systeem en de server).

Pixels volgen. Naast het gebruik van cookies kunnen de Websites gebruikmaken van “pixels volgen”. Pixels volgen omvat het gebruik van pixeltags die niet zichtbaar zijn voor de gebruiker en bestaan uit een paar regels computercode. Pixels volgen meet de effectiviteit van advertenties en stelt geaggregeerde en specifieke gebruiksstatistieken samen. We kunnen toegang krijgen tot deze pixeltags om activiteiten en interesses te identificeren die ons in staat kunnen stellen onze Producten, Diensten en aanbiedingen beter af te stemmen op uw interesses en behoeften. Als u bijvoorbeeld onze Websites bezoekt vanuit een advertentie op een andere website, stelt de pixeltag de adverteerder in staat om bij te houden dat zijn advertentie u naar de Websites heeft gebracht. Als u onze Websites bezoekt en we u naar een andere website doorkoppelen, kunnen we eventueel ook vaststellen dat u bent gestuurd naar en/of transacties hebt uitgevoerd met een website van derden.

GIF (Graphics Interchange Format). We kunnen kleine afbeeldingen gebruiken die bekend staan als transparante GIF’s om het gedrag van gebruikers bij te houden, inclusief statistieken over wie onze e-mails opent.

IP-adres. Onze servers (of die van onze dienstverleners) registreren automatisch bepaalde logbestandinformatie die door uw browser wordt gerapporteerd wanneer u de Websites bezoekt. Deze serverlogboeken kunnen informatie bevatten zoals welke pagina’s van de Websites u hebt bezocht, uw internetprotocol (“IP”)-adres, soort browser en andere informatie over hoe u met de Websites omgaat. Deze logbestanden worden over het algemeen periodisch verwijderd.

Statistieken en analyses van derden. Statistieken en analyses van derden, op bepaalde pagina’s of functies van de Diensten voor meer inzicht in en analyse van het bezoekersverkeer en om de promotionele effectiviteit en werkzaamheid van onze functies, aanbiedingen en marketingcampagnes te meten. We gebruiken deze hulpmiddelen ook om valkuilen, tekortkomingen en gebieden van onze activiteiten vast te stellen die moeten worden verbeterd, en om de algemene prestaties en rangorde van onze online aanwezigheid te bekijken. Deze hulpmiddelen kunnen naar eigen goeddunken cookies op uw apparaat opslaan.

COOKIEVERKLARING EN -BELEID

De technologieën die we gebruiken voor automatische gegevensverzameling omvatten ook cookies, zoals hieronder beschreven.

Browsercookies

Browsercookies zijn kleine bestanden die op de harde schijf van uw computer of mobiele apparaat worden geplaatst. Ze kunnen bepaalde gegevens bevatten, waaronder, maar niet beperkt tot, de naam van de server die ze daar heeft geplaatst, een identificatie in de vorm van een uniek nummer en een vervaldatum (alleen sommige cookies). Browsercookies worden beheerd door de webbrowser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome enz.) op uw computer of mobiele apparaat. Op onze Websites worden verschillende soorten cookies gebruikt die verschillende doeleinden hebben.

Essentiële cookies

Essentiële cookies zijn essentieel om u in staat te stellen onze Websites te bezoeken en de functies ervan te gebruiken. Zonder deze cookies zouden diensten zoals winkelmandjes en elektronische facturering niet kunnen werken.

Prestatiecookies

Prestatiecookies verzamelen informatie over het gebruik van onze Websites, zoals welke pagina’s het vaakst worden geraadpleegd. Deze informatie stelt ons in staat om onze Websites te optimaliseren en het browsen (bladeren) te vereenvoudigen. Prestatiecookies stellen onze gelieerde ondernemingen en partners ook in staat om te weten te komen of u een van onze websitepagina’s hebt geopend vanaf hun website en of uw bezoek heeft geleid tot het gebruik of de aankoop van een product of dienst van onze Websites, inclusief de referenties voor het gekochte product of de gekochte dienst. Alle informatie die door prestatiecookies wordt verzameld, is samengevoegd en daarom anoniem.

Functionaliteitscookies

Functionaliteitscookies stellen onze Websites in staat om de keuzes te onthouden die u hebt gemaakt tijdens het browsen. We kunnen bijvoorbeeld uw geografische locatie opslaan in een cookie, zodat de Websites die overeenkomen met uw gebied worden weergegeven. We kunnen ook uw voorkeuren onthouden, zoals de tekstgrootte, het lettertype en andere aanpasbare aspecten van de Websites. Functionaliteitscookies kunnen ook de geraadpleegde producten of video’s bijhouden om herhaling te voorkomen. De informatie die door deze cookies wordt verzameld kan niet worden gebruikt om u te identificeren en kan uw surfactiviteit op websites die niet van ons zijn, niet volgen. Functionaliteitscookies stellen ons in staat om advertenties weer te geven die op u zijn afgestemd op onze Websites, om te begrijpen welke delen van onze inhoud u het meest interesseren en welke product- of dienstcategorieën u aanvraagt. Sommige van onze dienstverleners mogen cookies op onze Websites plaatsen. Deze bedrijven kunnen u ook de mogelijkheid bieden om het gebruik van cookies in de toekomst te voorkomen.

U kunt op elk moment het toekomstige gebruik van bepaalde cookies voorkomen of weigeren door de juiste instelling in uw browser te activeren voor het weigeren van het accepteren van browsercookies. Als u dit echter doet, kan dit invloed hebben op uw ervaring op onze Websites; u kunt bijvoorbeeld misschien geen toegang krijgen tot bepaalde delen van onze Websites. Tenzij u uw browserinstelling zodanig hebt aangepast dat cookies worden geweigerd, geeft ons systeem cookies uit wanneer u uw browser naar onze Websites leidt.

Cookies voor lokale opslag

Bepaalde functies van onze Websites kunnen lokaal opgeslagen objecten gebruiken om informatie over uw voorkeuren en navigatie naar, van en op onze Websites te verzamelen en op te slaan. Lokale opslagcookies worden niet beheerd door dezelfde browserinstellingen als worden gebruikt voor browsercookies.

We kunnen de Persoonlijke informatie die we van u verzamelen buiten onze Websites of Diensten ook combineren met Persoonlijke informatie die wordt verzameld via onze Websites of Diensten of op een andere manier zoals hierboven beschreven.

1.5 APPARAAT-, NETWERK-, GEOLOCATIE- EN EV-INFORMATIE
-----------------------------------------------------

Wanneer u onze Websites of Diensten bezoekt of verlaat door op een hyperkoppeling te klikken of een plug-in op een website van derden te bekijken, ontvangen we automatisch de URL van de website waar u vandaan kwam of de website waar u naartoe wordt geleid. Adverteerders ontvangen ook de URL van de pagina waarop u zich bevindt wanneer u klikt op een advertentie die op onze Diensten kan verschijnen. We ontvangen ook het internetprotocol (“IP”)-adres van uw computer of de proxyserver die u gebruikt om toegang te krijgen tot het internet, de gegevens van uw computerbesturingssysteem, uw soort webbrowser, uw mobiele apparaat (inclusief uw mobiele apparaat-ID verstrekt door het besturingssysteem van uw mobiele apparaat), uw mobiele besturingssysteem (als u onze Websites of diensten bezoekt via een mobiel apparaat) en de naam van uw ISP (Internet Service Provider) of uw mobiele aanbieder.

1.6 ENQUÊTES
------------

Wij of niet-gelieerde partijen kunnen gebruikersenquêtes uitvoeren met betrekking tot onze Diensten. Sommige niet-gelieerde partijen kunnen advertenties of promoties op u richten op basis van uw antwoorden op de enquête. Wij of niet-gelieerde partijen ontwikkelen nieuwe programma’s of producten op basis van de informatie die u meedeelt in de enquêtes. We kunnen niet-gelieerde partijen gebruiken om u financiële of andere stimulansen te bieden om deel te nemen aan enquêtes. Als de levering van een stimulans uw contactgegevens vereist, kunt u worden gevraagd om Persoonlijke informatie te verstrekken aan de niet-gelieerde partij die het stimulansaanbod uitvoert, die alleen zal worden gebruikt voor het leveren van de beloofde stimulansen en het verifiëren van uw contactgegevens. U beslist zelf of u deze informatie verstrekt of dat u gebruik wilt maken van een stimulans-aanbieding. Uw toestemming voor het gebruik van Persoonlijke informatie voor de doeleinden die in de enquête worden uiteengezet, wordt uitdrukkelijk gevraagd door de niet-gelieerde partij die deze uitvoert. Om u af te melden voor onze enquêtes, kunt u uw verzoek naar ons sturen via de onderstaande contactgegevens.

2\. AARD EN DOEL VAN DE VERWERKING VAN PERSOONLIJKE INFORMATIE
==============================================================

We gebruiken informatie die we over u verzamelen of die u aan ons verstrekt, inclusief Persoonlijke informatie, voor een of meer van de volgende doeleinden:

* om onze Websites en mobiele applicaties en de inhoud ervan aan u te presenteren.
* om u informatie te verstrekken en te reageren op uw vragen over Producten of Diensten die u van ons aanvraagt en informatie over nieuwe producten en diensten, kortingen, speciale promoties of aanstaande evenementen, en functies of aanbiedingen waarvan wij denken dat ze interessant voor u zijn of met betrekking tot een promotie, wedstrijd of loterij waaraan u hebt deelgenomen
* om rekeninginformatie en transactiebetalingen te verwerken, inclusief, maar niet beperkt tot, product- en/of dienstverleningskosten, en betalingen en terugbetalingen voor gekochte Producten of Diensten (hoewel we niet uw volledige creditkaart- of betaalkaartnummer ontvangen).

* om enig ander doel te vervullen waarvoor u Persoonlijke informatie verstrekt.
* op elke andere manier die we kunnen beschrijven en waarvoor we uw toestemming verkrijgen wanneer u de informatie verstrekt.

We gebruiken cookies, transparante gifs en logbestandsinformatie om: (a) informatie te onthouden zodat u deze niet opnieuw hoeft in te voeren tijdens uw bezoek of de volgende keer dat u de Websites bezoekt; (b) aangepaste, gepersonaliseerde inhoud en informatie te aan bieden; (c) de effectiviteit van onze Diensten te controleren; (d) geaggregeerde statistieken zoals het totale aantal bezoekers, verkeer, en demografische patronen bij te houden; (e) technologische problemen te diagnosticeren of op te lossen die door onze gebruikers of technici worden gemeld en die verband houden met bepaalde IP-adressen; en/of, (f) u te helpen efficiënt toegang te krijgen tot uw informatie nadat u zich hebt aangemeld.

Statistische gegevens die we automatisch verzamelen helpen ons om onze Websites te verbeteren en betere, meer gepersonaliseerde Producten en Diensten te leveren, inclusief, maar niet beperkt tot, door ons in staat te stellen: de omvang en gebruikspatronen van ons publiek/onze bezoekers te schatten, informatie over uw voorkeuren op te slaan, ons in staat te stellen onze Websites aan te passen en te verbeteren, uw zoekopdrachten te versnellen en/of u te herkennen wanneer u terugkeert naar onze Websites.

We kunnen informatie over uw EV-oplaadsessie verzamelen en gebruiken (bijv. oplaadtijd, energieverbruik, eigenaarschap en gegevens van het station enz.) en het merk, model en jaar van uw voertuig om uw account te beheren, bijvoorbeeld om onderscheid te maken tussen meerdere voertuigen of gebruikers die één account delen, en voor analytische doeleinden.

Voor zover u niet instemt met de hierin uiteengezette praktijken voor informatieverwerking, hebt u wellicht het recht om u af te melden voor dergelijke praktijken. Alle afmeldingsverzoeken moeten worden gericht aan [\[email protected\]](https://company.plugshare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Voor zover afmeldingsverzoeken worden gehonoreerd, hebben ze effect op toekomstige verwerking en niet op verwerking die heeft plaatsgevonden op basis van eerdere toestemming.

2.1 GEAUTOMATISEERDE BESLUITVORMING
-----------------------------------

We kunnen uw Persoonlijke informatie die u ons verstrekt en die we uit andere bronnen verkrijgen gebruiken om uw interesses beter te begrijpen, zodat we kunnen proberen te voorspellen in welke andere Producten, Diensten en informatie u het meest geïnteresseerd bent. Deze praktijk omvat het nemen van geautomatiseerde beslissingen over u op basis van deze informatie om ons beter in staat te stellen onze interacties met u aan te passen om ze relevanter en interessanter te maken. U kunt te allen tijde bezwaar maken tegen het feit dat wij dit doen of ons vragen om meer informatie over de methodologie die wordt toegepast in onze geautomatiseerde besluitvormingsprocessen door contact met ons op te nemen (zie sectie 12 hieronder).

2.2 TEKSTBERICHTEN
------------------

Onze Diensten kunnen het verzenden van Short Message Service (“SMS”)-berichten omvatten, die maximaal twee berichten per dag op uw draadloze apparaat kunnen afleveren (tenzij u verder met ons communiceert), maar de berichtfrequentie kan variëren.  Wanneer u uitdrukkelijk instemt met het ontvangen van sms-berichten van ons en een mobiel telefoonnummer opgeeft, stemt u uitdrukkelijk in met het ontvangen van terugkerende informatieve en transactionele teksten van of namens ons op het nummer dat u hebt opgegeven. Door uitdrukkelijk in te stemmen met het ontvangen van sms-berichten van ons en het verstrekken van een mobiel telefoonnummer, garandeert en verklaart u dat u de eigenaar bent van het mobiele telefoonnummer dat u aan ons verstrekt. We kunnen uw informatie gebruiken om contact met u op te nemen over uw gebruik, aankopen, retourzendingen (indien beschikbaar), websiteherzieningen, enquêtes of informatieve en dienstengerelateerde communicatie, waaronder belangrijke beveiligingsberichten. Nadat u het sms-bericht “STOP” naar ons hebt verzonden, sturen we u een sms-bericht om te bevestigen dat u zich hebt afgemeld. U kunt uw verzoek ook per e-mail bij ons indienen, met vermelding van het e-mailadres en telefoonnummer dat u bij ons hebt geregistreerd, of op een andere redelijke manier. Hierna ontvangt u geen sms-berichten meer van ons. Als u zich opnieuw wilt aanmelden, meld u dan gewoon aan zoals u dat de eerste keer hebt gedaan en dan sturen we u weer sms-berichten. Voor assistentie kunt u een tekst beantwoorden met HELP. Er kunnen tarieven voor berichten en gegevens van toepassing zijn, afhankelijk van uw mobiele telefoonabonnement. Aanbieders zijn niet aansprakelijk voor vertraagde of niet-geleverde berichten.

2.3 PLUG-INS VOOR SOCIALE MEDIA
-------------------------------

We integreren interfaces of plug-ins voor sociale media (“Plug-ins)”) van sociale netwerken, waaronder Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest en/of eventueel andere bedrijven, in de Websites. Om u als gebruiker bij ons te registreren, kunt u de optie hebben om u aan te melden met uw Facebook- of andere login voor sociale-mediawebsites.

Wanneer u bijvoorbeeld onze Websites bezoekt, creëert de plug-in een directe verbinding tussen uw browser en de Facebook-server. Hierdoor kan Facebook informatie ontvangen over uw bezoek aan onze Websites met uw IP-adres. Als u op de knop “Vind ik leuk” van Facebook klikt terwijl u bent ingelogd op uw Facebook-account, kunt u de inhoud van onze Websites koppelen aan uw Facebook-profiel. Dit stelt Facebook in staat om uw bezoek aan onze Websites toe te wijzen aan uw gebruikersaccount. Houd er rekening mee dat we als aanbieder van de Websites geen kennisgeving ontvangen over de inhoud van de verzonden gegevens of het gebruik ervan door Facebook. Als u niet wilt dat Facebook uw bezoek aan onze Websites toewijst aan uw Facebook-gebruikersaccount, log dan uit bij uw Facebook-gebruikersaccount.

Als u inlogt via een Plug-in van sociale media, geeft u ons toestemming om toegang te krijgen tot bepaalde accountinformatie vanaf die sociale-mediawebsite, zoals uw openbare sociale-mediaprofiel (in overeenstemming met uw privacy-instellingen op de sociale-mediawebsite), uw e-mailadres, interesses, vind-ik-leuk-waarderingen, gender, verjaardag, opleidingsgeschiedenis, relaties, interesses, huidige plaats, foto’s, persoonlijke beschrijving, lijst met vrienden en informatie over en foto’s van uw vrienden op de sociale- mediawebsite die gemeenschappelijke vrienden met andere gebruikers kunnen zijn op de sociale-mediawebsite. Plug-ins kunnen informatie over u overdragen naar het respectieve platform van de plug-in zonder dat u actie hoeft te ondernemen. Deze informatie kan het gebruikersidentificatienummer van uw platform omvatten, op welke website u zich bevindt en dergelijke. Interactie met een plug-in verzendt informatie rechtstreeks naar het sociale netwerk van die plug-in en die informatie kan zichtbaar zijn voor anderen op dat platform. Plug-ins worden beheerd door het privacybeleid van de respectieve sociale-mediawebsite (beschikbaar op hun website) en niet door ons Privacybeleid.

3\. HOE WE PERSOONLIJKE INFORMATIE BEKENDMAKEN AAN NIET-GELIEERDE PARTIJEN

Neem om uw recht op afmelding uit te oefenen contact met ons op via [\[email protected\]](https://company.plugshare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

3.2 DIENSTVERLENERS, ZAKENPARTNERS EN ONDERAANNEMERS
----------------------------------------------------

 We kunnen uw Persoonlijke informatie doorgeven aan dienstverleners die namens ons diensten verlenen, zoals hierboven besproken. Deze dienstverleners kunnen toegang hebben tot uw Persoonlijke informatie om deze diensten aan ons of namens ons te leveren. Als we dienstverleners inschakelen voor iets van het voorgaande, is het gebruik van uw Persoonlijke informatie gebonden aan geheimhoudingsverplichtingen en hun gebruik van Persoonlijke informatie is beperkt tot het leveren van hun diensten aan ons. We kunnen Persoonlijke informatie opslaan op locaties buiten onze directe controle (bijvoorbeeld op servers of gegevensbestanden die zich bevinden op locaties voor of samen met dienstverleners voor gegevenspresentatie)  

3.3 CONTEXT-OVERSCHRIJDENDE GEDRAGSGERICHTE RECLAME
---------------------------------------------------

We zijn verplicht om bekend te maken of we Persoonlijke informatie doorgeven aan een derde partij die zich bezighoudt met contextoverschrijdende gedragsgerichte (gerichte) reclame. In de afgelopen twaalf (12) maanden hebben we de volgende categorieën Persoonlijke informatie bekendgemaakt of hebben we deze misschien bekendgemaakt in een context die, krachtens bepaalde wetten (bijv. CPRA van Californië, AVG of UK GDPR), kan worden beschouwd als een verkoop:

* identificatoren
* internet- of andere soortgelijke netwerkactiviteiten
* gegevens over geolocatie

U hebt de mogelijkheid om u af te melden voor dit doorgeven door te klikken op de afmeldingsaanwijzingen die verschijnen op de kennisgeving die u wordt aangeboden wanneer u onze mobiele applicaties of Websites voor het eerst bezoekt.

3.4 ZAKELIJKE OVERDRACHTEN
--------------------------

U erkent (en maakt geen bezwaar tegen) onze openbaarmaking of overdracht van uw Persoonlijke informatie, Gedeïdentificeerde Persoonlijke informatie en andere informatie die u aan ons verstrekt, evenals de rechten die u hebt verleend of erkend in dit Privacybeleid (gezamenlijk “Overgedragen informatie”) aan een potentiële of daadwerkelijke koper of overnemende partij van ons bedrijf of een andere opvolger met als doel het overwegen of ondergaan van een fusie, afstoting, herstructurering, reorganisatie, ontbinding, verandering van controle, of overdracht van sommige of al onze activa (elk van het voorgaande aangeduid als een “Overdracht”), hetzij als continu bedrijf of als onderdeel van faillissement, liquidatie of andere gerechtelijke procedure, waarin Persoonlijke informatie die door ons wordt bewaard behoren tot de overgedragen activa, en u stemt ermee in geen bezwaar te maken tegen een dergelijke openbaarmaking en/of overdracht. We kunnen geen verklaringen afleggen met betrekking tot het gebruik of de overdracht van Overgedragen informatie die we eventueel in bezit hebben in geval van ons faillissement, reorganisatie, insolventie, curatele of een overdracht ten behoeve van crediteuren. Bovendien zijn wij, behalve indien wettelijk vereist, niet verantwoordelijk en zullen ook niet verantwoordelijk zijn voor enige inbreuk op de beveiliging door niet-gelieerde partijen of voor enige acties van niet-gelieerde partijen die de Overgedragen informatie ontvangen die aan ons wordt bekendgemaakt.

3.5 VEREISTE OPENBAARMAKINGEN; BESCHERMING VAN RECHTEN; VEILIGHEID
------------------------------------------------------------------

Tenzij anderszins beschreven in dit Privacybeleid, maken wij uw Persoonlijke informatie niet bekend aan een niet-gelieerde partij, tenzij dit wettelijk verplicht is, of op grond van een gerechtelijk bevel, juridische procedure (bijv. dagvaarding), waaronder, maar niet beperkt tot, om te reageren op een verzoek van de overheid, een regelgevende instantie, of vergunningsaanvraag, of als wij van mening zijn dat een dergelijke actie noodzakelijk is om: (a) de wet na te leven, te voldoen aan juridische procedures die worden betekend aan ons of onze gelieerde ondernemingen, dochterondernemingen, gecontracteerde leveranciers, of affiniteitspartners, of om vermoedelijke of daadwerkelijke illegale activiteiten te onderzoeken, voorkomen, of in verband daarmee actie te ondernemen; (b) onze Voorwaarden of klantenovereenkomst af te dwingen (inclusief voor facturerings- en incassodoeleinden); (c) voorzorgsmaatregelen te nemen tegen aansprakelijkheid; (d) onszelf te onderzoeken en verdedigen tegen vorderingen of beschuldigingen van derden; (e) handhavingsinstanties van de overheid te helpen of te voldoen aan nationale of andere veiligheidsvereisten van de overheid; (f) de veiligheid of integriteit van onze Websites, onze Diensten en mobiele applicaties te beschermen; of, (g) de rechten uit te oefenen en ons eigendom of de persoonlijke veiligheid van ons, onze gebruikers of anderen te beschermen. 

We proberen u, indien mogelijk, op de hoogte te stellen van deze verzoeken, tenzij: (i) het verstrekken van kennisgeving is verboden door de juridische procedure zelf, door een gerechtelijk bevel dat we ontvangen, of door de toepasselijke wetgeving, of (ii) we van mening zijn dat het verstrekken van een kennisgeving nutteloos, ineffectief zou zijn, een risico op letsel of lichamelijk of ander letsel voor een persoon of groep zou creëren of het risico op fraude voor ons, onze gebruikers, onze Websites, Diensten of mobiele applicaties zou verhogen. In gevallen waarin we om deze redenen zonder kennisgeving voldoen aan juridische verzoeken, proberen we die gebruiker achteraf op de hoogte te stellen van het verzoek als we te goeder trouw vaststellen dat ons dit niet langer wettelijk verboden is en dat er geen risicoscenario’s zoals beschreven in deze paragraaf van toepassing zijn.

3.6 OPENBAARMAKING VAN GEDEÏDENTIFICEERDE PERSOONLIJKE INFORMATIE
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We kunnen Gedeïdentificeerde Persoonlijke informatie (inclusief, maar niet beperkt tot, anonieme gebruiksgegevens, verwijzende/afsluitpagina’s en URL’s, IP-adres, platformsoorten, aantal klikken enz.) doorgeven aan niet-gelieerde partijen op elke manier die we kiezen en voor elk doel, bijvoorbeeld voor systeembeheer en om het gebruik van de Websites te controleren, voor het meten van het aantal bezoeken aan onze Websites, gemiddelde tijd die is doorgebracht, aantal bekeken pagina’s en het controleren van verschillende andere websitestatistieken om de inhoud te verbeteren.

4\.  “NIET VOLGEN”-VERZOEKEN
============================

Sommige webbrowsers (waaronder Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox en Chrome) bevatten een functie, of soortelijke functie, “Niet volgen” (Do Not Track, “DNT”) die aangeeft aan websites dat een gebruiker zijn of haar online activiteit en gedrag niet wil laten volgen. Als een website die reageert op een bepaald niet-volgen-signaal het niet-volgen-signaal ontvangt, kan de browser die website blokkeren voor het verzamelen van bepaalde informatie over de gebruiker van de browser. Niet alle browsers bieden een niet-volgen-optie en niet-volgen-signalen zijn nog niet uniform. Daarom reageren veel websitebeheerders, waaronder PlugShare, niet op niet-volgen-signalen.

5\. COMMUNICATIE VAN PLUGSHARE, VOORKEUREN EN AFMELDING
=======================================================

Door ons uw e-mailadres te verstrekken, stemt u ermee in dat wij het e-mailadres gebruiken om u dienstengerelateerde kennisgevingen per e-mail te sturen, inclusief, maar niet beperkt tot, kennisgevingen die wettelijk vereist zijn (bijv. kennisgeving van gegevensprivacy- of beveiligingsincidenten), in plaats van communicatie per post. U gaat er ook mee akkoord dat we u meldingen kunnen sturen over activiteiten met betrekking tot onze Producten, Diensten, de Websites, de mobiele applicaties, uw Persoonlijke informatie of enig aspect van onze relatie, naar het e-mailadres dat u ons opgeeft, in overeenstemming met alle toepasselijke privacy-instellingen. We kunnen uw e-mailadres gebruiken om u andere berichten of inhoud te sturen, zoals, maar niet beperkt tot, nieuwsbrieven, toevoegingen of wijzigingen aan functies van de Dienst of speciale aanbiedingen. Als u dergelijke e-mailberichten niet wilt ontvangen, kunt u zich afmelden door te klikken op Afmelden, indien beschikbaar. Als u zich afmeldt, kunt u wellicht geen e-mailberichten ontvangen over herzieningen, verbeteringen, speciale functies, aankondigingen of aanbiedingen. U kunt zich niet afmelden voor dienstengerelateerde e-mails. Als u ervoor hebt gekozen om ons geen e-mail- of ander adres te verstrekken, ontvangt u misschien geen e-mails met betrekking tot onze Diensten.

Via de instellingenpagina van uw gebruikersaccount kunt u bepaalde informatie die u aan ons hebt verstrekt, zoals naam en wachtwoord, e-mailadres, adres, gebruikersprofielinformatie enz. openen en, in sommige gevallen, bewerken of verwijderen. De informatie die u kunt bekijken, bijwerken en verwijderen kan veranderen naarmate de Producten, Websites, Diensten of onze praktijken veranderen. Als u vragen hebt over het bekijken of bijwerken van informatie die we over u hebben, neem dan contact met ons op. Wanneer u informatie bijwerkt, kunnen we echter een kopie van de niet-herziene informatie in onze administratie bewaren. U kunt verzoeken om verwijdering van uw account door ons een e-mail te sturen. Het is uw verantwoordelijkheid om uw huidige e-mailadres bij ons te bewaren. Afhankelijk van in welke staat of welk land u woont, hebt u eventueel aanvullende rechten. Zie hieronder voor meer informatie.

6\. ONTWIKKELAARS DIE PLATFORMDIENSTEN VAN PLUGSHARE GEBRUIKEN
==============================================================

We werken samen met en stellen derden in staat om het ontwikkelaarsplatform van PlugShare te gebruiken om diensten en functionaliteit aan te bieden samen met PlugShare. Deze externe ontwikkelaars hebben ofwel onderhandeld over een overeenkomst om de platformtechnologie van PlugShare te gebruiken of hebben ingestemd met onze zelfbedienings-Application Programming Interfaces (“API”) en plug-invoorwaarden om softwareplatformtoepassingen (“Platformtoepassingen”) te ontwerpen. Zowel de onderhandelde overeenkomsten als onze API- en plug-ingebruiksvoorwaarden bevatten beperkingen over hoe derden toegang kunnen krijgen tot de Persoonlijke informatie die u aan PlugShare verstrekt, en deze kunnen opslaan en gebruiken. Als u ervoor kiest om een platformtoepassing te gebruiken, wordt u gevraagd om acceptatie van het privacybeleid en de gebruikersovereenkomst van de externe ontwikkelaar te bevestigen. Ga naar uw instellingen om de toestemming voor een platformtoepassing in te trekken. Houd er echter rekening mee dat zelfs als u de toestemming voor een platformtoepassing intrekt, uw verbindingen misschien nog steeds gebruikmaken van de platformtoepassing, zodat de platformtoepassing wellicht nog steeds toegang heeft tot bepaalde informatie over u, evenals uw verbindingen dat hebben.

7\. BEWAREN VAN PERSOONLIJKE INFORMATIE
=======================================

De periode waarin we uw Persoonlijke informatie bewaren hangt af van de doeleinden waarvoor we deze gebruiken. We bewaren uw Persoonlijke informatie zolang uw account actief is, of zolang u een geregistreerde accounthouder of gebruiker van onze Diensten bent of zolang we een ander zakelijk doel hebben om dit te doen (zoals, maar niet beperkt tot, voor zakelijke, belasting- of juridische doeleinden) en, daarna, niet langer dan wettelijk is vereist of toegestaan, of ons beleid inzake het bewaren van documenten, redelijkerwijs noodzakelijk is voor interne rapportage- en afstemmingsdoeleinden, of om u terugkoppeling of informatie te geven die u zou kunnen opvragen. Deze bewaartermijn is onderhevig aan onze beoordeling en wijziging. We kunnen Gedeïdentificeerde Persoonlijke informatie bewaren zolang we dit gepast achten.

Na beëindiging of deactivering van uw gebruikersaccount kunnen we uw profielinformatie en alle informatie die op openbare delen van de Websites is geplaatst, bewaren. Na beëindiging of deactivering van uw gebruikersaccount kunnen we uw Persoonlijke informatie en andere gegevens bewaren, maar houden we deze vertrouwelijk volgens de Voorwaarden, dit Privacybeleid en indien vereist door de toepasselijke wetgeving. We hebben het recht om al uw Persoonlijke informatie en andere gegevens na beëindiging van uw gebruikersaccount zonder kennisgeving aan u te verwijderen.

8\. GEEN OPZETTELIJKE VERZAMELING VAN GEGEVENS VAN KINDEREN
===========================================================

We verzamelen, vragen of bewaren niet bewust Persoonlijke informatie van iemand jonger dan 18 jaar of staan niet bewust toe dat dergelijke personen zich registreren voor of gebruikmaken van onze Diensten. Als u jonger bent dan 18 jaar, stuur ons dan geen Persoonlijke informatie. Indien we te weten komen dat we Persoonlijke informatie hebben verzameld van een kind jonger dan 18 jaar zonder verificatie van ouderlijke toestemming, leveren we commercieel redelijke inspanningen om die informatie uit ons gegevensbestand te verwijderen.

9\. WAAR PERSOONLIJKE INFORMATIE WORDT VERWERKT EN OPGESLAGEN; TOEPASSELIJK GELDEND RECHT
=========================================================================================

We hebben ons hoofdkantoor in de Verenigde Staten. De Persoonlijke informatie die wij of onze dienstverleners verzamelen, kan worden opgeslagen en verwerkt op servers binnen of buiten de Verenigde Staten en overal waar wij en onze Dienstverleners faciliteiten over de hele wereld hebben, en bepaalde informatie kan toegankelijk zijn voor personen of bedrijven buiten de Verenigde Staten die diensten voor ons verlenen. U stemt in met de overbrenging en/of overdracht van uw Persoonlijke informatie door ons en onze Dienstverleners naar, of toegang daartoe in, rechtsgebieden die wellicht niet hetzelfde niveau van gegevensbescherming bieden als uw eigen rechtsgebied. We nemen redelijke maatregelen om ervoor te zorgen dat uw Persoonlijke informatie een adequaat beschermingsniveau krijgt in de rechtsgebieden waarin we deze verwerken.

De Amerikaanse wetten zijn van toepassing voor zover u inwoner van de Verenigde Staten bent. Anders worden dit Privacybeleid en alle andere zaken geïnterpreteerd en opgevat in overeenstemming met de provinciale/staats- en federale wetten van het rechtsgebied waar u woont. Rechtsgebieden buiten uw woonplaats kunnen privacywetten hebben die verschillen van die in uw rechtsgebied, waaronder het recht van wetshandhavings- en overheidsinstanties om toegang te krijgen tot de Persoonlijke informatie.  Voor zover we gegevens buiten uw land verwerken, voeren we een privacyeffectbeoordeling uit om te bepalen dat onze Dienstverleners in wezen hetzelfde niveau van bescherming kunnen bieden als vereist in uw rechtsgebied en contracten kunnen aangaan om de verplichtingen om uw Persoonlijke informatie op de juiste manier te verwerken verder te versterken.

10\. BEVEILIGING
================

We hebben technische en organisatorische beveiligingsmaatregelen geïmplementeerd die zijn ontworpen om uw Persoonlijke informatie te beschermen tegen onopzettelijk verlies en tegen onbevoegd(e) toegang, gebruik, vernietiging, wijziging en openbaarmaking. Houd er echter rekening mee dat het internet geen 100% veilige omgeving is. Het is uw verantwoordelijkheid om de veiligheid van uw inloggegevens te beschermen, voorzichtig te zijn bij het verzenden van Persoonlijke informatie via e-mails, chatberichten (instant messaging) en soortgelijke communicatiemiddelen, en goede internetbeveiligingspraktijken te handhaven. We zullen u nooit e-mailen om uw wachtwoord of andere inloggegevens van uw account op te vragen. Als u een dergelijke e-mail ontvangt, stuur deze dan naar ons zodat we dit kunnen onderzoeken.

11\. AANVULLENDE RECHTEN VAN BETROKKENEN VOOR INWONERS IN BEPAALDE RECHTSGEBIEDEN BESCHREVEN IN DE AANVULLENDE PRIVACYVERKLARINGEN

Als u inwoner bent van Californië, Virginia, Colorado, Utah of Connecticut (in dit document soms “consument” genoemd), bieden de wetten van die staten u aanvullende rechten met betrekking tot ons gebruik van uw Persoonlijke informatie.

‘SHINE THE LIGHT’-WET VAN CALIFORNIË
------------------------------------

Paragraaf 1798.83 van het Burgerlijk Wetboek van Californië, bekend als de “Shine The Light”-wet, staat alle gebruikers die inwoners van Californië zijn toe om een lijst op te vragen en van ons te verkrijgen van welke Persoonlijke informatie (indien van toepassing) we in het voorgaande kalenderjaar aan derden hebben bekendgemaakt voor directe-marketingdoeleinden en de namen en adressen van die derden. Aanvragen kunnen slechts eenmaal per jaar worden ingediend en zijn kosteloos.

1. HOE WE REAGEREN OP SIGNALEN VAN NIET VOLGEN.

Sommige webbrowsers sturen “niet volgen” (DNT/GPC) signalen naar de websites en andere online diensten waarmee uw webbrowser communiceert. Er bestaat momenteel geen norm die bepaalt wat websites moeten doen wanneer zij deze signalen ontvangen; wij hebben echter wel maatregelen getroffen om op deze signalen te reageren.

2. GEDRAGSTRACERING VAN DERDEN

We kunnen deze technologieën ook gebruiken om informatie te verzamelen over uw online activiteiten in de loop der tijd en op websites van derden of andere online diensten, of om Persoonlijke informatie te koppelen aan andere informatie die op deze manier wordt verzameld. We kunnen Persoonlijke informatie gebruiken om de klik- en surfpatronen van gebruikers bij te houden.

Alleen u of een persoon die u heeft gemachtigd om namens u te handelen, kan een verzoek indienen met betrekking tot uw Persoonlijke informatie.

We kunnen niet reageren op uw verzoek of u Persoonlijke informatie verstrekken als we uw identiteit of bevoegdheid om het verzoek in te dienen en te bevestigen dat de Persoonlijke informatie op u betrekking hebben, niet kunnen verifiëren. Als u een verzoek indient, hoeft u geen account bij ons aan te maken. We gebruiken alleen Persoonlijke informatie die is verstrekt in een verzoek om de identiteit of bevoegdheid van de aanvrager om het verzoek in te dienen te verifiëren.

Om uw rechten uit te oefenen om u af te melden voor contextoverschrijdende gedragsreclame, gerichte reclame of het doorgeven van Persoonlijke informatie zoals hierboven beschreven, moet u zich afmelden volgens de regels van het platform waarop u zich bevindt.  Houd er rekening mee dat uw verzoek tot afmelding specifiek is voor het apparaat en het platform waarop u dat verzoek indient, zodat u mogelijk meerdere verzoeken zult moeten indienen als u zich voor meerdere apparaten en platforms wilt afmelden voor deze specifieke verwerkingsactiviteiten.

### Verificatieprocedure

Na ontvangst van een verzoek om toegang, correctie, gegevensportabiliteit of verwijdering van gegevens van u sturen we u binnen 10 werkdagen een e-mail naar het e-mailadres dat we voor u in ons bestand hebben. In de e-mail wordt u gevraagd om te reageren om te verifiëren dat u de consument bent die het verzoek indient. Na ontvangst van uw verificatie koppelen we uw informatie aan die welke in ons bestand opgenomen. Na verificatie van uw identiteit verwerken we uw verzoek en reageren we binnen 45 kalenderdagen, tenzij (a) we uw verzoek niet kunnen verifiëren, (b) we niet in staat zijn om u te koppelen aan informatie in ons gegevensbestand, of (c) er een wettelijke uitzondering bestaat die ons vrijstelt van het voldoen aan uw verzoek. Als we meer tijd nodig hebben (maximaal vijfenveertig (45) kalenderdagen extra), informeren we u schriftelijk over de reden en de verlengingsperiode.

Als wij niet aan uw verzoek kunnen voldoen, zullen wij in ons antwoord de redenen hiervoor toelichten. Voor verzoeken om gegevensportabiliteit selecteren we een formaat om uw Persoonlijke informatie te verstrekken dat gemakkelijk bruikbaar is en u in staat moet stellen de informatie zonder belemmering van de ene entiteit naar de andere te verzenden.

We brengen geen kosten in rekening om uw verifieerbare consumentenverzoek te verwerken of te beantwoorden, tenzij het buitensporig, repetitief of kennelijk ongegrond is. Als we bepalen dat het verzoek een vergoeding rechtvaardigt, vertellen we u waarom we die beslissing hebben genomen en geven we u een kostenraming voordat we uw verzoek afhandelen.

In geval van een conflict, en voor zover er een conflict bestaat, tussen de onderstaande secties en de bovenstaande secties, hebben de onderstaande secties voorrang.

AVG – PRIVACYVERKLARING VOOR INWONERS VAN DE EUROPESE ECONOMISCHE RUIMTE (EEA), HET VERENIGD KONINKRIJK EN ZWITSERLAND
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ### OVERZICHT
    

De volgende bepalingen zijn alleen van toepassing als u inwoner bent van de EER, het Verenigd Koninkrijk of Zwitserland (in deze sectie voor het gemak de “EU-regio” genoemd).

Voor dergelijke inwoners wordt alle verwerking van uw Persoonlijke informatie uitgevoerd in overeenstemming met privacyrechten en -voorschriften, met name (EU) 2016/679 van het Europees Parlement en de Raad van 27 april 2016, bekend als de Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming of de General Data Protection Regulation van het Verenigd Koninkrijk voor inwoners van het Verenigd Koninkrijk (gezamenlijk “AVG”), en onze verwerking vindt plaats in overeenstemming met de AVG. Voor de doeleinden van de AVG zijn wij de “verwerkingsverantwoordelijke” van Persoonlijke informatie (aangeduid en gedefinieerd in de AVG ([hier](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) [beschikbaar](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/)) als “persoonsgegevens”) die we verzamelen, tenzij we dergelijke informatie verzamelen namens een “verwerkingsverantwoordelijke” in welk geval wij een “verwerker” zijn. Dit Privacybeleid is niet van toepassing op websites, toepassingen of diensten die dit Privacybeleid niet weergeven of ernaar doorkoppelen of die een ander privacybeleid weergeven of ernaar doorkoppelen. Alleen voor inwoners en staatsburgers van de EU-regio, voor zover een definitie in dit Privacybeleid in strijd is met een definitie krachtens de AVG, heeft de definitie van de AVG voorrang.

Wij bieden adequate bescherming voor de overdracht van Persoonlijke informatie naar landen buiten de EU-regio via een of meer van de volgende methoden: (a) een reeks overeenkomsten tussen bedrijven op basis van of met inbegrip van de modelcontractbepalingen, (b) we kunnen ons baseren op de adequaatheidsbeslissingen van de Europese Commissie over bepaalde landen, indien van toepassing, (c) we kunnen uw toestemming verkrijgen voor deze gegevensoverdrachten van de EU-regio naar de Verenigde Staten naar andere landen, (d) we kunnen bindende bedrijfsregels aannemen, of (e) voor zover van toepassing kunnen we kunnen ons beroepen op vrijstellingen zoals uiteengezet in AVG artikel 49 voor de overdracht en verdere overdracht van Persoonlijke informatie die is verzameld van personen in de EU-regio naar de Verenigde Staten en andere landen die volgens de EU-regio onvoldoende gegevensbescherming bieden. Met betrekking tot methode (e) kunnen we Persoonlijke informatie overdragen aan een derde partij om een contract met u uit te voeren, met uw uitdrukkelijke toestemming of op een manier die niet zwaarder weegt dan uw rechten en vrijheden. Als deze Persoonlijke informatie niet wordt verwerkt en overgedragen, kunnen we het contract met u niet uitvoeren of hebt u geen toegang tot enige of alle voordelen en functies die verband houden met uw transactie.

We moeten uw informatie eventueel ook overdragen aan andere groepsbedrijven of dienstverleners in landen buiten de EU-regio. Dit kan gebeuren als onze servers of leveranciers en dienstverleners buiten de EU-regio zijn gevestigd, of als u onze Producten en/of Diensten gebruikt terwijl u landen buiten deze gebieden bezoekt.

De technische en organisatorische beveiligingsmaatregelen die door PlugShare worden geïmplementeerd, ondersteunen ook regels in de Argentijnse Wet inzake bescherming persoonsgegevens (PDPA) 25.326, zoals het verbod op secundair gebruik van de persoonsgegevens van een betrokkene en het verbod op de overdracht van persoonsgegevens naar landen die geen adequaat beschermingsniveau bieden. PlugShare gebruikt een overeenkomst voor gegevensoverdracht/-verwerking om te helpen bij de naleving van PDPA-bepaling 60-E/2016, die de grensoverschrijdende overdracht van persoonsgegevens regelt.

Ze kunnen ook onderworpen zijn aan een buitenlandse wet die de openbaarmaking van Persoonlijke informatie aan een derde partij, zoals een overzeese autoriteit, zou kunnen afdwingen. Tenzij u ons schriftelijk op de hoogte stelt van het tegendeel, wordt u geacht toestemming te hebben gegeven voor de openbaarmaking door ons van Persoonlijke informatie aan buitenlandse ontvangers. U hebt de mogelijkheid om anoniem te blijven in uw omgang met ons, of om bepaalde Persoonlijke informatie niet aan ons bekend te maken. Dit kan echter betekenen dat we eventueel niet in staat zijn om onze Diensten aan u te leveren.

Voor inwoners van Australië zijn herzieningen van dit Privacybeleid van kracht als we uw uitdrukkelijke toestemming verkrijgen of als we een optie bieden om u af te melden wanneer essentiële wijzigingen worden aangekondigd (bijv. op onze Websites of via e-mail).

Użytkownicy mogą również skorzystać z rozszerzonych możliwości, zawierając w poście, komentując, publikując lub udostępniając społeczności dodatkowe Dane osobowe. Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, do użytkowników należy wybór w zakresie tego, ile informacji chcą wyświetlać na swój temat i mogą w każdej chwili zmienić zdanie.

Możemy również gromadzić Dane osobowe od podmiotów niestowarzyszonych, w tym:

* od dostawców danych (np. firm dostarczających dane demograficzne i inne informacje dotyczące konsumentów);
* w aplikacjach mobilnych (podmioty nadrzędne, zależne i stowarzyszone);
* od wspólnych partnerów marketingowych;
* od firm lub platform reklamowych online (np. jeśli użytkownik dobrowolnie połączy swój profil w mediach społecznościowych z naszymi Usługami);
* od dostawców usług w zakresie realizacji zamówień i dostawy;
* od firm z branży mediów społecznościowych;
* od innych usługodawców;
* w związku odpowiedziami na możliwości zatrudnienia;
* w związku z działaniami związanymi z witryną internetową/formularzem internetowym lub aplikacją;
* od dostawców usług w zakresie weryfikacji zatrudnienia lub weryfikacji danych;
* w sytuacjach, gdzie użytkownik zezwoli, za pośrednictwem ustawień urządzenia lub usług innych firm, abyśmy mogli otrzymywać dane geolokalizacyjne w celu wyświetlania lokalnych informacji (na przykład lokalnej stacji ładowania) w naszych aplikacjach mobilnych.

1.4 INFORMACJE GROMADZONE ZA POMOCĄ ZAUTOMATYZOWANYCH TECHNOLOGII
-----------------------------------------------------------------

W trakcie poruszania się po naszych Usługach i interakcji z nimi możemy również korzystać z technologii automatycznego gromadzenia danych w celu gromadzenia określonych informacji z urządzenia, przeglądarki lub innych działań sieciowych użytkownika, zgodnie z opisem w naszej Polityce dotyczącej plików cookie, dostępnej pod adresem [https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html](https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html).

Odwiedzanie Witryny internetowej a informacje o urządzeniu. Gromadzimy szczegółowe informacje na temat wizyt użytkownika na naszych Witrynach internetowych i korzystania z naszych Aplikacji mobilnych, w tym między innymi dane dotyczące ruchu, dane geolokalizacyjne, dzienniki i inne dane komunikacyjne oraz zasoby, do których użytkownik uzyskuje dostęp i z których korzysta w Witrynach internetowych. Gromadzimy informacje o komputerze, urządzeniu mobilnym i połączeniu internetowym użytkownika, w tym informacje o adresie IP, systemie operacyjnym, typie przeglądarki, wzorcach klikania (tj. tym, co użytkownik kliknął na stronie internetowej), adresie URL ostatniej witryny internetowej, którą użytkownik odwiedził przed wejściem na nasze Witryny internetowe, ilości czasu spędzonego na naszych Witrynach internetowych oraz stronach, które użytkownik przeglądał podczas ich przeglądania. Gdy użytkownik odwiedza nasze Witryny internetowe, jesteśmy w stanie oszacować przybliżoną lokalizację użytkownika na podstawie jego adresu IP. W przypadku użytkowników naszych Aplikacji mobilnych możemy również gromadzić i przechowywać historię dokładnych informacji o lokalizacji użytkownika za pomocą technologii Wi-Fi i/lub Bluetooth, a także identyfikatory urządzeń i współrzędne GPS (np. szerokość geograficzna/długość geograficzna). Aby zapobiec gromadzeniu informacji o swojej lokalizacji, należy dostosować swoje ustawienia na urządzeniu mobilnym, aby ograniczyć dostęp aplikacji mobilnej do informacji o swojej lokalizacji.

Kiedy korzystasz z naszej strony internetowej, udostępniamy informacje, które od Ciebie zbieramy, takie jak Twój adres e-mail (w postaci zaszyfrowanej), adres IP lub informacje o Twojej przeglądarce lub systemie operacyjnym, naszym partnerom/dostawcom usług tożsamości. Partnerzy ci zwracają internetowy kod identyfikacyjny, który możemy przechowywać w naszych własnych plikach cookie do wykorzystania w reklamach online, w aplikacjach i międzykanałowych, i który może być udostępniany firmom reklamowym w celu umożliwienia reklamy opartej na zainteresowaniach i ukierunkowanej. Aby zrezygnować z takiego wykorzystania, kliknij tutaj ([https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/)).

Śledzenie zachowań. Możemy również wykorzystywać te technologie do gromadzenia informacji na temat aktywności użytkownika w Internecie w czasie i na stronach internetowych podmiotów zewnętrznych lub w innych usługach internetowych, lub do kojarzenia Danych osobowych z innymi informacjami zebranymi w ten sposób.

Analityka lokalizacji: nasze Aplikacje mobilne i Witryny internetowe, które można przeglądać z telefonu komórkowego (np. umożliwiające weryfikację miejsca ładowania przez kierowcę), które pozwalają nam zidentyfikować lokalizację kierowcy oraz miejsce ładowania, w którym obecnie znajduje się użytkownik. Gromadzimy informacje takie jak adres IP, identyfikator urządzenia i geolokalizacja. Użytkownicy Aplikacji mobilnych mogą korzystać z Aplikacji mobilnych anonimowo lub zalogować się jako zidentyfikowany użytkownik, w którym to przypadku mogą zostać wykorzystane dane osobowe podane podczas rejestracji.

W przypadku użytkowników Aplikacji mobilnych możemy poprosić o zgodę na dostęp do określonych informacji z urządzenia mobilnego użytkownika, w tym listy kontaktów, zdjęć i filmów oraz mikrofonu i kamery. Udzielenie dostępu do tych informacji nie jest obowiązkowe. Jednak niektóre funkcje Aplikacji mobilnych mogą nie działać optymalnie, jeśli użytkownik zdecyduje się nie udzielić nam zgody.

Sygnały nawigacyjne. Strony naszych Witryn internetowych i nasze wiadomości e-mail mogą zawierać małe pliki elektroniczne znane jako sygnały nawigacyjne (nazywane również przezroczystymi gifami, tagami pikselowymi i jednopikselowymi gifami), które pozwalają nam na przykład liczyć użytkowników, którzy odwiedzili te strony lub otworzyli wiadomość e-mail oraz na potrzeby innych powiązanych statystyk witryny internetowej (na przykład rejestrowanie popularności określonych treści witryny internetowej i sprawdzanie integralności systemu i serwera).

Śledzenie pikseli. Oprócz korzystania z plików cookie Witryny internetowe mogą stosować „śledzenie pikseli”. Śledzenie pikseli polega na użyciu znaczników pikselowych, które nie są widoczne dla użytkownika i składają się z kilku wierszy kodu komputerowego. Śledzenie pikseli mierzy skuteczność reklam i opracowuje zbiorcze i konkretne statystyki użytkowania. Możemy uzyskiwać dostęp do tych znaczników pikselowych w celu identyfikacji aktywności i zainteresowań, które mogą umożliwić nam lepsze dopasowanie naszych Produktów, Usług i ofert do zainteresowań i potrzeb użytkownika. Dla przykładu, jeśli użytkownik odwiedza nasze Witryny internetowe z reklamy znajdującej się na innej witrynie internetowej, tag pikselowy pozwoli reklamodawcy śledzić, czy jego reklama doprowadziła użytkownika do Witryn internetowych. Jeśli użytkownik odwiedza nasze Witryny internetowe i łączymy go z inną witryną internetową, możemy również być w stanie określić, czy użytkownik został wysłany do witryny internetowej podmiotu zewnętrznego i/lub zawierał z nią transakcje.

Piki GIF. Możemy używać małych obrazów znanych jako czyste pliki GIF w celu śledzenia zachowań użytkowników, w tym do sporządzania statystyk dotyczących tego, kto otwiera nasze wiadomości e-mail.

Adres IP. Nasze serwery (lub serwery naszych dostawców usług) automatycznie rejestrują określone informacje z plików dziennika zgłoszone z przeglądarki użytkownika podczas uzyskiwania dostępu do Witryn internetowych. Te dzienniki serwera mogą obejmować informacje, takie jak odwiedzone strony Witryn internetowych, adres protokołu internetowego („IP”), typ przeglądarki oraz inne informacje dotyczące interakcji użytkownika z Witrynami internetowymi. Te pliki dziennika są zazwyczaj okresowo usuwane.

Wskaźniki i analizy stron trzecich. Wskaźniki i analizy osób trzecich mogą być wykorzystywane na niektórych stronach lub w niektórych funkcjach Usług, aby pomóc nam zrozumieć i przeanalizować ruch odwiedzających, mierzyć skuteczność promocyjną i skuteczność naszych funkcji, ofert i kampanii marketingowych. Używamy tych narzędzi również do identyfikowania uchybień, niedociągnięć i obszarów naszej działalności, które wymagają poprawy, a także w ramach sprawdzenia naszych ogólnych wyników i naszej obecności w Internecie. Narzędzia te mogą przechowywać pliki cookie na urządzeniu użytkownika według swego uznania.

OŚWIADCZENIE I POLITYKA DOTYCZĄCA PLIKÓW COOKIE

Technologie wykorzystywane do automatycznego gromadzenia danych obejmują również pliki cookie opisane poniżej.

Pliki cookie przeglądarki

Pliki cookie przeglądarki to małe pliki umieszczane na dysku twardym komputera lub urządzenia mobilnego. Mogą one zawierać pewne dane, w tym między innymi nazwę serwera, który je umieścił, identyfikator w postaci unikalnego numeru oraz datę ważności (tylko niektóre pliki cookie). Pliki cookie przeglądarki są zarządzane przez przeglądarkę internetową (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome itp.) na komputerze lub urządzeniu mobilnym użytkownika. W naszych Witrynach internetowych wykorzystywane są różne rodzaje plików cookie, które mają różne cele.

Niezbędne pliki cookie

Niezbędne pliki cookie są konieczne, aby umożliwić użytkownikowi przeglądanie naszych Witryn internetowych i korzystanie z ich funkcjonalności. Bez nich usługi, takie jak koszyki zakupowe i fakturowanie elektroniczne, nie byłyby w stanie działać.

Pliki cookie związane z wydajnością

Pliki cookie związane z wydajnością gromadzą informacje na temat korzystania z naszych Witryn internetowych, takie jak najczęściej przeglądane strony. Informacje te umożliwiają nam optymalizację naszych Witryn internetowych i uproszczenie przeglądania. Pliki cookie dotyczące wydajności umożliwiają również naszym spółkom stowarzyszonym i partnerom sprawdzenie, czy użytkownik uzyskał dostęp do jednej z naszych Witryn internetowych z ich witryny oraz czy wizyta użytkownika doprowadziła do skorzystania z lub zakupu Produktu bądź Usługi z naszych Witryn internetowych, włącznie z odniesieniami do zakupionych Produktów lub Usług. Wszystkie informacje gromadzone przez pliki cookie dotyczące wydajności są zagregowane, a więc również anonimowe.

Pliki cookie związane z funkcjonalnością

Pliki cookie związane z funkcjonalnością umożliwiają naszym Witrynom internetowym zapamiętywanie wyborów dokonanych przez użytkownika podczas przeglądania. Możemy na przykład przechowywać lokalizację geograficzną użytkownika w pliku cookie, aby wyświetlane były Witryny internetowe odpowiednie dla jego obszaru. Możemy również zapamiętać preferencje użytkownika, takie jak rozmiar tekstu, czcionka i inne konfigurowalne aspekty Witryn internetowych. Pliki cookie związane z funkcjonalnością mogą również śledzić przeglądane produkty lub filmy, aby uniknąć ich powtarzania. Informacje gromadzone przez te pliki cookie nie mogą być wykorzystywane do identyfikacji użytkownika i nie mogą monitorować jego aktywności w witrynach internetowych, które nie należą do nas. Funkcjonalne pliki cookie umożliwiają nam wyświetlanie w naszych Witrynach internetowych reklam dostosowanych do użytkownika, zrozumienie, które części naszych treści najbardziej go interesują oraz które kategorie produktów lub usług użytkownik zamawia. Niektórzy z naszych usługodawców mogą umieszczać pliki cookie w naszych Witrynach internetowych. Firmy te mogą również zapewnić użytkownikowi możliwość zapobiegania wykorzystywaniu plików cookie w przyszłości.

Użytkownik może w dowolnym momencie uniemożliwić lub zrezygnować z dalszego korzystania z niektórych plików cookie, aktywując odpowiednie ustawienie w przeglądarce, aby odmówić akceptacji plików cookie przeglądarki. Jednak w takim przypadku może to wpłynąć na korzystanie z naszych Witryn internetowych; np. użytkownik może nie mieć dostępu do niektórych części naszych Witryn internetowych. O ile użytkownik nie dostosował ustawień przeglądarki tak, aby odrzucała pliki cookie, nasz system będzie umieszczał pliki cookie na urządzeniu użytkownika po przekierowaniu przeglądarki na nasze Witryny internetowe.

Lokalne pliki cookie

Niektóre funkcje naszych Witryn internetowych mogą wykorzystywać lokalnie przechowywane obiekty (do gromadzenia i przechowywania informacji o preferencjach użytkownika i nawigacji do, z i na naszych Witrynach internetowych). Lokalne pliki cookie nie są zarządzane przez takie same ustawienia przeglądarki, jak w przypadku plików cookie przeglądarki.

Możemy również łączyć Dane osobowe, które gromadzimy od użytkownika poza naszymi Witrynami internetowymi albo Usługami z Danymi osobowymi, które są gromadzone za pośrednictwem naszych Witryn internetowych albo Usług albo w inny sposób, jak opisano powyżej.

1.5 INFORMACJE O URZĄDZENIU, SIECI, GEOLOKALIZACJI I POJEŹDZIE ELEKTRYCZNYM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gdy użytkownik odwiedza lub opuszcza nasze Witryny internetowe lub Usługi, klikając hiperłącze lub wyświetlając wtyczkę w witrynie internetowej podmiotu zewnętrznego, automatycznie otrzymujemy adres URL witryny, z której użytkownik przyszedł lub witryny, do której jest skierowany. Ponadto, gdy użytkownik kliknie reklamę, która może pojawić się w naszych Usługach, reklamodawcy otrzymują adres URL strony, na której znajduje się użytkownik. Otrzymujemy również adres protokołu internetowego („IP”) komputera użytkownika lub serwera proxy, z którego użytkownik korzysta do uzyskania dostępu do Internetu, szczegóły systemu operacyjnego komputera, rodzaj przeglądarki internetowej, informacje dotyczące urządzenia mobilnego użytkownika (w tym identyfikator urządzenia mobilnego dostarczony przez system operacyjny urządzenia mobilnego), informacje dotyczące mobilnego systemu operacyjnego użytkownika (jeśli użytkownik uzyskuje dostęp do naszych witryn internetowych lub usług za pomocą urządzenia mobilnego) oraz nazwę usługodawcy internetowego lub operatora sieci komórkowej użytkownika.

1.6 ANKIETY
-----------

My lub podmioty niepowiązane możemy przeprowadzać ankiety użytkowników dotyczące naszych Usług. Niektóre niepowiązane z nami podmioty mogą kierować do użytkownika reklamy lub promocje na podstawie jego odpowiedzi w ankiecie. My lub podmioty niepowiązane opracowujemy nowe programy lub produkty w oparciu o informacje, które użytkownik udostępnia w ankietach. Możemy korzystać z usług podmiotów niepowiązanych w ramach zapewnienia użytkownikowi zachęt finansowych lub innych celem skłonienia użytkownika do udziału w ankietach. Jeśli dostarczenie zachęt wymaga podania danych kontaktowych, użytkownik może zostać poproszony o podanie Danych osobowych niepowiązanemu podmiotowi realizującemu taką zachęcającą ofertę, które zostaną wykorzystane wyłącznie w celu dostarczenia obiecanych zachęt i weryfikacji jego danych kontaktowych. To od użytkownika zależy, czy przekaże on te informacje bądź czy chce skorzystać z takiej oferty. O zgodę użytkownika na wykorzystywanie jakichkolwiek Danych osobowych w celach określonych w ankiecie wyraźnie poprosi niepowiązany podmiot wykorzystujący te dane. Aby zrezygnować z naszych ankiet, użytkownik może przesłać do nas swoją prośbę, korzystając z poniższych danych kontaktowych.

2\. CHARAKTER I CEL PRZETWARZANIA DANYCH OSOBOWYCH

* dowolny cel, który opiszemy i na jaki uzyskamy zgodę użytkownika w chwili, gdy ten przekazuje informacje.

Używamy plików cookie, przezroczystych plików GIF i informacji o pliku dziennika aby: (a) zapamiętać informacje, aby nie trzeba było ich ponownie wprowadzać podczas wizyty lub przy następnej wizycie na Witrynach internetowych; (b) zapewnić spersonalizowane treści i informacje; (c) monitorować skuteczność naszych Usług; (d) monitorować wskaźniki zbiorcze, takie jak całkowita liczba odwiedzających, ruch uliczny i modele demograficzne; (e) diagnozować lub naprawiać problemy techniczne zgłaszane przez naszych użytkowników lub inżynierów, które są powiązane z określonymi adresami IP; i/lub (f) pomóc użytkownikowi w skutecznym dostępie do informacji po zalogowaniu.

Dane statystyczne, które gromadzimy automatycznie, pomagają nam ulepszać nasze Witryny internetowe i dostarczać lepsze i bardziej spersonalizowane Produkty i Usługi, w tym między innymi poprzez umożliwienie nam: określania naszych odbiorców/odwiedzających i wzorców użytkowania, przechowywania informacji o preferencjach użytkownika, umożliwiania nam dostosowywania i ulepszania naszych Witryn internetowych, przyspieszania wyszukiwania i/lub rozpoznawania użytkownika po powrocie na nasze Witryny internetowe.

Możemy gromadzić i wykorzystywać informacje dotyczące sesji ładowania pojazdów elektrycznych (np. czas ładowania, zużycie energii, właściciel stacji i dane itp.) oraz marki, modelu i roku pojazdu do zarządzania kontem użytkownika, na przykład w celu rozróżnienia wielu pojazdów lub użytkowników korzystających z jednego konta oraz w celach analitycznych.

W zakresie, w jakim użytkownik nie wyraża zgody na praktyki dotyczące przetwarzania informacji określone w niniejszym dokumencie, może mieć prawo do rezygnacji z takich praktyk. Wszystkie wnioski o rezygnację należy kierować na adres [\[email protected\]](https://company.plugshare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). W zakresie, w jakim wnioski o rezygnację są uznawane, będą miały wpływ na przyszłe przetwarzanie, a nie na przetwarzanie, które miało miejsce na podstawie uprzedniej zgody.

2.1 ZAUTOMATYZOWANE PODEJMOWANIE DECYZJI
----------------------------------------

Możemy wykorzystywać przekazane nam przez użytkownika Dane osobowe, które pozyskujemy z innych źródeł, aby lepiej zrozumieć jego zainteresowania, abyśmy mogli spróbować przewidzieć, jakie inne Produkty, Usługi i informacje mogą go najbardziej zainteresować. Praktyka ta polega na podejmowaniu zautomatyzowanych decyzji na podstawie tych informacji, aby lepiej dostosować nasze interakcje z użytkownikiem tak, aby były one bardziej dopasowane i interesujące. Użytkownikowi przysługuje prawo wnieść sprzeciw wobec tego działania w dowolnym momencie lub poprosić nas o więcej informacji na temat metodologii stosowanej w naszych zautomatyzowanych procesach podejmowania decyzji, kontaktując się z nami (patrz punkt 12 poniżej).

2.2 WIADOMOŚCI TEKSTOWE
-----------------------

Nasze Usługi mogą obejmować wysyłanie użytkownikowi wiadomości tekstowych („SMS”), co może obejmować dostarczanie użytkownikowi do dwóch wiadomości dziennie na jego urządzenie bezprzewodowe (chyba że użytkownik się z nami w tej sprawie skontaktuje), z zastrzeżeniem, że częstotliwość wysyłania wiadomości może się różnić.  Wyrażając zgodę na otrzymywanie od nas wiadomości tekstowych i podając numer telefonu komórkowego, użytkownik wyraża zgodę na otrzymywanie cyklicznych wiadomości informacyjnych i transakcyjnych od nas lub wysyłanych w naszym imieniu na podany przez użytkownika numer. Wyrażając zgodę na otrzymywanie od nas wiadomości SMS i podając swój numer telefonu komórkowego, użytkownik gwarantuje i oświadcza, że to on jest właścicielem określonego numeru telefonu. Możemy wykorzystywać dane użytkownika w celu kontaktowania się z nim w sprawie jego użytkowania, zakupów, zwrotów (jeśli są dostępne), aktualizacji dotyczących Witryn internetowych, przeprowadzania ankiet lub komunikatów informacyjnych i związanych z usługami, w tym ważnych aktualizacji bezpieczeństwa. Po wysłaniu do nas wiadomości SMS o treści „STOP” wyślemy użytkownikowi wiadomość SMS z potwierdzeniem anulowania subskrypcji. Użytkownik może też przesłać nam swoje żądanie pocztą elektroniczną, wysyłając wiadomość, w treści której należy pamiętać o umieszczeniu adresu e-mail i numeru telefonu podanego podczas rejestracji lub korzystając z innych uzasadnionych środków. Następnie użytkownik nie będzie już więcej otrzymywał od nas wiadomości SMS. W przypadku chęci ponownego dołączenia, użytkownik powinien zarejestrować się tak samo, jak zrobił to za pierwszym razem, a my zaczniemy wysyłać mu wiadomości SMS. Aby uzyskać pomoc, należy odpowiedzieć na dowolnego SMS-a wysyłając wiadomość o treści POMOC. W zależności od planu telefonii komórkowej mogą obowiązywać opłaty za wiadomości i dane. Operatorzy nie ponoszą odpowiedzialności za opóźnione lub niedostarczone wiadomości.

2.3 WTYCZKI MEDIÓW SPOŁECZNOŚCIOWYCH
------------------------------------

W Witrynach internetowych integrujemy interfejsy lub wtyczki programów mediów społecznościowych („Wtyczki”) z serwisów społecznościowych takich jak Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest i/lub ewentualnie innych firm. Dzięki temu użytkownik może mieć możliwość zarejestrowania się u nas logując się do swojego konta w serwisie Facebook lub na innym portalu społecznościowym.

Dla przykładu, gdy użytkownik odwiedza nasze Witryny internetowe, wtyczka tworzy bezpośrednie połączenie pomiędzy przeglądarką użytkownika a serwerem Facebook. Umożliwia to Facebookowi otrzymywanie informacji o wizycie użytkownika na naszych Witrynach internetowych z adresem IP użytkownika. Jeśli użytkownik kliknie przycisk „Lubię to” na Facebooku podczas logowania się do swojego konta na Facebooku, może połączyć zawartość naszych Witryn internetowych ze swoim profilem na Facebooku. Dzięki temu Facebook może przypisać wizytę użytkownika na naszych Witrynach internetowych do jego konta użytkownika. Należy pamiętać, że jako dostawca Witryn internetowych nie otrzymujemy powiadomienia o treści przesyłanych danych ani ich wykorzystaniu przez serwis Facebook. Jeśli użytkownik nie chce, aby serwis Facebook przypisał jego wizytę na naszych Witrynach internetowych do jego konta użytkownika serwisu Facebooka, należy wylogować się ze swojego konta użytkownika serwisu Facebook.

W przypadku logowania za pomocą wtyczki mediów społecznościowych, użytkownik upoważnia nas do dostępu do określonych informacji o koncie z danej strony mediów społecznościowych, takich jak profil użytkownika w mediach społecznościowych (zgodnie z ustawieniami prywatności w witrynie mediów społecznościowych), adres e-mail, zainteresowania, polubienia, płeć, urodziny, historia wykształcenia, relacje, zainteresowania, aktualne miasto, zdjęcia, osobisty opis, listy znajomych, oraz informacje o i zdjęcia znajomych ze strony użytkownika w mediach społecznościowych, którzy mogą być wspólnymi znajomymi innych użytkowników tego samego portalu. Wtyczki mogą przesyłać informacje o użytkowniku na odpowiednią platformę wtyczki bez podejmowania działań przez użytkownika. Informacje te mogą obejmować numer identyfikacyjny użytkownika platformy, stronę internetową, na której użytkownik się znajduje i inne informacje. Interakcja z Wtyczką spowoduje przesyłanie informacji bezpośrednio do sieci społecznościowej tej Wtyczki i informacje te mogą być widoczne dla innych osób na tej platformie. Wtyczki są kontrolowane przez politykę prywatności danej witryny mediów społecznościowych (dostępną na jej stronie internetowej), a nie przez naszą Politykę prywatności.

Możemy przechowywać Dane osobowe w miejscach pozostających poza naszą bezpośrednią kontrolą (na przykład na serwerach lub w bazach danych zlokalizowanych w całości lub częściowo u Usługodawców świadczących usługi hostingu danych).  

3.3 REKLAMA BEHAWIORALNA O RÓŻNYCH KONTEKSTACH
----------------------------------------------

Jesteśmy zobowiązani do ujawnienia, czy udostępniamy Dane osobowe stronie trzeciej, która jest zaangażowana w (ukierunkowane) reklamy behawioralne o różnych kontekstach. W ciągu ostatnich dwunastu (12) miesięcy ujawniliśmy lub mogliśmy ujawnić następujące kategorie Danych osobowych w kontekście, który na mocy pewnych przepisów prawa (np. CPRA, RODO lub RODO w Wielkiej Brytanii) może być uznany za sprzedaż:

* identyfikatory;
* aktywność w Internecie lub innej podobnej sieci;
* dane geolokalizacyjne;

Użytkownik może zrezygnować z bycia uwzględnionym w takich ujawnieniach, klikając monity o rezygnację, które pojawią się w powiadomieniu, które użytkownik otrzymuje podczas pierwszej wizyty w naszych aplikacjach mobilnych lub Witrynach internetowych.

Użytkownik przyjmuje do wiadomości (i nie będzie sprzeciwiać się) naszemu ujawnieniu lub przekazaniu jego Danych osobowych, Danych osobowych pozbawionych elementów umożliwiających ustalenie tożsamości oraz innych informacji, które użytkownik nam przekazuje, jak również praw przyznanych lub potwierdzonych przez użytkownika w niniejszej Polityce prywatności (łącznie „Przekazywane informacje”) potencjalnemu lub faktycznemu nabywcy naszej firmy lub ją przejmującemu lub innemu następcy w celu rozważenia lub przeprowadzenia fuzji, zbycia, restrukturyzacji, reorganizacji, rozwiązania, zmiany kontroli lub przeniesienia części lub całości naszych aktywów (każde z powyższych zwane jest „Przekazaniem informacji”), czy to w ramach dalszego prowadzenia działalności, czy to w związku z upadłością, likwidacją lub innym postępowaniem sądowym, w którym przechowywane przez nas Dane osobowe znajdują się wśród przekazywanych aktywów, i zobowiązuje się nie sprzeciwiać takiemu ujawnieniu i/lub przekazaniu. Nie możemy składać żadnych oświadczeń dotyczących wykorzystywania lub przekazywania Przekazywanych informacji, które możemy mieć w przypadku naszej upadłości, reorganizacji, niewypłacalności, ustanowienia zarządcy komisarycznego lub cesji na rzecz wierzycieli. Ponadto, z wyjątkiem przypadków wymaganych przez prawo, nie ponosimy i nie będziemy ponosić odpowiedzialności za jakiekolwiek naruszenie bezpieczeństwa przez jakiekolwiek niepowiązane strony ani za żadne działania jakichkolwiek niepowiązanych stron, które otrzymują jakiekolwiek Przekazywane informacje, które zostały nam ujawnione.

3.5 WYMAGANE UJAWNIENIA; OCHRONA PRAW; BEZPIECZEŃSTWO
-----------------------------------------------------

O ile niniejsza Polityka prywatności nie stanowi inaczej, nie ujawnimy Państwa Danych osobowych żadnej stronie niepowiązanej, chyba że będzie to wymagane przez prawo, nakaz sądowy, proces prawny (np. wezwanie sądowe), w tym, ale nie tylko, aby odpowiedzieć na jakiekolwiek wezwanie ze strony organu rządowego, regulacyjnego bądź udzielającego licencji/pozwoleń, lub jeśli uważamy, że takie działanie jest niezbędne do: (a) przestrzegania przepisów prawa, przestrzegania procedur prawnych dotyczących nas lub naszych podmiotów stowarzyszonych, spółek zależnych, zakontraktowanych dostawców lub powiązanych partnerów, lub dochodzenia, zapobiegania lub podejmowania działań w odniesieniu do podejrzewanych lub faktycznych działań niezgodnych z prawem; (b) egzekwowania naszych Warunków lub umowy z klientem (w tym w celach rozliczeniowych i windykacyjnych); (c) podejmowania środków ostrożności w zakresie odpowiedzialności; (d) dochodzenia i obrony przed roszczeniami lub zarzutami osób trzecich; (e) pomocy rządowym organom ścigania lub spełnienia krajowych lub innych rządowych wymogów bezpieczeństwa; (f) ochrony bezpieczeństwa lub integralności naszych Witryn internetowych, Usług i Aplikacji mobilnych; lub (g) wykonywania lub ochrony praw, nieruchomości lub bezpieczeństwa osobistego, naszych użytkowników lub innych osób. 

W miarę możliwości postaramy się powiadomić użytkownika o takich żądaniach, chyba że: (i) powiadomienie jest zabronione przez sam proces prawny, na podstawie nakazu sądowego, który otrzymujemy lub na mocy obowiązującego prawa lub (ii) uważamy, że powiadomienie byłoby bezsensowne, nieskuteczne, stwarzałoby ryzyko obrażeń ciała lub innych szkód dla osoby lub grupy, lub stworzyło lub zwiększyło ryzyko oszustwa wobec nas, naszych użytkowników, naszych Witryn internetowych, Usług lub aplikacji mobilnych. W przypadkach, w których będziemy spełniać żądania prawne bez powiadomienia z tych powodów, postaramy się powiadomić tego użytkownika o żądaniu po fakcie, jeśli w dobrej wierze stwierdzimy, że nie mamy już prawnego zakazu takiego działania i nie mają zastosowania żadne scenariusze ryzyka opisane w niniejszym paragrafie.

3.6 UJAWNIANIE ZANONIMIZOWANYCH DANYCH OSOBOWYCH
------------------------------------------------

Możemy udostępniać Dane osobowe pozbawione elementów umożliwiających ustalenie tożsamości (w tym w szczególności anonimowe dane dotyczące użytkowania, strony i adresy URL odsyłające/wyjściowe, adres IP, rodzaje platform, liczba kliknięć itp.) stronom niepowiązanym w dowolny sposób i w dowolnym celu, na przykład: w celu administrowania systemem i monitorowania korzystania z Witryn internetowych; w celu pomiaru liczby wizyt na naszych Witrynach internetowych, średniego czasu poświęconego na korzystanie z nich, liczby wyświetlanych stron; oraz monitorowania różnych innych statystyk Witryny internetowej w celu poprawy treści.

4\.  POLECENIA „NIE ŚLEDŹ”
==========================

Niektóre przeglądarki internetowe (w tym Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox i Chrome) posiadają funkcję „Nie śledź” („Do Not Track, DNT”) lub podobną, która sygnalizuje witrynom internetowym, że użytkownik nie życzy sobie, aby jego aktywność i zachowanie w Internecie były śledzone. Jeżeli witryna internetowa odpowiadająca na określony sygnał DNT otrzyma sygnał DNT, przeglądarka może zablokować gromadzenie przez tę witrynę pewnych informacji o użytkowniku przeglądarki. Nie wszystkie przeglądarki oferują opcję DNT, a polecenia DNT nie są jeszcze jednolite. Z tego powodu wielu operatorów stron internetowych, w tym PlugShare, nie reaguje na sygnały DNT.

5\. WIADOMOŚCI PLUGSHARE, PREFERENCJE I REZYGNACJA
==================================================

Przekazując nam swój adres e-mail, użytkownik wyraża zgodę na wykorzystywanie przez nas adresu e-mail do wysyłania powiadomień związanych z Usługą pocztą elektroniczną, w tym między innymi wszelkich powiadomień wymaganych przez prawo (np. powiadomienia o prywatności danych lub incydentach związanych z bezpieczeństwem), zamiast komunikacji pocztą tradycyjną. Użytkownik zgadza się również, że możemy wysyłać mu powiadomienia o aktywności dotyczącej naszych Produktów, Usług, Witryn internetowych, aplikacji mobilnych, Danych osobowych użytkownika lub dowolnego aspektu naszej relacji na podany przez niego adres e-mail, zgodnie z obowiązującymi ustawieniami prywatności. Możemy wykorzystywać adres e-mail użytkownika do wysyłania mu innych wiadomości lub treści, takich jak m.in. newslettery, dodatki lub zmiany w funkcjach Usługi lub oferty specjalne. Jeśli użytkownik nie życzy sobie otrzymywać takich wiadomości e-mail, może z nich zrezygnować, klikając opcję Anuluj subskrypcję tam, gdzie jest ona dostępna. Rezygnacja może uniemożliwić otrzymywanie wiadomości e-mail dotyczących aktualizacji, ulepszeń, specjalnych funkcji, ogłoszeń lub ofert. Użytkownik nie może zrezygnować z otrzymywania wiadomości e-mail związanych z Usługą. Jeśli użytkownik zdecydował się nie przekazywać nam adresu e-mail ani innego adresu, może nie otrzymywać wiadomości e-mail związanych z Usługą.

Za pośrednictwem strony ustawień konta użytkownika użytkownik może uzyskać dostęp do określonych informacji, które nam przekazał, takich jak imię i nazwisko, hasło, adres e-mail, adres, informacje o profilu użytkownika itp., a w niektórych przypadkach może je edytować lub usuwać. Informacje, które użytkownik może przeglądać, aktualizować i usuwać, mogą ulec zmianie wraz ze zmianą Produktów, Witryn internetowych, Usług lub naszych praktyk. W razie jakichkolwiek pytań dotyczących przeglądania lub aktualizowania informacji, które posiadamy na temat użytkownika, prosimy o kontakt. Jednak w przypadku aktualizacji informacji możemy zachować kopię niepoprawionych informacji w naszej dokumentacji. Użytkownik może zażądać usunięcia swojego konta, wysyłając do nas wiadomość e-mail. Obowiązkiem użytkownika jest zachowanie u nas aktualnego adresu e-mail. W zależności od stanu lub kraju zamieszkania użytkownika mogą przysługiwać mu dodatkowe prawa. Więcej informacji znajduje się poniżej.

6\. PROGRAMIŚCI KORZYSTAJĄCY Z USŁUG PLATFORMY PLUGSHARE
========================================================

Współpracujemy z podmiotami zewnętrznymi i umożliwiamy im korzystanie z platformy programistycznej PlugShare w celu oferowania usług i funkcjonalności w połączeniu z PlugShare. Ci zewnętrzni programiści wynegocjowali umowę dotyczącą korzystania z technologii platformy PlugShare lub zgodzili się na stosowanie przez nas samoobsługowych interfejsów programowania aplikacji („API”) i warunków dotyczących wtyczek z myślą o tworzeniu aplikacji platformy oprogramowania („Aplikacje platformy”). Zarówno wynegocjowane umowy, jak i nasze API i warunki korzystania z wtyczek zawierają ograniczenia dotyczące tego, w jaki sposób podmioty zewnętrzne mogą uzyskiwać dostęp, przechowywać i wykorzystywać Dane osobowe przekazane przez użytkownika PlugShare. Jeśli użytkownik zdecyduje się korzystać z Aplikacji platformy, zostanie poproszony o potwierdzenie akceptacji polityki prywatności i zgody użytkownika zewnętrznego dewelopera. Aby wycofać pozwolenie na korzystanie z Aplikacji platformy, należy przejść do ustawień. Należy jednak pamiętać, że nawet po wycofaniu zgody na korzystanie z Aplikacji platformy, osoby powiązane z użytkownikiem będą mogły nadal korzystać z Aplikacji platformy, więc Aplikacja platformy może nadal mieć dostęp do pewnych informacji na temat użytkownika, takich jak osoby z nim powiązane.

7\. PRZECHOWYWANIE DANYCH OSOBOWYCH
===================================

Okres, przez jaki przechowujemy Dane osobowe użytkownika, zależy od celów, dla których je wykorzystujemy. Będziemy przechowywać Dane osobowe użytkownika tak długo, jak jego konto będzie aktywne, tak długo, jak użytkownik jest zarejestrowanym posiadaczem konta lub użytkownikiem naszych Usług, lub tak długo, jak mamy w tym inny cel biznesowy (np. między innymi cele biznesowe, podatkowe lub prawne), a następnie nie dłużej niż jest to wymagane lub dozwolone przez prawo lub naszą politykę przechowywania dokumentacji, w uzasadnionym zakresie niezbędnym do celów wewnętrznej sprawozdawczości i uzgadniania bądź aby przekazać użytkownikowi informacje zwrotne lub informacje, o które użytkownik może prosić. Taki okres przechowywania podlega naszej weryfikacji i zmianom. Możemy przechowywać Dane osobowe pozbawione elementów umożliwiających ustalenie tożsamości tak długo, jak uznamy to za stosowne.

Po zamknięciu lub dezaktywacji konta użytkownika możemy zachować informacje o profilu użytkownika i wszystkie informacje opublikowane w publicznych obszarach Witryn internetowych. Po zamknięciu lub dezaktywacji konta użytkownika możemy zachować Dane osobowe i inne dane użytkownika, ale będziemy je traktować jako poufne zgodnie z Warunkami, niniejszą Polityką prywatności i zgodnie z wymogami obowiązującego prawa. Mamy prawo usunąć wszystkie Dane osobowe i inne dane użytkownika po zamknięciu konta użytkownika bez powiadomienia użytkownika.

8\. NIE GROMADZIMY CELOWO DANYCH DZIECI
=======================================

Nie gromadzimy, nie zabiegamy ani nie przechowujemy świadomie Danych osobowych osób poniżej 18. roku życia ani nie zezwalamy takim osobom na rejestrację lub korzystanie z naszych Usług. Jeśli użytkownik nie ma jeszcze ukończonych 18 lat, nie należy przesyłać nam żadnych Danych osobowych. W przypadku, gdy dowiemy się, że zebraliśmy Dane osobowe od dziecka poniżej 18. roku życia bez weryfikacji zgody rodziców, dołożymy wszelkich starań uzasadnionych z biznesowego punktu widzenia, aby usunąć te informacje z naszej bazy danych.

9\. GDZIE PRZETWARZAMY I PRZECHOWUJEMY DANE OSOBOWE; OBOWIĄZUJĄCE PRAWO WŁAŚCIWE
================================================================================

Nasza siedziba główna znajduje się w Stanach Zjednoczonych. Gromadzone przez nas lub naszych Usługodawców Dane osobowe mogą być przechowywane i przetwarzane na serwerach na terenie lub poza terenem Stanów Zjednoczonych oraz na całym świecie wszędzie tam, gdzie my i nasi Usługodawcy posiadamy placówki, a dostęp do niektórych informacji mogą mieć osoby lub firmy spoza Stanów Zjednoczonych, które świadczą dla nas usługi. Użytkownik wyraża zgodę na przekazywanie swoich Danych osobowych przez nas i naszych Usługodawców do jurysdykcji, które mogą nie zapewniać takiego samego poziomu ochrony danych jak kraj zamieszkania użytkownika lub na uzyskiwanie do nich dostępu w takich jurysdykcjach. Podejmiemy uzasadnione kroki w celu zapewnienia, że Dane osobowe użytkownika otrzymają odpowiedni poziom ochrony w jurysdykcjach, w których je przetwarzamy.

Przepisy prawa Stanów Zjednoczonych mają zastosowanie, o ile użytkownik jest mieszkańcem Stanów Zjednoczonych. W przeciwnym razie niniejsza Polityka prywatności i wszystkie inne kwestie będą interpretowane zgodnie z przepisami prawa prowincji/stanu i federalnego jurysdykcji, w której mieszka użytkownik. Jurysdykcje poza miejscem zamieszkania użytkownika mogą mieć inne przepisy dotyczące ochrony prywatności niż te, które obowiązują w miejscu zamieszkania użytkownika, włącznie z prawem do dostępu do Danych osobowych przez organy ścigania i organy rządowe.  W zakresie, w jakim przetwarzamy dane poza krajem zamieszkania użytkownika, przeprowadzamy ocenę wpływu na prywatność w celu ustalenia, czy nasi Usługodawcy mogą zapewnić zasadniczo taki sam poziom ochrony, jaki jest wymagany w jurysdykcji użytkownika oraz zawieramy umowy w celu dalszego wzmocnienia zobowiązań do odpowiedniego przetwarzania Danych osobowych użytkownika.

10\. BEZPIECZEŃSTWO
===================

Wdrożyliśmy techniczne i organizacyjne zabezpieczenia mające na celu ochronę Danych osobowych użytkownika przed przypadkową utratą oraz nieuprawnionym dostępem, wykorzystaniem, zniszczeniem, zmianą i ujawnieniem. Należy jednak pamiętać, że Internet nie jest w 100% bezpiecznym środowiskiem. Obowiązkiem użytkownika jest ochrona bezpieczeństwa danych logowania, zachowanie ostrożności podczas przesyłania Danych osobowych za pośrednictwem wiadomości e-mail, komunikatorów internetowych i podobnych środków komunikacji oraz stosowanie dobrych praktyk w zakresie bezpieczeństwa w Internecie. Nigdy nie wyślemy użytkownikowi wiadomości e-mail z prośbą o podanie hasła lub innych danych logowania do konta. W przypadku otrzymania takiej wiadomości e-mail, należy wysłać ją do nas, abyśmy mogli przeprowadzić dochodzenie.

11\. DODATKOWE PRAWA OSÓB, KTÓRYCH DANE DOTYCZĄ, DLA MIESZKAŃCÓW NIEKTÓRYCH JURYSDYKCJI OPISANYCH W DODATKOWYCH INFORMACJACH O OCHRONIE PRYWATNOŚCI

=========================================================================

Jeśli użytkownik jest mieszkańcem stanu Kalifornia, Wirginia, Kolorado, Utah lub Connecticut (czasami określanych w niniejszym dokumencie jako „Konsument”), przepisy stanowe zapewniają użytkownikowi dodatkowe prawa dotyczące wykorzystywania przez nas jego Danych osobowych.

KALIFORNIJSKI PRZEPIS „SHINE THE LIGHT”
---------------------------------------

Artykuł 1798.83 Kodeksu cywilnego stanu Kalifornia, znany jako przepis „Shine The Light”, zezwala wszystkim użytkownikom będącym mieszkańcami stanu Kalifornia na żądanie i uzyskanie od nas listy Danych osobowych (jeśli dotyczy) ujawnionych stronom trzecim w celach marketingu bezpośredniego w poprzednim roku kalendarzowym oraz nazw i adresów tych stron trzecich. Wnioski można składać tylko raz w roku i są one bezpłatne.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CalOPPA ma zastosowanie wyłącznie do firm, które gromadzą Dane osobowe mieszkańców stanu Kalifornia.

1. JAK REAGUJEMY NA POLECENIA „NIE ŚLEDŹ”.

Niektóre przeglądarki internetowe wysyłają sygnały „nie śledź” (DNT/GPC) do witryn internetowych i innych usług online, z którymi komunikuje się przeglądarka użytkownika. Obecnie nie istnieje żadna norma, która określałby, co ewentualnie witryny internetowe powinny robić po otrzymaniu takich sygnałów; aktualnie posiadamy mechanizmy umożliwiające podjęcie działań w odpowiedzi na takie sygnały.

2. ŚLEDZENIE ZACHOWAŃ OSÓB TRZECICH

Możemy również wykorzystywać te technologie do gromadzenia informacji na temat aktywności użytkownika w Internecie w czasie i na stronach internetowych podmiotów zewnętrznych lub w innych usługach internetowych, lub do kojarzenia Danych osobowych z innymi informacjami zebranymi w ten sposób. Możemy wykorzystywać dane osobowe do śledzenia wzorców klikania i przeglądania użytkowników.

Użytkownik ma prawo do rezygnacji ze sprzedaży lub licencjonowania tych kategorii danych osobowych podmiotom niepowiązanym.

EGZEKWOWANIE PRAW
-----------------

Aby skorzystać z opisanych wyżej praw do uzyskania dostępu, korekty, przeniesienia i usunięcia danych, należy przesłać wniosek za pośrednictwem naszego formularza internetowego dostępnego [tutaj](https://company.plugshare.com/privacy-notice.html#data-form). Tylko użytkownik albo osoba upoważniona do działania w jego imieniu może wysłać wniosek dotyczący Danych osobowych użytkownika. Użytkownik może również złożyć wniosek Konsumenta w imieniu swojego niepełnoletniego dziecka. Jeśli otrzymamy od osoby wniosek dotyczący skorzystania z praw w imieniu użytkownika, poprosimy o przedstawienie podpisanej zgody użytkownika upoważniającej do składania takich wniosków w imieniu użytkownika i skontaktujemy się z użytkownikiem, aby bezpośrednio potwierdzić takie upoważnienia. Użytkownik może złożyć wniosek Konsumenta dotyczący dostępu do danych lub ich przeniesienia tylko dwa razy w ciągu 12 miesięcy. Możliwy do weryfikacji wniosek Klienta musi:

* uwzględniać wystarczającą ilość informacji, by pozwolić nam w uzasadniony sposób zweryfikować, czy użytkownik jest osobą, której dane osobowe zgromadziliśmy lub czy upoważniony przedstawiciel złożył wniosek;
* opisywać wniosek wystarczająco szczegółowo, by pozwolić nam właściwie zrozumieć, ocenić i odpowiedzieć na niego.

Nie możemy odpowiedzieć na wniosek użytkownika ani przekazać mu Danych osobowych, jeżeli nie będziemy w stanie zweryfikować jego tożsamości ani upoważnienia do złożenia wniosku i potwierdzenia, że Dane osobowe faktycznie odnoszą się do użytkownika. Składanie wniosku Konsumenta nie wymaga utworzenia u nas konta. Będziemy wykorzystywać Dane osobowe podane we wniosku Konsumenta wyłącznie w celu weryfikacji tożsamości lub upoważnienia wnioskodawcy do złożenia żądania.

Aby skorzystać z prawa do rezygnacji z reklam behawioralnych o różnych kontekstach, reklam ukierunkowanych lub udostępniania Danych osobowych w sposób opisany powyżej, należy dokonać rezygnacji w sposób zależny platformy, z której użytkownik korzysta.  Należy pamiętać, że wniosek związany z rezygnacją dotyczy konkretnego urządzenia i platformy, za pośrednictwem których użytkownik przesyła takie żądanie, dlatego jeśli użytkownik zamierza zrezygnować z konkretnych czynności przetwarzania na wielu urządzeniach i platformach konieczne może być wysłanie wielu wniosków. Należy kliknąć:

* [tutaj, aby zrezygnować w witrynie Plugshare.com (platforma internetowa)](#)
* [tutaj, aby zrezygnować w aplikacji Plugshare w systemie iOS](plugshare://ad-preferences)
* [tutaj, aby zrezygnować w aplikacji Plugshare w systemie Android](plugshare://ad-preferences)

### Proces weryfikacji

Po otrzymaniu od użytkownika możliwego do weryfikacji wniosku o uzyskanie dostępu do danych lub usunięcia danych, w ciągu 10 dni roboczych wyślemy użytkownikowi wiadomość e-mail na adres zapisany w jego dokumentacji. W wiadomości e-mail użytkownik zostanie poproszony o udzielenie odpowiedzi w celu weryfikacji użytkownika jako konsumenta składającego wniosek. Po otrzymaniu weryfikacji użytkownika dopasujemy dane użytkownika do danych znajdujących się w naszej dokumentacji. Po weryfikacji tożsamości użytkownika będziemy kontynuować przetwarzanie wniosku i udzielimy odpowiedzi w ciągu 45 dni kalendarzowych, chyba że (a) nie będziemy w stanie zweryfikować wniosku użytkownika, (b) nie będziemy w stanie dopasować użytkownika do informacji zawartych w naszej bazie danych lub (c) istnieje wyjątek prawny, który zwalnia nas z obowiązku wypełniania postulatów wniosku użytkownika. Jeśli będziemy potrzebować więcej czasu (maksymalnie do dodatkowych czterdziestu pięciu (45) dni kalendarzowych), poinformujemy użytkownika na piśmie o przyczynie i okresie przedłużenia.

Jeśli nie będziemy w stanie spełnić żądania użytkownika, udzielona przez nas odpowiedź będzie zawierać odpowiednie wyjaśnienie. W przypadku wniosków o przeniesienie danych, do samego przekazania takich Danych osobowych użytkownikowi wybierzemy format który jest łatwy w użyciu i który umożliwi użytkownikowi przesłanie tych informacji z jednego podmiotu do innego bez przeszkód.

Nie pobieramy opłat za rozpatrzenie i udzielenie odpowiedzi na możliwe do zweryfikowania wnioski Konsumenta, chyba że są one nadmierne, powtarzalne lub ewidentnie bezpodstawne. Jeśli stwierdzimy, że w związku z wnioskiem należna jest opłata, poinformujemy użytkownika, dlaczego podjęliśmy tę decyzję i przedstawimy szacunkowe koszty przed rozpatrzeniem wniosku.

1. ### WYRAŹNA ZGODA UŻYTKOWNIKA NA PRZETWARZANIE „WRAŻLIWYCH” DANYCH OSOBOWYCH LUB DANYCH OSOBOWYCH „SZCZEGÓLNYCH” KATEGORII
    

Zgodnie z przepisami dotyczącymi prywatności obowiązującymi w niektórych krajach niektóre rodzaje Danych osobowych są uznawane za informacje „wrażliwe” lub informacje „szczególnych” kategorii. Rzadko przetwarzamy dane wrażliwe lub dane szczególnych kategorii, chyba że leży to w istotnym interesie użytkownika lub interesie innej osoby. We wszystkich innych okolicznościach użytkownik wyraźnie zgadza się na gromadzenie, przetwarzanie i przechowywanie przez nas wrażliwych Danych osobowych lub Danych osobowych szczególnych kategorii zgodnie z opisem ujętym w ustępie 1.2 naszej głównej Polityki prywatności i wyraża zgodę na przetwarzanie Danych osobowych zgodnie z niniejszą Informacją o ochronie prywatności.  

2. ### NASZE PODSTAWY PRAWNE PRZETWARZANIA DANYCH OSOBOWYCH
    

Nasze podstawy prawne gromadzenia i wykorzystywania przez nas Danych osobowych opisanych powyżej będą zależeć od poszczególnych Danych osobowych oraz konkretnego kontekstu, w jakim je gromadzimy. Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, będziemy gromadzić i przetwarzać Dane osobowe użytkownika tylko wtedy, gdy będziemy potrzebować Danych osobowych do świadczenia użytkownikowi Usług, w związku z którymi użytkownik zawarł z nami umowę lub gdy przetwarzanie leży w naszym prawnie uzasadnionym interesie i nie jest nadrzędne wobec interesów użytkownika w zakresie ochrony danych ani podstawowych praw i wolności, a ponadto będziemy polegać na zgodzie użytkownika, we wszystkich sytuacjach, w których jesteśmy do tego prawnie zobowiązani. W niektórych przypadkach możemy również mieć prawny obowiązek gromadzenia Danych osobowych od użytkownika lub w inny sposób możemy potrzebować Danych osobowych w celu ochrony żywotnych interesów użytkownika lub innej osoby.

PODSTAWA PRAWNIE UZASADNIONEGO INTERESU GROMADZENIA DANYCH OSOBOWYCH: Gromadzenie i przetwarzanie Danych osobowych użytkownika może być konieczne do celów naszych uzasadnionych interesów. Takie uzasadnione cele mogą obejmować:

* zapobieganie oszustwom;
* zapewnienie bezpieczeństwa sieci i informacji;
* wskazywanie możliwych działań przestępczych lub zagrożeń dla bezpieczeństwa publicznego, w tym zwiększenie ochrony naszej społeczności przed spamem, nękaniem, naruszeniem własności intelektualnej, przestępstwami i zagrożeniami bezpieczeństwa wszelkiego rodzaju oraz egzekwowanie roszczeń prawnych, w tym dochodzenie potencjalnych naruszeń naszych Warunków użytkowania;
* spełnianie naszych zobowiązań prawnych;
* przetwarzanie danych pracownika lub gościa, członka, uczestnika lub osoby rejestrującej;
* wykonywanie funkcji lub usługi, o którą użytkownik prosił;
* świadczenie naszych Usług i ich funkcjonalność, gdy takie przetwarzanie jest niezbędne do celów uzasadnionych interesów realizowanych przez nas lub przez naszych usługodawców związanych z Usługami;
* marketing bezpośredni;
* prowadzenie z użytkownikiem odpowiedniej i stosownej relacji;
* analizy, np. oceny liczby odwiedzających, liczby wyświetleń stron, korzystania z Witryn internetowych itp. w celu zrozumienia sposobu korzystania z naszych Witryn internetowych, Produktów i Usług, optymalizacji Witryn internetowych i/lub przyszłej komunikacji oraz opracowywania nowych usług i funkcji Witryny internetowej;
* aktualizacje informacji i preferencji;
* oferowanie i ulepszanie naszych Witryn internetowych, Produktów i Usług;
* egzekwowanie roszczeń prawnych, w tym badanie potencjalnych naruszeń naszych Warunków.

Oprócz informacji podanych powyżej, poniższe postanowienia dotyczą wyłącznie mieszkańców lub obywateli omawianego kraju lub regionu. Na potrzeby poniższych postanowień, o ile nie wskazano inaczej, definicja „Danych osobowych” wykorzystywana powyżej będzie mieć taką samą definicję, co informacje osobowe, dane osobowe lub podobny termin, zgodnie z przepisami o ochronie danych obowiązującymi w danym kraju lub regionie. W przypadku i w zakresie sprzeczności między poniższymi a powyższymi postanowieniami, znaczenie nadrzędne mają postanowienia znajdujące się poniżej.

RODO – INFORMACJA O OCHRONIE PRYWATNOŚCI DLA MIESZKAŃCÓW EUROPEJSKIEGO OBSZARU GOSPODARCZEGO (EEA), WIELKIEJ BRYTANII I SZWAJCARII
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ### INFORMACJE OGÓLNE
    

Poniższe postanowienia mają zastosowanie tylko wobec mieszkańców EOG, Wielkiej Brytanii lub Szwajcarii (zwanych w niniejszym punkcie dla wygody „Rejonem UE”).

W przypadku takich rezydentów przetwarzanie Danych osobowych użytkownika odbywa się zgodnie z prawami i przepisami dotyczącymi prywatności, w szczególności (UE) 2016/679 Parlamentu Europejskiego i Rady z dnia 27 kwietnia 2016 r., zwanymi Ogólnym rozporządzeniem o ochronie danych lub Ogólnym rozporządzeniem o ochronie danych w Wielkiej Brytanii dla mieszkańców Wielkiej Brytanii (łącznie „RODO”) i wszelkie wykonywane przez nas przetwarzanie będzie zgodne z postanowieniami RODO. Na potrzeby RODO pełnimy funkcję „administratora” Danych osobowych (określanych i zdefiniowanych w RODO (dostępne [tutaj](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/)) jako „dane osobowe”), które gromadzimy, chyba że gromadzimy takie informacje w imieniu „administratora danych”, w którym to przypadku będziemy pełnić funkcję „podmiotu przetwarzającego dane”. Niniejsza Polityka prywatności nie dotyczy witryn internetowych, aplikacji ani usług, które nie wyświetlają niniejszej Polityki prywatności ani nie łączą się z nią, ani też wyświetlają lub zawierają łącza do innej polityki prywatności. Tylko w przypadku mieszkańców i obywateli regionu UE, w zakresie, w jakim jakakolwiek definicja w niniejszej Polityce prywatności jest sprzeczna z definicją zawartą w RODO, znaczenie nadrzędne ma definicja RODO.

Zapewniamy odpowiednią ochronę w przypadku przekazywania Danych osobowych do krajów spoza regionu UE za pomocą jednej lub kilku z następujących metod: (a) serii umów zawieranych pomiędzy firmami opartych na Standardowych klauzulach umownych lub zawierających te Standardowe klauzule umowne; (b) możemy polegać na decyzjach Komisji Europejskiej stwierdzających odpowiedni stopień ochrony dotyczących niektórych krajów, w stosownych przypadkach; (c) możemy uzyskać zgodę użytkownika na takie przekazywanie danych z regionu UE do Stanów Zjednoczonych i innych krajów; (d) możemy przyjąć wiążące reguły korporacyjne; lub (e) w odpowiednim zakresie, możemy polegać na odstępstwach określonych w art. 49 RODO w zakresie przekazywania i dalszego przekazywania Danych osobowych zebranych od osób fizycznych w regionie UE do Stanów Zjednoczonych i innych krajów, które w regionie UE nie uchodzą za zapewniające odpowiednią ochronę danych. Jeśli chodzi o metodę (e), możemy przekazywać Dane osobowe stronie trzeciej w celu wykonania umowy z użytkownikiem, za jego wyraźną zgodą lub w sposób, który nie narusza jego praw i wolności. Jeśli te Dane osobowe nie będą przetwarzane i przekazywane, nie będziemy w stanie zawrzeć z użytkownikiem umowy lub użytkownik nie będzie mieć dostępu do żadnych korzyści i funkcji związanych z jego transakcją.

Możemy również być zmuszeni do przekazania danych użytkownika innym firmom należącym do grupy lub usługodawcom w krajach spoza regionu UE. Może to nastąpić, jeśli nasze serwery lub dostawcy i usługodawcy znajdują się poza regionem UE lub jeśli użytkownik korzysta z naszych Produktów i/lub Usług znajdując się w krajach poza tym obszarem.

Nasze podstawy prawne do gromadzenia Danych osobowych omówiono w .

* Prawo do złożenia skargi.

1. ### POWIADOMIENIE DLA MIESZKAŃCÓW ARGENTYNY
    

Techniczne i organizacyjne środki bezpieczeństwa wdrożone przez PlugShare będą również wspierać zasady określone w art. 25.326 argentyńskiej Ustawy o ochronie danych osobowych (Personal Data Protection Act, PDPA), takie jak zakaz wszelkiego wtórnego wykorzystywania danych osobowych osób, których dane dotyczą, oraz zakaz przekazywania danych osobowych do krajów, które nie zapewniają odpowiedniego poziomu ochrony. Firma PlugShare wykorzystuje umowę o przekazywaniu/przetwarzaniu danych w celu zapewnienia zgodności z postanowieniami PDPA 60-E/2016, która reguluje przekazywanie danych osobowych przez granice.

Mieszkańcy Argentyny mają: (a) prawo do bycia poinformowanym(-ą) na temat istnienia i celu takich Danych osobowych; oraz (b) prawo do korekty i prawo do ograniczenia lub wniesienia sprzeciwu wobec przetwarzania Danych osobowych, jeśli są one fałszywe, niedokładne lub dyskryminujące.

2. ### POWIADOMIENIE DLA MIESZKAŃCÓW AUSTRALII
    

Możemy wykorzystywać i ujawniać Dane osobowe użytkownika (zgodnie z definicją zawartą w przepisach prawa australijskiego) stronom trzecim z siedzibą poza Australią, głównie w Stanach Zjednoczonych, zgodnie z opisem zawartym w ustępie 9 naszej głównej Polityki prywatności. Użytkownik zgadza się i przyjmuje do wiadomości, że odbiorcy zagraniczni będą podlegać przepisom o ochronie prywatności obowiązującym w ich lokalnej jurysdykcji i nie mogą podlegać żadnym zobowiązaniom dotyczącym ochrony prywatności ani żadnym zasadom podobnym do australijskich Zasad ochrony prywatności. Tacy odbiorcy będą również podlegać prawu zagranicznemu, które może wymusić ujawnienie Danych osobowych stronie trzeciej, takiej jak organ zagraniczny. O ile użytkownik nie powiadomi nas na piśmie o podjęciu przeciwstawnej decyzji, zostanie poproszony o wyrażenie zgody na ujawnienie przez nas Danych osobowych odbiorcom zagranicznym. Użytkownik ma możliwość zachowania anonimowości w kontaktach z nami lub nieujawniania nam określonych Danych osobowych. Może to jednak oznaczać, że możemy nie być w stanie świadczyć użytkownikowi naszych Usług.

W przypadku mieszkańców Australii aktualizacje niniejszej Polityki prywatności wchodzą w życie, jeśli uzyskamy wyraźną zgodę użytkownika lub jeśli zapewnimy możliwość rezygnacji w chwili ogłaszania istotnych zmian (np. w naszych Witrynach internetowych lub za pośrednictwem poczty elektronicznej).

P-39.1). W przypadku wszelkich praktyk związanych z przetwarzaniem informacji, które nie są w uzasadniony sposób powiązane z celami, dla których użytkownik skontaktował się z PlugShare, użytkownik ma prawo zrezygnować z takich praktyk związanych z przetwarzaniem informacji (w tym działań marketingowych, profilowania, reklamy behawioralnej, udostępniania stronom trzecim, które nie są usługodawcami).  

Mieszkańcy Kanady mają prawo do rezygnacji z wykorzystywania przez nas Danych osobowych do celów marketingu bezpośredniego oraz z innych rodzajów przetwarzania, które nie są w uzasadniony sposób niezbędne do udzielenia odpowiedzi na to, do czego nas zaangażowali.

W takich przypadkach zapewnimy, że odbiorcy przekazywanych Danych osobowych będą w stanie zapewnić przekazywanym Danym osobowym standard ochrony porównywalny ze standardami ochrony określonymi w przepisach o ochronie prywatności Singapuru poprzez wykorzystanie pisemnych umów o przekazywaniu danych (w przypadku przekazywania danych podmiotom zewnętrznym) lub wiążących reguł korporacyjnych (w przypadku przekazywania danych naszym podmiotom stowarzyszonym i innym podmiotom powiązanym z nami).

Monitorização comportamental. Também podemos utilizar estas tecnologias para recolher informações sobre as suas atividades online ao longo do tempo e em websites de terceiros ou outros serviços online, ou associar Informações Pessoais a outras informações recolhidas desta forma.

Análise da localização: as nossas Aplicações Móveis e Websites de navegadores móveis incluem funcionalidades (por exemplo, para o envio de uma revisão de um condutor de uma instalação de carregamento) que nos permite identificar a localização de um condutor e a localização da instalação de carregamento na qual um utilizador está atualmente localizado. Recolhemos informações como o endereço IP, ID do dispositivo e geolocalização. Os utilizadores de Aplicações Móveis podem optar por utilizar as Aplicações Móveis anonimamente ou iniciar sessão como utilizadores identificados, caso em que os dados pessoais fornecidos após o registo podem ser utilizados.

Para utilizadores das Aplicações Móveis, podemos pedir permissão para aceder a determinadas informações do seu dispositivo móvel, incluindo a sua lista de contactos, fotos e vídeos, microfone e câmara. É opcional que nos forneça acesso a estas informações. No entanto, determinadas funcionalidades das Aplicações Móveis podem não funcionar de forma ideal se decidir não nos fornecer permissão.

Web Beacons. As páginas dos nossos Websites e os nossos e-mails podem conter pequenos ficheiros eletrónicos conhecidos como web beacons (também referidos como clear gifs, pixel tags e single-pixel gifs) que nos permitem, por exemplo, contar os utilizadores que visitaram essas páginas ou abriram um e-mail e para outras estatísticas relacionadas com o website (por exemplo, registar a popularidade de determinado conteúdo do website e verificar a integridade do sistema e do servidor).

Pixéis de Rastreamento. Para além de utilizar cookies, os Websites podem empregar “pixéis de rastreamento”. Os pixéis de rastreamento envolvem a utilização de pixel tags que não são visíveis para o utilizador e consistem em algumas linhas de código informático. Os pixéis de rastreamento medem a eficácia dos anúncios e compilam estatísticas de utilização agregadas e específicas. Podemos aceder a estas pixel tags para identificar atividades e interesses que nos possam permitir corresponder melhor aos nossos Produtos, Serviços e ofertas com os seus interesses e necessidades. Por exemplo, se visitar os nossos Websites a partir de um anúncio em outro Website, o pixel tag permitirá ao anunciante rastrear se o seu anúncio conduziu o utilizador para os Websites. Se visitar os nossos Websites e o ligarmos a outro Website, também poderemos determinar que o utilizador foi direcionado para e/ou realizou uma transação com um website de terceiros.

GIF. Podemos utilizar imagens minúsculas conhecidas como clear GIFs para rastrear o comportamento dos utilizadores, incluindo estatísticas sobre quem abre os nossos e-mails.

Endereço IP. Os nossos servidores (ou os dos nossos prestadores de serviços) registam automaticamente determinadas informações de ficheiros de registo comunicadas a partir do seu navegador quando acede aos Websites. Estes registos de servidor podem incluir informações como as páginas dos Websites que visitou, o seu endereço de protocolo de Internet (“IP”), tipo de navegador e outras informações sobre como interage com os Websites. Estes ficheiros de registo são geralmente eliminados periodicamente.

Todos os pedidos de autoexclusão devem ser dirigidos para [\[email protected\]](https://company.plugshare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Na medida em que os pedidos de exclusão sejam honrados, terão efeito no tratamento futuro e não no tratamento que ocorreu com base no consentimento prévio.

2.1 TOMADA DE DECISÕES AUTOMATIZADAS
------------------------------------

Podemos utilizar as suas Informações Pessoais que nos fornece e que obtemos de outras fontes para compreender melhor os seus interesses, para que possamos tentar prever em que outros Produtos, Serviços e informações pode estar mais interessado. Esta prática envolve tomar decisões automatizadas sobre si com base nestas informações para nos permitir melhor adaptar as nossas interações consigo para torná-las mais relevantes e interessantes. Pode opor-se a que o façamos, a qualquer momento, ou pedir-nos mais informações sobre a metodologia aplicada nos nossos processos de tomada de decisões automatizadas, contactando-nos (consulte a Secção 12 abaixo).

2.2 MENSAGENS DE TEXTO
----------------------

Os nossos Serviços podem incluir o envio de mensagens do Serviço de Mensagens Curtas (Short Message Service“SMS”), que pode enviar até duas mensagens por dia para o seu dispositivo sem fios (a menos que comunique mais connosco), mas a frequência das mensagens pode variar.  Quando consente expressamente em receber mensagens de texto nossas e fornecer um número de telemóvel, está a consentir expressamente em receber mensagens de texto informativas e transacionais recorrentes de ou em nosso nome para o número que forneceu. Ao consentir expressamente em receber mensagens SMS da nossa parte e ao fornecer um número de telemóvel, garante e declara que é o proprietário do número de telemóvel que nos fornece. Podemos utilizar as suas informações para o contactar sobre a sua utilização, compras, devoluções (se disponíveis), atualizações do Website, realização de inquéritos ou comunicações informativas e relacionadas com os serviços, incluindo atualizações de segurança importantes. Depois de nos enviar a mensagem SMS “STOP”, enviar-lhe-emos uma mensagem SMS para confirmar que cancelou a sua subscrição. Em alternativa, pode enviar-nos o seu pedido por e-mail, incluindo o endereço de e-mail e o número de telefone que registou connosco, ou por qualquer outro meio razoável. Depois disso, deixará de receber mensagens SMS da nossa parte. Se quiser aderir novamente, basta registar-se como fez na primeira vez e começaremos a enviar-lhe mensagens SMS novamente. Para obter ajuda, responda a uma mensagem de texto com AJUDA. Podem aplicar-se taxas de mensagens e dados, dependendo do seu plano de telemóvel. As transportadoras não são responsáveis por mensagens atrasadas ou não entregues.

2.3 PLUG-INS DE REDES SOCIAIS
-----------------------------

Integramos interfaces ou plug-ins de programas de aplicativos de redes sociais (“Plug-ins”) de redes sociais, incluindo Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest e/ou possivelmente outras empresas, nos Websites. Para se registar como utilizador connosco, poderá ter a opção de iniciar sessão utilizando o seu início de sessão no Facebook ou em outra rede social.

Por exemplo, quando visita os nossos Websites, o plugin cria uma ligação direta entre o seu navegador e o servidor do Facebook. Isto permite ao Facebook receber informações sobre a sua visita aos nossos Websites com o seu endereço IP. Se clicar no botão “Gosto” do Facebook enquanto estiver ligado à sua conta do Facebook, pode associar o conteúdo dos nossos Websites ao seu perfil do Facebook. Isto permite ao Facebook atribuir a sua visita aos nossos Websites à sua conta de utilizador. Tenha em atenção que, como fornecedor dos Websites, não recebemos qualquer notificação sobre o conteúdo dos dados transmitidos ou a sua utilização pelo Facebook. Se não quiser que o Facebook atribua a sua visita aos nossos Websites à sua conta de utilizador do Facebook, termine a sessão na sua conta de utilizador do Facebook.

Se iniciar sessão através de um plug-in de rede social, autoriza-nos a aceder a determinadas informações de conta a partir desse site de redes sociais, como o seu perfil público nas redes sociais (consistente com as suas definições de privacidade no site das redes sociais), o seu endereço de e-mail, interesses, gostos, sexo, aniversário, histórico de educação, relações, interesses, cidade atual, fotos, descrição pessoal, lista de amigos, e informações e fotografias dos seus amigos nas redes sociais que possam ser amigos nas redes sociais com outros utilizadores. Os plug-ins podem transferir informações a seu respeito para a respetiva plataforma sem qualquer ação da sua parte. Estas informações podem incluir o seu número de identificação de utilizador da plataforma, em que website se encontra e muito mais. Interagir com um plug-in transmitirá informações diretamente para a rede social desse plug-in e essas informações poderão ser visíveis a outras pessoas nessa plataforma. Os plug-ins são controlados pela política de privacidade do respetivo site de redes sociais (disponível no seu site), e não pela nossa Política de Privacidade.

Não podemos fazer quaisquer declarações relativamente à utilização ou transferência de Informações Transferidas que possamos ter em caso de falência, reorganização, insolvência, liquidação ou uma cessão para benefício dos credores. Além disso, exceto conforme exigido por lei, não somos nem seremos responsáveis por qualquer violação de segurança por parte de quaisquer partes não afiliadas ou por quaisquer ações de quaisquer partes não afiliadas que recebam qualquer Informação Transferida que nos seja divulgada.

3.5 DIVULGAÇÕES NECESSÁRIAS; PROTEÇÃO DE DIREITOS; SEGURANÇA
------------------------------------------------------------

Salvo se descrito em contrário na presente Política de Privacidade, não divulgaremos as suas Informações Pessoais a qualquer parte não afiliada, a menos que tal seja exigido por lei, ordem judicial, processo legal (por exemplo, intimação), incluindo, mas não limitado a, para responder a qualquer pedido do governo, regulamentar, ou de licenciamento, ou se acreditarmos que tal ação é necessária para: (a) cumprir a lei, cumprir o processo legal que nos foi interposto ou às nossas afiliadas, subsidiárias, fornecedores contratados, ou parceiros de afinidade, ou investigar, prevenir, ou tomar medidas relativamente a atividades ilegais suspeitas ou reais; (b) aplicar os nossos Termos ou contrato de cliente (incluindo para fins de faturação e cobrança); (c) tomar precauções contra a responsabilidade; (d) investigar e defender-nos contra quaisquer reivindicações ou alegações de terceiros; (e) auxiliar agências governamentais de aplicação da lei ou para cumprir requisitos de segurança nacionais ou outros; (f) para proteger a segurança ou integridade dos nossos Websites, nosso, Serviços, e aplicações móveis; ou, (g) exercer ou proteger os direitos, propriedade, ou a nossa segurança pessoal, os nossos utilizadores ou outros. 

Tentaremos notificá-lo, quando praticável, sobre estes pedidos, a menos que: (i) o fornecimento de notificação seja proibido pelo próprio processo legal, por ordem judicial que recebemos, ou pela lei aplicável, ou (ii) acreditemos que o fornecimento de notificação seria fútil, ineficaz, crie um risco de lesão ou danos corporais ou outros danos a um indivíduo ou grupo, ou crie ou aumente um risco de fraude sobre nós, os nossos utilizadores, os nossos Websites, Serviços ou aplicações móveis. Nos casos em que cumprimos pedidos legais sem aviso prévio por estes motivos, tentaremos notificar esse utilizador sobre o pedido após o facto de determinarmos de boa-fé que já não estamos legalmente proibidos de o fazer e que não se aplicam quaisquer cenários de risco descritos neste parágrafo.

3.6 DIVULGAÇÃO DE INFORMAÇÕES PESSOAIS NÃO IDENTIFICADAS
--------------------------------------------------------

Podemos partilhar Informações Pessoais Não Identificadas (incluindo, mas não limitado a, dados de utilização anónimos, páginas de referência/saída e URL, endereço IP, tipos de plataforma, número de cliques, etc.) com partes não afiliadas de qualquer forma que escolhamos e para qualquer finalidade, como para administração do sistema e para monitorizar a utilização dos Websites; para medir o número de visitas aos nossos Websites, tempo médio gasto, número de páginas visualizadas; e monitorizar várias outras estatísticas do Website para melhorar o conteúdo.

4\.  PEDIDOS “DO NOT TRACK” (NÃO RASTREAR)
==========================================

Alguns navegadores Web (incluindo Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox e Chrome) incorporam uma funcionalidade “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) ou semelhante que sinaliza aos websites que um utilizador não quer que a sua atividade e comportamento online sejam monitorizados. Se um website que responde a um sinal DNT específico receber o sinal DNT, o navegador pode bloquear esse website para o mesmo que não recolha determinadas informações sobre o utilizador do navegador. Nem todos os navegadores oferecem uma opção DNT e os sinais DNT ainda não são uniformes. Por este motivo, muitos operadores de websites, incluindo a PlugShare, não respondem a sinais DNT.

5\. COMUNICAÇÕES, PREFERÊNCIAS E AUTOEXCLUSÃO DA PLUGSHARE
==========================================================

Ao facultar-nos o seu endereço de e-mail, autoriza a nossa utilização do endereço de e-mail para lhe enviar notificações relacionadas com o Serviço por e-mail, incluindo, mas não se limitando a, quaisquer notificações exigidas por lei (por exemplo, notificação de incidentes de privacidade ou segurança de dados), em vez da comunicação por correio postal. Concorda também que podemos enviar-lhe notificações de atividade relativamente aos nossos Produtos, Serviços, Websites, aplicações móveis, as suas Informações Pessoais ou qualquer aspeto da nossa relação, para o endereço de e-mail que nos fornece, de acordo com quaisquer definições de privacidade aplicáveis. Poderemos utilizar o seu endereço de e-mail para lhe enviar outras mensagens ou conteúdo, tais como, mas não se limitando a, newsletters, adições ou alterações a funcionalidades do Serviço, ou ofertas especiais. Se não quiser receber essas mensagens de e-mail, pode optar por não receber clicando em Cancelar subscrição, quando disponível. A exclusão pode impedir que receba mensagens de e-mail relativas a atualizações, melhorias, funcionalidades especiais, anúncios ou ofertas. Não pode optar por não receber e-mails relacionados com o Serviço. Se optou por não nos fornecer um e-mail ou outro endereço, poderá não receber os nossos e-mails relacionados com o Serviço.

Através da página de definições da sua conta de utilizador, pode aceder e, em alguns casos, editar ou eliminar determinadas informações que nos forneceu, tais como nome e palavra-passe, endereço de e-mail, endereço, informações de perfil de utilizador, etc. As informações que pode ver, atualizar e eliminar podem mudar à medida que os Produtos, Websites, Serviços ou as nossas práticas mudam. Se tiver alguma dúvida sobre a visualização ou atualização das informações que temos em arquivo sobre si, entre em contacto connosco. No entanto, quando atualiza informações, poderemos manter uma cópia das informações não revistas nos nossos registos. Pode solicitar a eliminação da sua conta enviando-nos um e-mail. É da sua responsabilidade manter o seu endereço de e-mail atual connosco. Dependendo do estado ou país em que reside, poderá ter direitos adicionais. Consulte abaixo para obter mais informações.

6\. PROGRAMADORES QUE UTILIZAM SERVIÇOS DE PLATAFORMA DA PLUGSHARE
==================================================================

Colaboramos e permitimos que terceiros utilizem a plataforma de programadores da PlugShare para oferecer serviços e funcionalidades em conjunto com a PlugShare. Estes programadores terceiros negociaram um acordo para utilizar a tecnologia da plataforma da PlugShare ou concordaram com as nossas Interfaces de Programação de Aplicações (Application Programming Interfaces) (“API”) e termos de Plug-In para criar aplicações de plataforma de software (“Aplicações de Plataforma”). Tanto os acordos negociados como a nossa API e termos de utilização de Plug-In contêm restrições sobre como terceiros podem aceder, armazenar e utilizar as Informações Pessoais que fornece à PlugShare. Se optar por utilizar uma Aplicação de Plataforma, ser-lhe-á pedido que confirme a aceitação da política de privacidade e do acordo de utilizador do programador de terceiros. Para revogar a permissão concedida a uma Aplicação de Plataforma, visite as suas definições. No entanto, tenha em atenção que, mesmo que revogue a permissão concedida a uma Aplicação da Plataforma, as suas ligações podem continuar a utilizar a Aplicação da Plataforma, pelo que a Aplicação da Plataforma pode ainda ter acesso a determinadas informações sobre si, tal como as suas ligações.

7\. RETENÇÃO DE INFORMAÇÕES PESSOAIS
====================================

O período de tempo durante o qual conservamos as suas Informações Pessoais depende das finalidades para as quais as utilizamos. Conservaremos as suas Informações Pessoais enquanto a sua conta estiver ativa, ou enquanto for um titular de conta registado ou utilizador dos nossos Serviços ou enquanto tivermos outro objetivo comercial para o fazer (como, por exemplo, mas não limitado a, negócios, assuntos fiscais, ou para fins legais) e, depois disso, por um período não superior ao exigido ou permitido por lei, ou a nossa política de retenção de registos, razoavelmente necessário para fins internos de relatório e reconciliação, ou para lhe fornecer feedback ou informações que possa solicitar. Este período de retenção está sujeito à nossa revisão e alteração. Podemos reter Informações Pessoais Não Identificadas durante o tempo que considerarmos apropriado.

Após a cessação ou desativação da sua conta de utilizador, podemos reter as suas informações de perfil e todas as informações publicadas em áreas públicas dos Websites.

8\. RECOLHA NÃO INTENCIONAL DE DADOS DE CRIANÇAS
================================================

Não recolhemos, solicitamos ou mantemos intencionalmente Informações Pessoais de qualquer utilizador com idade inferior a 18 anos ou permitimos conscientemente que tais utilizadores se registem ou utilizem os nossos Serviços. Se tiver menos de 18 anos, não nos envie quaisquer Informações Pessoais. Caso tenhamos conhecimento de que recolhemos Informações Pessoais de uma criança com idade inferior a 18 anos sem verificação do consentimento parental, envidaremos esforços comercialmente razoáveis para eliminar essas informações da nossa base de dados.

9\. QUANDO AS INFORMAÇÕES PESSOAIS SÃO TRATADAS E ARMAZENADAS; LEGISLAÇÃO APLICÁVEL
===================================================================================

Temos a nossa sede nos Estados Unidos. As Informações Pessoais que nós ou os nossos Prestadores de Serviços recolhemos podem ser armazenadas e tratadas em servidores dentro ou fora dos Estados Unidos e onde quer que nós e os nossos Prestadores de Serviços tenhamos instalações em todo o mundo, e determinadas informações podem ser acessíveis por pessoas ou empresas fora dos Estados Unidos que nos prestam serviços. O utilizador autoriza a transmissão e/ou transferência das suas Informações Pessoais, por nós e pelos nossos Prestadores de Serviços para, ou o acesso às mesmas, jurisdições que podem não proporcionar níveis equivalentes de proteção de dados à sua jurisdição nacional. Tomaremos medidas razoáveis para garantir que as suas Informações Pessoais recebem um nível adequado de proteção nas jurisdições em que as tratamos.

As leis dos EUA aplicam-se na medida em que seja residente nos Estados Unidos. Caso contrário, a presente Política de Privacidade e todas as outras questões serão interpretadas e interpretadas de acordo com as leis da província/estado e federais da jurisdição em que reside. As jurisdições fora da sua residência podem ter leis de privacidade diferentes das que constam da sua, incluindo o direito de aplicação da lei e autoridades governamentais a aceder às Informações Pessoais.  Na medida em que tratamos dados fora do seu país, realizamos uma avaliação de impacto na privacidade para determinar que os nossos Prestadores de Serviços podem oferecer substancialmente o mesmo nível de proteção exigido na sua jurisdição e celebramos contratos para reforçar ainda mais as obrigações para tratar adequadamente as suas Informações Pessoais.

10\. SEGURANÇA
==============

1. COMO RESPONDEMOS PARA NÃO RASTREAR SINAIS.

Alguns navegadores Web transmitem sinais de “não rastrear” (DNT/GPC) para os sites e outros serviços online com os quais o seu navegador Web comunica. Atualmente, não há nenhuma norma que governe aquilo que os sites devem fazer, se for caso disso, quando recebem estes sinais; no entanto, dispomos atualmente de medidas para agir em resposta a estes sinais.

Também podemos utilizar estas tecnologias para recolher informações sobre as suas atividades online ao longo do tempo e em websites de terceiros ou outros serviços online, ou para associar Informações Pessoais a outras informações recolhidas desta forma. Podemos utilizar Informações Pessoais para seguir os padrões de clique e navegação dos utilizadores.

Para exercer os direitos de acesso, correção, portabilidade de dados e eliminação descritos acima, envie-nos um pedido usando o nosso formulário disponível [aqui](https://company.plugshare.com/privacy-notice.html#data-form). Apenas você ou uma pessoa que tenha autorizado a agir em seu nome pode fazer um pedido relacionado com as suas informações pessoais. Também pode fazer um pedido em nome do seu filho menor. Se recebermos um pedido de uma pessoa para exercer o direito em seu nome, solicitaremos uma cópia da sua permissão assinada na qual autoriza o envio de tais pedidos em seu nome e entraremos em contacto consigo para confirmar diretamente essa autorização. Só pode efetuar um pedido de acesso ou portabilidade de dados duas vezes num período de 12 meses. O pedido verificável do Consumidor tem de:

* Fornecer informações suficientes que nos permitam verificar razoavelmente se é a pessoa sobre quem recolhemos Informações Pessoais ou que um representante autorizado fez o pedido.
* Descreva o seu pedido com detalhes suficientes que nos permitam compreender, avaliar e responder adequadamente ao mesmo.

Não podemos responder ao seu pedido ou fornecer-lhe Informações Pessoais se não pudermos verificar a sua identidade ou autoridade para fazer o pedido e confirmar que as Informações Pessoais estão relacionadas consigo. A apresentação de um pedido não obriga a criar uma conta connosco. Apenas utilizaremos as Informações Pessoais fornecidas num pedido para verificar a identidade ou autoridade do requerente para fazer o pedido.

Para exercer os direitos de exclusão da publicidade comportamental em contexto cruzado, da publicidade direcionada ou da partilha de Informações Pessoais conforme descrito acima, a exclusão terá de ser efetuada com base na plataforma em que está.  Queira assinalar que o seu pedido de exclusão é específico para o dispositivo e plataforma em que o pedido é apresentado, pelo que poderá ter de enviar vários pedidos caso pretenda autoexcluir-se destas atividades de tratamento específicas no que se refere a vários dispositivos e plataformas.

### Processo de verificação

Após receber um pedido de acesso, correção, portabilidade de dados ou eliminação de dados, enviar-lhe-emos um e-mail no prazo de 10 dias úteis para o endereço de e-mail que temos em seu nome. O e-mail irá pedir-lhe que responda para verificar a sua qualidade como Consumidor que faz o pedido. Após a receção da sua verificação, iremos fazer corresponder as suas informações com as que temos no nosso ficheiro. Após a verificação da sua identidade, prosseguiremos para processar o seu pedido e responder no prazo de 45 dias de calendário, a menos que (a) não possamos verificar o seu pedido, (b) se não conseguirmos fazer corresponder-lhe informações na nossa base de dados, ou (c) se existir uma exceção ao abrigo da lei que nos isente do cumprimento do seu pedido. Se precisarmos de mais tempo (até um período adicional de quarenta e cinco (45) dias de calendário), informá-lo-emos do motivo e do período de extensão por escrito.

Se não pudermos atender ao seu pedido, a resposta que fornecermos explicará os motivos para tal. Para pedidos de portabilidade de dados, selecionaremos um formato para fornecer as suas Informações Pessoais que seja prontamente utilizável e que lhe permita transmitir as informações de uma entidade para outra entidade sem obstáculos.

Não cobramos uma taxa para processar ou responder ao seu pedido verificável do Consumidor, a menos que seja excessivo, repetitivo ou manifestamente infundado. Se determinarmos que o pedido justifica uma taxa, informá-lo-emos do motivo pelo qual tomámos essa decisão e fornecer-lhe-emos uma estimativa de custos antes de concluir o seu pedido.

Esta Política de Privacidade não se aplica a websites, aplicações ou serviços que não apresentem ou tenham uma ligação para esta Política de Privacidade ou que apresentem ou tenham uma ligação para uma política de privacidade diferente. Apenas para residentes e cidadãos da Região da UE, na medida em que qualquer definição na presente Política de Privacidade entre em conflito com uma definição ao abrigo do RGPD, a definição do RGPD prevalecerá.

Relativamente ao método (e), podemos transferir Informações Pessoais para um terceiro para executar um contrato consigo, com o seu consentimento explícito ou de uma forma que não supere os seus direitos e liberdades. Se estas Informações Pessoais não forem tratadas e transferidas, não poderemos executar o contrato consigo ou não terá acesso a nenhum ou todos os benefícios e funcionalidades associados à sua transação.

Também podemos precisar de transferir as suas informações para outras empresas do grupo ou prestadores de serviços em países fora da Região da UE. Isto pode acontecer se os nossos servidores ou fornecedores e prestadores de serviços estiverem sediados fora da Região da UE, ou se utilizar os nossos Produtos e/ou Serviços ao visitar países fora destas áreas.

-----------------------------------------------------

Pe măsură ce navigați pe și interacționați cu Serviciile noastre, putem utiliza, de asemenea, tehnologii automate de colectare a datelor pentru a colecta anumite informații de pe dispozitivul, browserul dvs. sau alte activități din rețea, conform descrierii din Politica noastră privind modulele cookie, disponibilă la [https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html](https://company.plugshare.com/cookies.html).

Informațiile despre vizita pe Site și despre dispozitiv. Colectăm detalii despre vizitele dvs. pe Site-urile noastre și despre utilizarea Aplicațiilor noastre mobile, inclusiv, dar fără a se limita la, date privind traficul, date privind geolocația, jurnale și alte date de comunicare și resursele pe care le accesați și utilizați pe Site-uri. Colectăm informații despre computerul, dispozitivul mobil și conexiunea dvs. la internet, inclusiv adresa IP, sistemul de operare, tipul de browser, tiparele dvs. privind fluxul de clicuri (adică, pe ce faceți clic pe un site), adresa URL a celui mai recent site pe care l-ați vizitat înainte de a accesa Site-urile noastre, timpul petrecut pe Site-urile noastre și paginile pe care le-ați vizualizat în timp ce navigați pe Site-urile noastre. Este posibil să obținem o estimare aproximativă a locației dvs. pe baza adresei dvs. IP atunci când vizitați Site-urile noastre. Pentru utilizatorii Aplicațiilor noastre mobile, putem colecta și păstra un istoric al informațiilor dvs. exacte despre locație folosind tehnologiile Wi-Fi și/sau Bluetooth, precum și identificatorii dispozitivului dvs. și coordonatele GPS (de ex., latitudine/longitudine). Dacă doriți să împiedicați colectarea informațiilor despre locația dvs., vă rugăm să ajustați setările dispozitivului dvs. mobil pentru a limita accesul Aplicației mobile la informațiile despre locația dvs.

Când utilizați site-ul nostru web, împărtășim informațiile pe care le colectăm de la dvs., cum ar fi e-mailul dvs. (în formă hashing), adresa IP sau informații despre browser sau sistemul dvs. de operare, cu partenerii noștri de identitate/furnizorii de servicii. Acești parteneri returnează un cod de identificare online pe care îl putem stoca în cookie-ul nostru primar pentru a-l folosi în publicitate online, în aplicație și pe mai multe canale și poate fi împărtășit cu companiile de publicitate pentru a permite publicitate orientată și bazată pe interese. Pentru a renunța la această utilizare, faceți clic aici ([https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/)).

Urmărirea comportamentului. De asemenea, putem utiliza aceste tehnologii pentru a colecta informații despre activitățile dvs. online în timp și pe site-uri terțe sau alte servicii online sau pentru a asocia Informațiile cu caracter personal cu alte informații colectate în acest mod.

Location Analytics: Aplicațiile noastre mobile și Site-urile noastre cu browser mobil includ funcții (de ex., pentru trimiterea unei analize privind șoferul în legătură cu o unitate de încărcare) care ne permit să identificăm locația unui șofer și locația unității de încărcare la care se află în prezent un utilizator. Colectăm informații precum adresa IP, ID-ul dispozitivului și locația geografică. Utilizatorii Aplicațiilor mobile pot alege să utilizeze Aplicațiile mobile în mod anonim sau să se conecteze ca utilizator identificat, caz în care pot fi utilizate datele cu caracter personal furnizate la înregistrare.

Pentru utilizatorii Aplicațiilor mobile, putem solicita permisiunea de a accesa anumite informații de pe dispozitivul dvs. mobil, inclusiv lista dvs. de contacte, fotografii și videoclipuri, microfon și cameră. Este opțional să ne furnizați accesul la aceste informații. Cu toate acestea, este posibil ca anumite caracteristici ale Aplicațiilor mobile să nu funcționeze optim dacă decideți să nu ne acordați permisiunea.

Semnalizatoare web. Paginile Site-urilor noastre și e-mailurile noastre pot conține mici fișiere electronice cunoscute sub numele de semnalizatoare web (denumite și gif-uri clare, etichete pixel și gif-uri cu un singur pixel) care ne permit, de exemplu, să numărăm utilizatorii care au vizitat paginile respective sau au deschis un e-mail și pentru alte statistici legate de site (de exemplu, înregistrarea popularității anumitor conținuturi ale site-ului și verificarea integrității sistemului și serverului).

Pixelii de urmărire. Pe lângă utilizarea modulelor cookie, Site-urile pot utiliza „pixeli de urmărire”. Pixelii de urmărire implică utilizarea de etichete pixel care nu sunt vizibile pentru utilizator și constau din câteva linii de cod de computer. Prin pixelii de urmărire se măsoară eficiența reclamelor și se compilează statistici agregate și specifice de utilizare. Putem accesa aceste etichete pixel pentru a identifica activitatea și interesele care ne pot permit să potrivim mai bine Produsele, Serviciile și ofertele noastre cu interesele și nevoile dvs. De exemplu, dacă vizitați Site-urile noastre dintr-o reclamă de pe un alt site, eticheta pixel va permite agenției de publicitate să urmărească faptul că publicitatea sa v-a adus pe Site-uri. Dacă vizitați Site-urile noastre și vă conectăm la un alt site, este posibil, de asemenea, să putem stabili că ați fost trimis către și/sau ați tranzacționat cu un site terț.

Adresa IP. Serverele noastre (sau cele ale furnizorilor noștri de servicii) înregistrează automat anumite informații din fișierele jurnal raportate din browserul dvs. atunci când accesați Site-urile. Aceste jurnale de server pot include informații precum paginile de pe Site-urile pe care le-ați vizitat, adresa protocolului dvs. de internet („IP”), tipul de browser și alte informații despre modul în care interacționați cu Site-urile. În general, aceste fișiere jurnal sunt șterse periodic.

Valori și analize terțe. Valorile și analizele terțe, pe anumite pagini sau caracteristici ale Serviciilor, pentru a ne ajuta să înțelegem și să analizăm traficul de vizitatori, măsoară eficacitatea promoțională și eficiența caracteristicilor, ofertelor și campaniilor noastre de marketing. De asemenea, utilizăm aceste instrumente pentru a identifica capcanele, deficiențele și domeniile operațiunilor noastre care au nevoie de îmbunătățire și pentru a vizualiza performanța generală și poziția noastră în ceea ce privește prezența online. Aceste instrumente pot stoca module cookie pe dispozitivul dvs. la discreția lor.

Putem utiliza informațiile dvs. pentru a vă contacta cu privire la utilizarea, achizițiile, retururile dvs. (dacă sunt disponibile), actualizările Site-urilor, desfășurarea sondajelor sau comunicările informaționale și legate de servicii, inclusiv actualizările importante de securitate. După ce ne trimiteți mesajul SMS „STOP”, vă vom trimite un mesaj SMS pentru a confirma că v-ați dezabonat. Alternativ, ne puteți trimite solicitarea dvs. prin e-mail, inclusiv adresa de e-mail și numărul de telefon pe care le-ați înregistrat la noi sau prin orice mijloace rezonabile. După aceasta, nu veți mai primi mesaje SMS de la noi. Dacă doriți să vă înscrieți din nou, înregistrați-vă așa cum ați făcut prima dată și vom începe să vă trimitem din nou mesaje SMS. Pentru ajutor, vă rugăm să răspundeți la un text cu AJUTOR. Se pot aplica tarife pentru mesaje și date, în funcție de abonamentul dvs. pentru telefonul mobil. Transportatorii nu sunt responsabili pentru mesajele întârziate sau nelivrate.

2.3 PLUGIN-URI PENTRU REȚELELE DE SOCIALIZARE
---------------------------------------------

Integrăm interfețe sau plug-in-uri pentru programe de aplicații pe rețelele de socializare („Plug-in\-uri”) de pe rețelele de socializare, inclusiv Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Xing, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest și/sau posibil alte companii, pe Site-urile noastre. Pentru a vă înregistra ca utilizator la noi, este posibil să aveți opțiunea de a vă autentifica folosind contul dvs. de Facebook sau alte site-uri de socializare.

De exemplu, atunci când vizitați Site-urile noastre, plugin-ul creează o conexiune directă între browserul dvs. și serverul Facebook. Acest lucru permite ca Facebook să primească informații despre vizita dvs. pe Site-urile noastre cu adresa dvs. IP. Dacă faceți clic pe butonul „Like” de pe Facebook în timp ce sunteți conectat la contul dvs. de Facebook, puteți conecta conținutul Site-urilor noastre la profilul dvs. de Facebook. Acest lucru permite ca Facebook să aloce vizita dvs. pe Site-urile noastre contului dvs. de utilizator. Vă rugăm să rețineți că, în calitate de furnizor al Site-urilor, nu primim nicio notificare cu privire la conținutul datelor transmise sau la utilizarea acestora de către Facebook. Dacă nu doriți ca Facebook să aloce vizita dvs. pe Site-urile noastre contului dvs. de utilizator Facebook, vă rugăm să vă deconectați din contul dvs. de utilizator Facebook.

Dacă vă conectați printr-un plug-in de pe rețelele de socializare, ne autorizați să accesăm anumite informații despre cont de pe site-ul de socializare respectiv, cum ar fi profilul dvs. public de pe rețelele de socializare (în conformitate cu setările dvs. de confidențialitate de pe site-ul de socializare), adresa dvs. de e-mail, interesele, aprecierile, sexul, ziua de naștere, istoricul educației, relațiile, interesele, orașul actual, fotografiile, descrierea personală, lista de prieteni și informații despre și fotografii ale prietenilor de pe site-ul dvs. de socializare care ar putea fi prieteni de pe site-ul de socializare cu alți utilizatori. Plug-in-urile pot transfera informații despre dvs. pe platforma Plug-in-ului respectiv fără a fi acționate de dvs. Aceste informații pot include numărul dvs. de identificare ca utilizator al platformei, site-ul pe care vă aflați și multe altele. Interacțiunea cu un Plug-in va transmite informații direct către rețeaua de socializare a acelui Plug-in, iar informațiile respective pot fi vizibile de alte persoane de pe platforma respectivă. Plug-inurile sunt controlate de politica de confidențialitate a site-ului respectiv de socializare (disponibilă pe site-ul respectiv) și nu de Politica noastră de confidențialitate.

* Date de geolocalizare

Aveți posibilitatea de a vă dezabona de la această partajare făcând clic pe solicitările de dezabonare care vor apărea în notificarea care vă este comunicată la prima vizită a aplicațiilor noastre mobile sau a Site-urilor noastre.

-------------------------------

Confirmați (și nu vă veți opune) divulgării sau transferului de către noi a Informațiilor dvs. cu caracter personal, a Informațiilor cu caracter personal dezidentificate și a altor informații pe care ni le furnizați, precum și a drepturilor pe care le-ați acordat sau confirmat în această Politică de confidențialitate (denumite în continuare împreună „Informațiile transferate”) către un cumpărător sau achizitor potențial sau real al companiei noastre sau alt succesor în scopul analizării sau realizării unei fuziuni, cesiuni, restructurări, reorganizări, dizolvări, modificări a controlului sau transfer al unora din sau al tuturor activelor noastre (fiecare dintre cele de mai sus fiind denumită „Transferul”), fie ca o continuare a activității, fie ca parte a unei proceduri de faliment, lichidare sau a altei proceduri judiciare, în care Informațiile cu caracter personal deținute de noi se numără printre activele transferate, și sunteți de acord să nu vă opuneți unei astfel de divulgări și/sau transfer. Nu putem face nicio declarație cu privire la utilizarea sau transferul Informațiilor transferate pe care le putem deține în caz de faliment, reorganizare, insolvență, administrare judiciară sau cesiune în beneficiul creditorilor. În plus, cu excepția cazurilor impuse de lege, nu suntem și nu vom fi responsabili pentru nicio încălcare a securității de către nicio parte neafiliată sau pentru nicio acțiune a oricărei părți neafiliate care primește oricare dintre Informațiile transferate care ne sunt divulgate.

3.5 DIVULGĂRILE NECESARE; PROTEJAREA DREPTURILOR; SIGURANȚA
-----------------------------------------------------------

Cu excepția cazului în care se descrie altfel în această Politică de confidențialitate, nu vom divulga Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal niciunei părți neafiliate, cu excepția cazului în care acest lucru este impus prin lege, ordin judecătoresc, proces juridic (de ex., citație), inclusiv, dar fără a se limita la, pentru a răspunde oricărui guvern, autoritate de reglementare sau cerere de licențiere, sau în cazul în care considerăm că o astfel de acțiune este necesară pentru: (a) a respecta legea, a respecta procesul juridic aplicat nouă sau afiliaților, filialelor, furnizorilor contractați sau parteneri lor noștri de afinitate, sau a investiga, preveni sau a lua măsuri cu privire la activități ilegale suspectate sau efective; (b) a pune în aplicare Termenii noștri sau contractul cu clienții (inclusiv în scopuri de facturare și colectare); (c) a lua măsuri de precauție împotriva răspunderii; (d) a investiga și a ne apăra împotriva oricăror pretenții sau acuzații ale terților; (e) a asista agențiile guvernamentale de aplicare a legii sau a îndeplini cerințele naționale sau alte cerințe de securitate guvernamentale; (f) a proteja securitatea sau integritatea Site-urilor noastre, integritatea noastră, integritatea Serviciilor și aplicațiilor noastre mobile sau, (g) a exercita sau a proteja drepturile, proprietatea sau siguranța personală a noastră, a utilizatorilor noștri sau a altor persoane. 

Vom încerca să vă notificăm, acolo unde este posibil, cu privire la aceste solicitări, cu excepția cazului în care: (i) furnizarea notificării este interzisă prin procesul legal în sine, prin ordinul judecătoresc pe care îl primim sau prin legislația aplicabilă sau (ii) considerăm că furnizarea notificării ar fi inutilă, ineficientă, ar crea un risc de vătămare corporală sau alte vătămări corporale ale unei persoane sau ale unui grup sau ar crea sau crește riscul de fraudă asupra noastră, a utilizatorilor noștri, a Site-urilor, Serviciilor sau aplicațiilor noastre mobile. În cazurile în care ne conformăm solicitărilor legale fără notificare din aceste motive, vom încerca să notificăm utilizatorul respectiv cu privire la solicitare după ce stabilim cu bună-credință că nu ne mai este interzis prin lege să facem acest lucru și că nu se aplică niciun scenariu de risc descris la acest alineat.

3.6 DIVULGAREA INFORMAȚIILOR CU CARACTER PERSONAL DEZIDENTIFICATE
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Putem partaja Informații cu caracter personal dezidentificate (inclusiv, dar fără a se limita la, date de utilizare anonime, pagini și URL-uri de referință/ieșire, adresa IP, tipuri de platforme, numărul de clicuri etc.) cu părți neafiliate în orice mod și în orice scop, cum ar fi pentru administrarea sistemului și pentru monitorizarea utilizării Site-urilor; pentru măsurarea numărului de vizite pe Site-urile noastre, a timpului mediu petrecut, a numărului de pagini vizualizate și pentru monitorizarea diverselor alte statistici ale Site-urilor pentru a îmbunătăți conținutul.

4\.  SOLICITĂRILE DE „DO NOT TRACK”
===================================

Unele browsere web (inclusiv Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox și Chrome) includ o caracteristică „Do Not Track” („DNT”) sau o caracteristică similară care semnalează site-urilor că un utilizator nu dorește să îi fie urmărite activitatea și comportamentul online. Dacă un site care răspunde la un anumit semnal DNT recepționează semnalul DNT, browserul poate bloca acel site de la colectarea anumitor informații despre utilizatorul browserului. Nu toate browserele oferă o opțiune DNT, iar semnalele DNT nu sunt încă uniforme. Din acest motiv, mulți operatori de site-uri, inclusiv PlugShare, nu răspund la semnalele DNT.

5\. COMUNICĂRI, PREFERINȚE ȘI RENUNȚARE PLUGSHARE
=================================================

Prin furnizarea adresei dvs. de e-mail, sunteți de acord ca noi să utilizăm adresa de e-mail pentru a vă trimite notificări legate de servicii prin e-mail, inclusiv, dar fără a se limita la, orice notificări impuse de lege (de exemplu, notificări privind confidențialitatea datelor sau incidente de securitate), în locul comunicării prin poștă. De asemenea, sunteți de acord că vă putem trimite notificări privind activitatea cu privire la Produsele, Serviciile, Site-urile, aplicațiile noastre mobile, Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal sau orice aspect al relației noastre, la adresa de e-mail pe care ne-o furnizați, în conformitate cu orice setări de confidențialitate aplicabile. Putem utiliza adresa dvs. de e-mail pentru a vă trimite alte mesaje sau conținut, cum ar fi, dar fără a se limita la, buletine informative, completări sau modificări ale caracteristicilor Serviciului sau oferte speciale. Dacă nu doriți să primiți astfel de mesaje de e-mail, puteți renunța făcând clic pe Dezabonare, dacă este disponibil. Renunțarea vă poate împiedica să primiți mesaje e-mail cu privire la actualizări, îmbunătățiri, caracteristici speciale, anunțuri sau oferte. Nu aveți dreptul să renunțați la e-mailurile legate de Serviciu. Dacă ați ales să nu ne furnizați un e-mail sau o altă adresă, este posibil să nu primiți e-mailurile noastre legate de Serviciu.

Prin intermediul paginii de setări a contului dvs. de utilizator, puteți accesa și, în unele cazuri, puteți edita sau șterge anumite informații pe care ni le-ați furnizat, cum ar fi numele și parola, adresa de e-mail, adresa, informațiile profilului de utilizator etc. Informațiile pe care le puteți vizualiza, actualiza și șterge se pot modifica pe măsură ce Produsele, Site-urile, Serviciile sau practicile noastre se modifică. Dacă aveți întrebări despre vizualizarea sau actualizarea informațiilor pe care le avem la dosar despre dvs., vă rugăm să ne contactați. Cu toate acestea, atunci când actualizați informațiile, putem păstra o copie a informațiilor nerevizuite în evidențele noastre. Puteți solicita ștergerea contului dvs. trimițându-ne un e-mail. Este responsabilitatea dvs. să păstrați adresa de e-mail actuală la noi. În funcție de statul sau țara în care locuiți, puteți avea drepturi suplimentare. Vă rugăm să consultați mai jos mai multe informații.

6\. DEZVOLTATORII CARE UTILIZEAZĂ SERVICIILE PLATFORMEI PLUGSHARE
=================================================================

Colaborăm cu terții și le permitem acestora să utilizeze platforma de dezvoltare PlugShare pentru a oferi servicii și funcționalități împreună cu PlugShare. Acești dezvoltatori terți fie au negociat un acord de utilizare a platformei PlugShare, fie au fost de acord cu interfețele noastre de programare aplicații cu autoservire („API”) și termenii plug-in-ului pentru a construi aplicații pentru platforma software („Aplicații platformă”). Atât contractele negociate, cât și API-ul nostru și termenii de utilizare a plug-in-ului conțin restricții privind modul în care terții pot accesa, stoca și utiliza Informațiile cu caracter personal pe care le furnizați către PlugShare. Dacă alegeți să utilizați o Aplicație pentru platformă, vi se va solicita să confirmați acceptarea politicii de confidențialitate și acordul utilizatorului al dezvoltatorului terț. Pentru a revoca permisiunea acordată unei Aplicații pentru platformă, vă rugăm să vizitați setările dvs. Rețineți, totuși, că, chiar dacă revocați permisiunea acordată unei Aplicații pentru platformă, este posibil ca conexiunile dvs. să utilizeze în continuare Aplicația pentru platformă, astfel încât Aplicația pentru platformă să poată avea în continuare acces la anumite informații despre dvs., la fel ca și conexiunile dvs.

7\. PĂSTRAREA INFORMAȚIILOR CU CARACTER PERSONAL
================================================

Perioada de timp pentru care păstrăm Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal depinde de scopurile pentru care le utilizăm. Vom păstra Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal atât timp cât contul dvs. este activ, sau atâta timp cât sunteți titular de cont înregistrat sau utilizator al Serviciilor noastre sau atât timp cât avem un alt scop de afaceri în acest sens (cum ar fi, dar fără a se limita la, pentru afaceri, impozit, sau în scopuri legale) și ulterior, nu mai mult decât este impus sau permis de lege, sau politica noastră de păstrare a înregistrărilor, necesare în mod rezonabil în scopuri de raportare și reconciliere internă, sau pentru a vă oferi feedback sau informații pe care le-ați putea solicita. Această perioadă de păstrare este supusă evaluării și modificării de către noi. Putem păstra Informațiile cu caracter personal dezidentificate atât timp cât considerăm că este adecvat.

În urma închiderii sau dezactivării contului dvs. de utilizator, putem păstra informațiile dvs. de profil și toate informațiile postate în zonele publice ale Site-urilor. În urma închiderii sau dezactivării contului dvs. de utilizator, putem păstra Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal și alte date, dar le vom păstra în condiții de confidențialitate, în conformitate cu Termenii, această Politică de confidențialitate și după cum impune legislația aplicabilă. Avem dreptul de a șterge toate Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal și alte date după închiderea contului dvs. de utilizator, fără a vă notifica.

8\. NICIO COLECTARE INTENȚIONATĂ A DATELOR COPIILOR
===================================================

Nu colectăm, nu solicităm sau nu păstrăm cu bună știință Informații cu caracter personal de la nicio persoană cu vârsta sub 18 ani și nu permitem acestor persoane să se înregistreze sau să utilizeze Serviciile noastre. Dacă aveți vârsta sub 18 ani, vă rugăm să nu ne trimiteți nicio Informație cu caracter personal. În cazul în care luăm cunoștință despre faptul că am colectat Informații cu caracter personal de la un copil cu vârsta sub 18 ani fără verificarea consimțământului parental, vom depune eforturi rezonabile din punct de vedere comercial pentru a șterge aceste informații din baza noastră de date.

9\. UNDE SUNT PRELUCRATE ȘI STOCATE INFORMAȚIILE CU CARACTER PERSONAL; LEGISLAȚIA APLICABILĂ
============================================================================================

Avem sediul central în Statele Unite. Informațiile cu caracter personal pe care noi sau Furnizorii noștri de servicii le colectăm pot fi stocate și prelucrate pe servere din interiorul sau din afara Statelor Unite și oriunde noi și Furnizorii noștri de servicii avem sedii în întreaga lume, iar anumite informații pot fi accesibile persoanelor sau companiilor din afara Statelor Unite care ne furnizează servicii. Sunteți de acord ca Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal să fie transmise și/sau transferate de noi și de Furnizorii noștri de servicii către, sau să fie accesate în, jurisdicții care ar putea să nu ofere niveluri de protecție a datelor echivalente cu cele din jurisdicția dvs. de origine. Vom lua măsuri rezonabile pentru a ne asigura că Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal beneficiază de un nivel adecvat de protecție în jurisdicțiile în care le prelucrăm.

Legile SUA se aplică în măsura în care sunteți un rezident al Statelor Unite. În caz contrar, această Politică de confidențialitate și toate celelalte aspecte vor fi interpretate în conformitate cu legile provinciale/statale și federale ale jurisdicției în care locuiți. Jurisdicțiile din afara reședinței dvs. pot avea legi privind confidențialitatea diferite de cele din jurisdicția dvs., inclusiv dreptul autorităților de aplicare a legii și guvernamentale de a accesa Informațiile cu caracter personal.  În măsura în care prelucrăm date în afara țării dvs., efectuăm o evaluare a impactului asupra confidențialității pentru a stabili că Furnizorii noștri de servicii pot oferi în mod substanțial același nivel de protecție ca cel impus în jurisdicția dvs. și că pot încheia contracte pentru a consolida și mai mult obligațiile de a prelucra în mod adecvat Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal.

10\. SECURITATE
===============

Am implementat măsuri de securitate tehnice și organizatorice menite să protejeze Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal împotriva pierderii accidentale și împotriva accesului, utilizării, distrugerii, modificării și divulgării neautorizate. Cu toate acestea, vă rugăm să rețineți că internetul nu este un mediu 100% sigur. Este responsabilitatea dvs. să protejați securitatea informațiilor dvs. de conectare, să fiți precaut atunci când transmiteți orice Informații cu caracter personal prin e-mailuri, mesagerie instantanee și mijloace similare de comunicare și să mențineți bune practici de securitate pe internet. Nu vă vom trimite niciodată un e-mail pentru a vă solicita parola sau alte informații de conectare la cont. Dacă primiți un astfel de e-mail, vă rugăm să ni-l trimiteți pentru a putea investiga.

1. MODUL ÎN CARE RĂSPUNDEM LA SEMNALELE DO NOT TRACK.

Unele browsere web transmit semnale „do not track” (DNT/GPC) către site-urile și alte servicii online cu care comunică browser-ul dvs. web. În prezent nu există niciun standard care să reglementeze ce anume trebuie să facă site-urile, dacă este cazul să ia vreo măsură, atunci când primesc aceste semnale; cu toate acestea, avem în prezent în vigoare măsuri pentru a acționa ca răspuns la aceste semnale.

2. URMĂRIREA COMPORTAMENTULUI TERȚILOR

De asemenea, putem utiliza aceste tehnologii pentru a colecta informații despre activitățile dvs. online în timp și pe site-uri terțe sau alte servicii online sau pentru a asocia Informațiile cu caracter personal cu alte informații colectate în acest mod.

Pentru a vă exercita drepturile de acces, corectare, portabilitate a datelor și ștergere descrise mai sus, vă rugăm să transmiteți o solicitare către noi folosind formularul nostru online disponibil [aici](https://company.plugshare.com/privacy-notice.html#data-form). Doar dvs. sau o persoană pe care ați autorizat-o să acționeze în numele dvs. puteți face o solicitare legată de Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal. De asemenea, puteți face o solicitare în numele copilului dvs. minor. Dacă primim un formular de solicitare de la o persoană pentru exercitarea unui drept în numele dvs., vom solicita o copie a permisiunii dvs. semnată, prin care îi acordați autorizarea de a transmite asemenea solicitări în numele dvs. și vă vom contacta pentru a confirma în mod direct autorizarea respectivă. Puteți face o solicitare pentru accesul la sau portabilitatea datelor doar de două ori într-o perioadă de 12 luni. Este necesar ca solicitarea verificabilă a Consumatorului:

* Să furnizeze suficiente informații care să ne permită să verificăm în mod rezonabil dacă sunteți persoana despre care am colectat Informații cu caracter personal sau dacă un reprezentant autorizat a formulat solicitarea.
* Să descrie solicitarea dvs. cu suficiente detalii care să ne permită să înțelegem, să evaluăm și să răspundem în mod corespunzător.

Nu putem răspunde solicitării dvs. sau nu vă putem furniza Informații cu caracter personal dacă nu vă putem verifica identitatea sau autoritatea de a formula solicitarea și de a confirma că Informațiile cu caracter personal au legătură cu dvs. Efectuarea unei solicitări nu necesită crearea unui cont la noi. Vom utiliza Informațiile cu caracter personal furnizate într-o solicitare numai pentru a verifica identitatea sau autoritatea solicitantului de a formula solicitarea.

Pentru a vă exercita drepturile de a renunța la publicitatea comportamentală în context încrucișat, dreptul de a renunța la publicitatea direcționată sau partajarea Informațiilor cu caracter personal, după cum este descris mai sus, va trebui să renunțați în funcție de platforma pe care vă aflați.  Rețineți că solicitarea dvs. de a renunța este specifică dispozitivului și platformei pe care transmiteți solicitarea respectivă, așadar este posibil să fie nevoie să înaintați mai multe solicitări dacă intenționați să renunțați la aceste activități de prelucrare specifice pentru mai multe dispozitive și platforme. Vă rugăm să faceți clic:

### Procesul de verificare

La primirea unei solicitări de accesare a datelor, corectare, portabilitate a datelor sau ștergere de la dvs., vă vom trimite un e-mail în termen de 10 zile lucrătoare la adresa de e-mail pe care o avem înregistrată pentru dvs. la dosar. E-mailul vă va solicita să răspundeți pentru a vă verifica în calitate de Consumator care face solicitarea. La primirea verificării dvs., vom corela informațiile dvs. cu cele din dosarul nostru. După verificarea identității dvs., vom continua să prelucrăm solicitarea dvs. și vom răspunde în termen de 45 de zile calendaristice, cu excepția cazului în care (a) nu putem verifica solicitarea dvs., (b) nu putem să vă corelăm cu informațiile din baza noastră de date sau (c) există o excepție în temeiul legii care ne scutește să îndeplinim solicitarea dvs. Dacă avem nevoie de mai mult timp (până la patruzeci și cinci (45) de zile calendaristice suplimentare), vă vom informa în scris despre motivul și perioada de prelungire.

Dacă nu suntem în măsură să vă onorăm solicitarea, răspunsul pe care vi-l furnizăm va explica motivele corespunzătoare. Pentru solicitările de portabilitate a datelor, vom selecta un format pentru a furniza Informațiile dvs. cu caracter personal care este ușor de utilizat și ar trebui să vă permită să transmiteți informațiile de la o entitate la alta fără obstacole.

Nu percepem o taxă pentru a prelucra sau a răspunde la solicitarea dvs. verificabilă a Consumatorului, cu excepția cazului în care este excesivă, repetitivă sau nefondată în mod evident. Dacă stabilim că solicitarea necesită o taxă, vă vom informa de ce am luat decizia respectivă și vă vom furniza o estimare a costurilor înainte de a finaliza solicitarea.

1. ### PREZENTARE GENERALĂ
    

Următoarele prevederi se aplică numai dacă sunteți un rezident din SEE, Regatul Unit sau Elveția (denumite în această Secțiune „Regiunea UE”).

Pentru acești rezidenți, toate prelucrările Informațiilor dvs. cu caracter personal sunt efectuate în conformitate cu drepturile și reglementările privind confidențialitatea, în special Regulamentul (UE) 2016/679 al Parlamentului European și al Consiliului din 27 aprilie 2016, cunoscut sub denumirea de Regulamentul general privind protecția datelor sau Regulamentul general privind protecția datelor din Regatul Unit pentru rezidenții din Regatul Unit (denumite în continuare împreună „RGPD”), iar prelucrarea noastră va fi efectuată în conformitate cu RGPD. În sensul RGPD, vom fi „operatorul de date” al Informațiilor cu caracter personal (denumite și definite în RGPD (disponibil [aici](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/-fws_PydAsXAe)) „date cu caracter personal”) pe care le colectăm, cu excepția cazului în care colectăm astfel de informații în numele unui „operator de date”, caz în care vom fi „persoana împuternicită de operatorul de date”. Această Politică de confidențialitate nu se aplică site-urilor, aplicațiilor sau serviciilor care nu afișează sau nu fac trimitere la această Politică de confidențialitate sau care afișează sau fac trimitere la o altă politică de confidențialitate. Numai pentru rezidenții și cetățenii din Regiunea UE, în măsura în care orice definiție din această Politică de confidențialitate intră în conflict cu o definiție în temeiul RGPD, definiția RGPD va prevala.

Oferim o protecție adecvată transferului Informațiilor cu caracter personal către țări din afara Regiunii UE, prin una sau mai multe din următoarele metode: (a) o serie de acorduri inter-companii bazate pe sau care încorporează Clauzele contractuale standard, (b) ne putem baza pe deciziile de adecvare ale Comisiei Europene cu privire la anumite țări, după caz, (c) putem obține consimțământul dvs. pentru aceste transferuri de date din Regiunea UE către Statele Unite ale Americii și alte țări, (d) putem adopta reguli corporative obligatorii, sau (e) în măsura aplicabilă, ne putem baza pe derogări prevăzute de Articolul 49 din RGPD pentru transferul și transferul ulterior al Informațiilor cu caracter personal colectate de la persoane fizice din Regiunea UE către Statele Unite și alte țări despre care Regiunea UE consideră că nu oferă o protecție adecvată a datelor. În ceea ce privește metoda (e), putem transfera Informații cu caracter personal către o terță parte pentru a îndeplini un contract încheiat cu dvs., cu consimțământul dvs. explicit sau într-un mod care să nu anuleze drepturile și libertățile dvs. Dacă aceste Informații cu caracter personal nu sunt prelucrate și transferate, nu vom putea îndeplini contractul încheiat cu dvs. sau nu veți avea acces la niciunul sau toate beneficiile și caracteristicile asociate tranzacției dvs.

De asemenea, este posibil să fie necesar să transferăm informațiile dvs. către alte companii din grup sau furnizori de servicii din țări din afara Regiunii UE. Acest lucru se poate întâmpla dacă serverele sau furnizorii și prestatorii noștri de servicii se află în afara Regiunii UE sau dacă utilizați Produsele și/sau Serviciile noastre în timp ce vizitați țări din afara acestor zone.
