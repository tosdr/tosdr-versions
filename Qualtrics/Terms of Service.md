General Terms and Conditions
============================

Regardless of which Qualtrics Cloud Services, professional services or research  
services you purchase, there is one set of foundational terms for them all - the General  
Terms and Conditions, which we call the **GTCs**.  
  
This means you don’t have to spend time reviewing different terms every time  
you make a new purchase. The GTCs will apply to all of your contracts with Qualtrics.

TermScout

We are not the only ones who think our terms are fair to our customers. Our GTCs have been reviewed and certified as ‘Customer Favorable’ by TermScout, an independent contract rating company.

[See TermScout review](https://app.termscout.com/certify/qualtrics-certified-contract/)

English General Terms and Conditions

If a valid agreement exists between you (“Customer”) and Qualtrics, LLC (“Qualtrics”) related to the subject matter hereof, those terms take precedence over these terms unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in relation to a specific Order Form. **Modifications to this Agreement**. Qualtrics may modify these GTC at any time by posting a revised version on this website ([http://www.qualtrics.com/legal/customers/gtcs/](https://www.qualtrics.com/terms-of-service/www.qualtrics.com/legal/customers/gtcs/)) or otherwise providing notice to Customer. By continuing to use the services after the effective date of any modifications to these GTC, Customer agrees to be bound by the modified terms. Some services may be subject to additional terms specific to those services as set forth in the Product Terms [https://www.qualtrics.com/legal/customers/product-terms/](https://www.qualtrics.com/legal/customers/product-terms/), which are incorporated herein to the extent applicable. **United States Federal Government Agency:** if you are a United States federal government agency, use of the Services is subject to [this amendment](https://www.qualtrics.com/amendment-terms-of-service/). **Australian Small Businesses:** if your contract with Qualtrics is a Small Business Contract for the purposes of the Treasury Laws Amendment (More Competition, Better Prices) Act 2022 (Cth), use of the services is subject to [this amendment](https://www.qualtrics.com/legal/customers/au-amendment/). **Online Payments:** if you have purchased your services online, the purchase of those services is subject to [this amendment](https://www.qualtrics.com/legal/customers/online-amendment/).

Translated General Terms and Conditions

As a global company, we recognise that English may not always be the easiest language for our customers to review. As a result, we have drafted bilingual versions of the GTCs in our most in-demand alternative languages.  
  
Please click the following links to access our translated GTCs. Each non-English translation is provided for convenience only and is not valid or legally binding. In case of a conflict between the English version and any translation, the English version will control.
