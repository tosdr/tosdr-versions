Our retreats have specific terms and conditions, which are sent in advance to all potential participants.

Health responsibilities, including fitness for yoga and other activities, are also the guest's responsibility. Our cancellation policy varies depending on the timing of the cancellation, with different terms for cancellations made more than 21 days in advance versus those made within 21 days of the retreat start. Amendments and cancellations by us, liability details, and privacy policy are also covered.
