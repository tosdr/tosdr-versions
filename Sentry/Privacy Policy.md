    1. ### [](#roles-and-regulatory-compliance-authorization)Roles and Regulatory Compliance; Authorization.
        
        1. _Scope of this DPA._ This DPA applies where and only to the extent Sentry processes Personal Data as a Processor for the purposes of Privacy Laws.
            
        2. _Roles and Responsibilities._ The parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) Sentry will process the Personal Data as described in Schedule 1; (ii) Sentry is a Processor of Personal Data and Customer is the Controller (or a Processor acting on behalf of a third-party Controller); and (iii) each of us will comply with our obligations under Privacy Laws with respect to the processing of Personal Data.
            
        3. _Authorization by Third Party Controller._ If you are a Processor of Personal Data acting on behalf of a third-party Controller: (i) you warrant to us that your instructions and actions with respect to that Personal Data, including your appointment of Sentry as another Processor, have been authorized by the relevant Controller; and (ii) you will serve as our sole point of contact and where we would otherwise be required (including for the purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses) to provide information, assistance or cooperation to or seek authorization from any such third-party Controllers, we may provide such information, assistance or cooperation to or seek such authorization from you.
            
    2. ### [](#customer-responsibilities)Customer responsibilities.

We will not process Personal Data for any other purpose, unless required to do so by applicable law or regulation. The parties agree that the Agreement (including this DPA), and your use of the Service in accordance with the Agreement, set out your complete and final processing instructions and any processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between the parties. Customer shall ensure its instructions are lawful and that the processing of Personal Data in accordance with such instructions will not violate Privacy Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Processor of Personal Data acting on behalf of a third-party Controller then where legally required we are entitled to follow the instructions of such third-party Controller with respect to their Personal Data.
            
        2. _Prohibition on Sensitive Data._ You will not submit, store, or send any sensitive personal information or special categories of personal data (collectively, “Sensitive Data”) to us for processing, and you will not permit nor authorize any of your employees, agents, contractors or data subjects to submit, store or send any Sensitive Data to us for processing. You acknowledge that we do not request or require Sensitive Data as part of providing the Service to you, that we do not wish to receive or store Sensitive Data, and that our obligations in this DPA will not apply with respect to Sensitive Data.

If you use the Service to delete any Personal Data in a manner that would prevent you from recovering Personal Data at a future time, you agree that this will constitute an instruction to us to delete Personal Data from our systems in accordance with our standard processes and applicable law. We will comply with this instruction as soon as reasonably practicable, but in all events in accordance with applicable law.
        
    2. ### [](#deletion-when-term-expires)Deletion When Term Expires.

You acknowledge that you will be responsible for exporting, before the Term expires, any Personal Data you want to retain after the Term expires.

Sentry shall ensure that any person who is authorized by Sentry to process Personal Data shall be under an appropriate obligation of confidentiality (whether a contractual or statutory duty). Customer acknowledges that Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and that accordingly we may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Service.
        
    2. ### [](#data-incidents)Data Incidents.
        
        Upon becoming aware of a Data Incident, we will notify you promptly and without undue delay, and will take reasonable steps to minimize harm and secure Personal Data.

We will not assess the contents of any Personal Data in order to identify information that may be subject to specific legal requirements. You are solely responsible for complying with any incident notification laws that may apply to you, and to fulfilling any third-party notification obligations related to any Data Incident.

        1. _Audit Reports._ You acknowledge that Sentry is regularly audited against various information security standards by independent third-party auditors and internal auditors, respectively.

Further, we will provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all reasonable requests for information necessary to confirm our compliance with this DPA, provided that you will not exercise this right more than once per calendar year.
            
        2. _Independent Audits._ While it is the parties’ intention to rely ordinarily on the provision of the above audit reports to verify our compliance with this DPA, we will allow an internationally-recognized independent auditor that you select to conduct audits to verify our compliance with our obligations under this DPA. You must send any requests for audits under this Section 4.4.2 to [legal@sentry.io.](mailto:legal@sentry.io.) Following our receipt of your request, the parties will discuss and agree in advance on the reasonable start date, scope, duration and security and confidentiality controls applicable to the audit.

    2. ### [](#list-of-subprocessors)List of Subprocessors.
        
        A list of our current Subprocessors is available at [https://sentry.io/legal/subprocessors/](https://sentry.io/legal/subprocessors/) or such other website as Sentry may designate (“Subprocessor Page”).

Notwithstanding this, we shall use reasonable efforts to require Subprocessors to permit us to disclose Subprocessor agreements to you and, in any event, will provide (upon request and on a confidential basis) all information we reasonably can in connection with such Subprocessor agreement.

[](#schedule-3)Schedule 3
-------------------------

### [](#cross-border-transfer-mechanisms)Cross-Border Transfer Mechanisms

1. **Data Privacy Framework**. Sentry complies with the Data Privacy Framework in relation to transfers of Personal Data from Europe to the United States. The parties agree that Sentry will use the Data Privacy Framework to lawfully receive European Personal Data in the United States and Sentry will ensure that we provide at least the same level of protection to such data as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles. Sentry will notify Customer if we make a determination that we can no longer comply with our obligations under the Data Privacy Framework.
    
2. **Standard Contractual Clauses**. In the event that the Data Privacy Framework is invalidated, or the Data Privacy Framework does not otherwise apply to the transfer of European Personal Data from Customer to Sentry, then the parties agree to be subject to, abide by, and process such European Personal Data in compliance with the SCCs as follows:
    
    1. **EEA Transfers**. If the GDPR applies to the European Personal Data:
        
        (i) Module 2 (Controller to Processor) applies where Customer is a Controller of European Personal Data and Sentry is a Processor of European Personal Data;
        
        (ii) Module 3 (Processor to Processor) applies where Customer is a Processor of European Personal Data (on behalf of a third-party Controller) and Sentry is a Processor of European Personal Data;
        
        (iii) Customer is the “data exporter” and Sentry is the “data importer”;
        
        (iv) by entering into this DPA, each party is deemed to have signed the SCCs (including their Annexes) as of the effective date of this DPA; and
        
        (v) for each Module, where applicable, the following applies:
        
        (a) the optional docking clause in Clause 7 applies;
        
        (b) in Clause 9, option 2 will apply, the minimum time period for prior notice of Subprocessor changes shall be as set out in Section 7.2 (List of Subprocessors) of this DPA and Sentry shall fulfill its notification obligations by notifying Customer of any Subprocessor changes in accordance with Section 7.2 (List of Subprocessors) of this DPA;
        
        (c) in Clause 11, the optional language does not apply;
        
        (d) in Clause 13, all square brackets are removed with the text remaining;
        
        (e) in Clause 17, Option 1 will apply, and the SCCs will be governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland;
        
        (f) in Clause 18(b), disputes will be resolved before the courts of the Republic of Ireland; and
        
        (g) Schedules 1 and 2 and Section 7.2 (List of Subprocessors) of this DPA contain the information required in Annex 1 and 2 of the SCCs.
        
    2. **UK Transfers**. If the UK GDPR applies to the European Personal Data, the SCCs as incorporated under Section 2.1 (EEA Transfers) of this Schedule 3 shall apply with the following modifications: (i) the SCCs shall be amended as specified by the UK Addendum, which shall be incorporated by reference; (ii) Tables 1 to 3 in Part 1 of the UK Addendum shall be populated with the information from Schedules 1 and 2 and Section 7.2 (List of Subprocessors) of this DPA; (iii) Table 4 in Part 1 of the UK Addendum shall be deemed completed by selecting “importer”; and (iv) any conflict between the SCCs and the UK Addendum shall be resolved in accordance with Section 10 and Section 11 of the UK Addendum.
        
    3. **Swiss Transfers**. If the Swiss FADP applies to the European Personal Data, the SCCs as incorporated under Section 2.1 (EEA Transfers) of this Schedule 3 shall apply with the following modifications: (i) references to “Regulation (EU) 2016/679” shall be interpreted as references to the Swiss FADP; (ii) references to “EU,” “Union,” and “Member State” shall be replaced with “Switzerland”; (iii) references to the “competent supervisory authority” and “competent courts” shall be interpreted as references to the “Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner” and the “competent Swiss courts”; and (iv) the SCCs shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland and disputes shall be resolved before the competent Swiss courts.
        
    4. **Additional Provisions**. Where this Section 2 applies, it is not the intention of either party to contradict or restrict any of the provisions set forth in the SCCs and, accordingly, if and to the extent the SCCs conflict with any provision of the Agreement (including this DPA), the SCCs shall prevail to the extent of such conflict. In particular, nothing in this DPA shall exclude the rights of third-party beneficiaries granted under the SCCs. You agree that in the event we cannot ensure compliance with the SCCs, we will inform you promptly and you will provide us with a reasonable period of time to cure any non-compliance. You will reasonably cooperate with us to agree what additional safeguards or measures, if any, may be reasonably required to cure the non-compliance and will only be entitled to suspend the transfer of European Personal Data and/or terminate the affected parts of the Service if we have not or cannot cure the non-compliance before the end of the cure period.
        
3. **Alternative Transfer Solution**. With respect to European Personal Data, you agree that if we adopt an alternative data transfer mechanism (including any new version of, or successor to, the SCCs or Data Privacy Framework adopted pursuant to applicable European Data Protection Legislation) for European Personal Data not described in this DPA (“Alternative Transfer Solution”), the Alternative Transfer Solution shall apply instead of the transfer mechanisms described in this DPA (but only to the extent such Alternative Transfer Solution complies with applicable European Data Protection Legislation and extends to the territories to which European Personal Data is transferred), and if we request that you take any action (including, without limitation, execution of documents) reasonably required to give full effect to that solution, you will promptly do so.
