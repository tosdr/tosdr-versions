The collection and use of personal information for any other purpose than described herein requires supplemental and more specific notification or consent. Please see [University Privacy Notices and Consent Forms](https://www.washington.edu/privacy/) website for specific examples.

### **Disclosure or Sharing of Information**

The UW may use third party service providers and suppliers to facilitate this website or the services the UW provides. Those providers and suppliers may have access to the information the UW collects in order to fulfill their obligations to the UW.  The UW is a state agency, and as such may disclose or share information in recognition of applicable state, federal, or international laws.

Finally, to the extent allowed by law, you may withdraw consent you have given to certain data processing, without penalty. If you do decide to withdraw consent at a later date, your withdrawal will not affect the legality of the processing of your data up to that point.

The individual responsible for decisions about the online collection, use and protection of personal data that is described herein and is subject to EU GDPR is identified as the EU GDPR Controller on the organizational website.
