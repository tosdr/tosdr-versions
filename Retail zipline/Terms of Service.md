These TERMS AND CONDITIONS (the “Agreement”) govern your use of the retail field communication service provided as an online, hosted solution, which may also be provided through a mobile application, (the “Service”) offered by Retail Zipline, Inc. (“Zipline”, “we” or “us”). Specific business terms associated with your subscription to the Service will be an order form executed by the parties that reference this Agreement (“Order Form”). This Agreement governs all Order Forms; any conflicting or additional terms, conditions, or obligations are of no force or effect unless agreed to in a writing signed by the parties. This Agreement is a legally binding contract between the entity accepting it (“you” or “your” or “Client”) and Zipline and is effective as long as any Order Form remains in effect. This Agreement is applicable to (a) the Client who initially sets up the Service and other employees that are granted ownership privileges by you, (b) employees who manage and run your organization that will publish information through the Service (“Publishers”), and c) employees who consume the information published through the Service by Publishers (“Members”). This Agreement must be accepted prior to accessing or using the Service. Do not access or use the Service if you are unwilling or unable to be bound by this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

1. **Scope of the Services**. In accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Service will be available to the Publishers and Members you authorize to use the service (collectively, “**Users**”). Your Users may use and have access to the Service and the associated generally published technical documentation for the Service (“**Documentation**”) provided such use and access is for your own internal business operations (and not for the benefit of a third party). If there are restrictions on your use of the Service, such as a limitation on the number or types of registered Users that may use the Service such restrictions will be in the applicable Order Form; you agree to use and access the Service in compliance with those restrictions. For the avoidance of doubt this Agreement only permits you to access and use the Service and you will not receive or have access to a copy of the code or software that underlies the Service (collectively the “**Software**”) or receive a copy of the Service itself.
2. **Support**. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Zipline will endeavor to provide you with reasonable support for the Service through telephone, electronic mail or another online mechanism, in accordance with Zipline’s support offerings, which may be updated by Zipline from time to time.
3. **Updates**. As our business evolves, Zipline may change this Agreement, the Services, or the Documentation. If we make a material change to the Agreement, the Services, or the Documentation we will provide you with reasonable prior notice either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice in the Service. You can review the most current version of the Agreement at any time by visiting this page. The revised terms and conditions will become effective on the date they are posted at this page, and if you use the Service after that date, your use will constitute acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to this Agreement is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to cancel your account and stop using the Services, which you may do by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://www.retailzipline.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
4. **Restrictions**. Our reputation and the Service are important to us and we know your reputation is important to you.

Absent the execution of a Change Order, the parties will proceed to fulfill their obligations under the applicable Order Form in accordance with its original terms.
9. **Zipline’s Ownership**. Zipline owns the Service, the Software, any underlying infrastructure, and anything Zipline creates or invents in the course of performing the Professional Services (collectively the “**Zipline Materials**”).

The Receiving Party also agrees that, even within the Receiving Party, Confidential Information will be disseminated only to those employees, officers and directors with a clear and well-defined “need to know” purpose and who are informed of and bound by the obligations of this Agreement or a substantially similar agreement with terms just as protective of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as the terms of this Agreement.

You agree that we are free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute and exploit any Feedback as we sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise.c. _Data Collection_.

Overdue Fees are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower. If you fail to pay any invoices in accordance with Section 13.2, we may suspend your use of and access to the Service pending payment of such overdue invoices; provided that we give you notice of such non-payment and ten (10) days (from the date of such notice) to remit the overdue fees in full.
