THIS REALSENSE PRIVACY POLICY WAS ISSUED ON 25th MAY, 2018.

REALSENSE Solutions Ltd (REALSENSE) and organisations associated with REALSENSE as part of the provision of the REALSENSE Websites and REALSENSE Online Services (“REALSENSE”, “we” or “us”) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

REALSENSE does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. This policy discloses the privacy practices for the REALSENSE Websites and REALSENSE Online Services. We use the information we collect about you including from the REALSENSE Website to process orders and maintain a relationship with you throughout the use of our products and services. This policy explains how your personal information is protected. It is our intent to give you as much control as possible over your privacy and personal information and the use we make of it in our business. This policy is subject to change, so please check back from time to time to stay informed.

REALSENSE respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy notice will inform you as to how we look after your personal data when you visit our REALSENSE websites and REALSENSE Online Services (regardless of where you visit from) and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

Please see the ‘Definitions’ section to understand the meaning of some of the terms used.

1\. IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WHO WE ARE
----------------------------------------

### PURPOSE OF THIS PRIVACY NOTICE

This privacy notice aims to give you information on how REALSENSE collects and processes your personal data through your use of REALSENSE websites and REALSENSE Online Services including any data you may provide through this website when you sign up to our newsletter, purchase a product or service, complete a survey or take part in a competition.

The REALSENSE websites, products and online services are intended for adult learners (aged 18 and above), not children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.

It is important that you read this privacy notice together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This privacy notice supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.

### CONTROLLER

In order to access elements of our REALSENSE Websites and or our REALSENSE Online Services, and complete orders and or access training, resources and or other associated activities, users require an account. Having an account means REALSENSE is storing the personal data you provide, and we further process this to complete registrations and orders as well as determine training and compliance outcomes and retain certification records as well as analyse content and system usage, improve our products and services and respond to support queries and evaluation comments. Where a learner has accessed or is allocated a REALSENSE product via our REALSENSE Website and or REALSENSE Online Services, then REALSENSE is the data controller.

If your login details or training has been provided by a 3rd party (e.g. your employer, another organisation or a REALSENSE approved partner or reseller) then they will be joint data controller, along with REALSENSE where applicable, and also have access to and will be processing your personal data. Should you require any further information you should contact them directly. If you are unsure who to contact, REALSENSE may be able to assist, please email info@real-sense.com . Where a 3rd party has provided system access, and no REALSENSE content is allocated to the user, then REALSENSE is a data processer, and the relevant 3rd party sole data controller.

REALSENSE retains user compliance and competency records on an ongoing basis, under its commitment to compliance and lifelong learning, to enable us to provide factual information on what a user has accessed, completed, studied and achieved, i.e. name, courses studies, products and resources accessed, CPD gained, test results etc. This is in line with JISC best practice and Guidance on Managing Student Records.

As part of our work to be GDPR compliant we need to make sure that you and or your organisation understand your role as a Data Controller and the responsibilities that come with this. You and or your organisation are responsible for the data uploaded to the REALSENSE Website(s) and or REALSENSE Online Services individual/ organisation account area and acknowledge that REALSENSE is the Data Processor.

You and or your organisation are responsible for the information uploaded to the REALSENSE Website and or REALSENSE Online Services and you must gain prior consent from anyone whose personally identifiable information uploaded to share the content with REALSENSE for the purposes set out and in accordance with the REALSENSE Website and Online Services Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.

From time to time, it may be necessary for REALSENSE to temporarily act for you and or on your organisation administrator’s behalf in the capacity of a data controller in order to provide administrative and or technical support to you and your organisation’s users using the REALSENSE Website and or REALSENSE Online Services.

REALSENSE Solutions Ltd is the Data Controller for certain aspects of its provision and is responsible for some personal data (collectively referred to as ”COMPANY”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this privacy notice).

We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy notice. If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the Data Protection Officer using the details set out in this privacy policy.

### CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY NOTICE AND YOUR DUTY TO INFORM US OF CHANGES

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current and it is your responsibility to keep your and or the personal data of the individuals within your organisation up to date and or keep us informed if personal data changes during your relationship with us.

### PROMOTIONAL OFFERS FROM US

We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.

You may receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

### THIRD-PARTY MARKETING

We will seek and ensure your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside REALSENSE for marketing purposes.

### OPTING OUT

You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us directly.

### COOKIES

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our **Cookie Policy**.

### CHANGE OF PURPOSE

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please **contact us**.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

5\. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
-------------------------------------

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.

* Selected external third parties for the purpose of fulfilling the terms of contract with you.
* Specific third parties such as Google, Amazon or Slack.
* Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
* We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions

6\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
---------------------------

If any of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) then their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is adhered to.

7\. DATA SECURITY
-----------------

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

8\. DATA RETENTION
------------------

### HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting us.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see request erasure below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

9\. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see definitions in glossary:

### DATA SUBJECT ACCESS REQUEST FEES

An individual or organisation making a data subject access request (or to exercise any of the other rights) must pay a fee of £10. The request will be acted upon once the fee has been received. We may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

### WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

### TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<br>* Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. |
