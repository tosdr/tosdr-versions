Activbase Terms and Conditions
==============================

THE ACTIVBASE SERVICES TERMS AND CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED AS OF 24 MAY, 2018 TO THE BELOW.

Activbase is a registered trademark of REALSENSE Solutions Ltd ("REALSENSE") and REALSENSE offers Activbase platform and content solutions.

The Activbase Platform is an online service used for administrating, distributing and managing information, resources, learning and assessment content as well as compliance and competency tools to registered users of a subscribing organisation / administrator. The Activbase Platform is produced and owned by REALSENSE Solutions Ltd ('REALSENSE').

Please read this Agreement carefully. By selecting "I AGREE" (and/or by continuing to use the Activbase site), you confirm your agreement to these terms on behalf of the organisation (and/or person if one user licence) that has been registered, and you confirm that you personally are authorised to accept this agreement on that organisation's (or person's) behalf. This is a binding legal agreement.

REALSENSE Online Services Subscription Agreement  
for Activbase Services
=========================================================================

This REALSENSE Services Subscription Agreement (the "Agreement" or "Terms of Use") governs the use of Activbase Services by the organisation registered by you (the "Customer"), as licensed by REALSENSE Solutions Ltd ("REALSENSE") and will be effective when accepted by the Customer in connection with separate Orders. This Agreement combined with the Order constitutes a complete binding legal agreement between REALSENSE and the Customer and sets forth the terms and conditions that govern the Activbase platform and content, and other Services (collectively, the "Services") provided by REALSENSE, its affiliates, agents, or associates, or contractors to the Customer – please read carefully. The terms of this Agreement are subject to change after 30 days' notice is given by REALSENSE via this website, and as such the Customer is solely responsible for checking this website for changes to this Agreement. This Agreement will supersede any prior discussions or representations regarding the Services. If there is a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and an Order, the terms and conditions of the Order will prevail, but only with respect to the Services licensed through that particular Order. The parties agree as follows:

CUSTOMER'S USE OF THE SERVICES
------------------------------

1.1. Free Trials. Should the Customer agree to this Agreement as part of a free trial, then this section 1.1 shall apply. When the Customer first agrees to these terms, REALSENSE allows for a thirty (30) day free trial ("Free Trial Period") of the Services for no more than five (5) Authorised Persons to use the Services on behalf of the Customer with no payment obligation and no obligation of continued subscription past the Free Trial Period. REALSENSE shall have the right to immediately suspend Services upon expiration of the Customer's Free Trial Period. To avoid any such interruption of Services, the Customer may elect to continue using the Services after its Free Trial Period by accepting in writing, REALSENSE's written Order (Booking Form), which will set forth the Services, the subscription Term, the number of users (and how defined), pricing, fees and reference to this Agreement (collectively, the "Order"). The Customer acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement will govern the Customer's use of Services during a Free Trial Period and any paid subscription Term for which the Customer accepts an Order.

ANY CUSTOMER DATA THAT THE CUSTOMER ENTERS INTO THE SERVICES DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD MAY BE PERMANENTLY LOST UNLESS THE CUSTOMER PURCHASES A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SAME SERVICES AS THOSE COVERED BY THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD. THE CUSTOMER MUST EXPORT ITS CUSTOMER DATA BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD TO AVOID THE RISK THAT THE CUSTOMER DATA WILL BE PERMANENTLY LOST.

1.2 Provision of the Services. REALSENSE will make available to the Customer on a subscription basis for the Term the Services set forth in an Order pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Order. Services are designed to be available 24/7 subject to maintenance. The Customer will be notified of scheduled maintenance. REALSENSE will, as part of providing a Service, apply any update, bug fix or upgrade to the Service that it makes generally available to its Customers of the Service. Services are subject to usage limits, including for example, the quantities specified in an accepted Order. REALSENSE will comply with all Laws applicable to it in connection with its provision of the Services to the Customer. REALSENSE reserves the right to modify the platform and content offerings including content of the online product library at any time.

1.3 Customer Obligations. The Customer may enable access of the Services for use only by Authorised Persons solely for the internal business purposes of the Customer and its Affiliates in accordance with this Agreement and not for the benefit of any third parties. The Customer is responsible for all Authorised Persons' use of the Services and compliance with this Agreement and the applicable Order(s). The Customer shall: (a) have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of all the Customer Data that is transmitted or otherwise provided to REALSENSE and the means by which the Customer acquired the Customer Data; (b) ensure that its employees receive any required disclosures and appropriate training concerning the use of the Services; (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorised access to, or use of, the Services, and notify REALSENSE promptly of any such unauthorised access or use; and (d) shall use the Services(s) only in accordance with this Agreement, the Documentation and the applicable Law. The Customer shall not: (i) use the Services in violation of applicable Laws and regulations; (ii) in connection with the Services, send or store infringing, obscene, threatening, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, including material that violates privacy rights. The Customer shall be liable for the acts and omissions of all Authorised Persons and the Customer Affiliates relating to this Agreement. If the Customer installs or enables a third-party application for use with a REALSENSE Service, the Customer (i) is solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining the license or other rights for its use of the third-party application, and (ii) grants REALSENSE permission to allow the provider of that third-party application to access the Customer Data as required for the interoperation of the third-party application and the REALSENSE Service.

DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY
---------------------------

2.1 Protection and Security. During the Term of this Agreement, REALSENSE shall establish, implement and maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical measures that are designed to protect the security and integrity of the Customer Data that is provided to REALSENSE by the Customer, and that are reasonably appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and nature of the provided the Customer Data to be protected, and designed to guard against the accidental or unauthorised access, use, loss or disclosure of the Customer Data while it is on REALSENSE's network and systems. The Customer understands that it has an independent duty to comply with any and all Laws applicable to it in connection with its provision of the Customer Data to REALSENSE.

2.2 Unauthorised Disclosure.

* If either party believes that there has been unauthorised access, use, loss or disclosure of the Customer Data while it is on REALSENSE's network and systems, such party must promptly notify the other party. Additionally, each party will reasonably assist the other party in investigating, remediating or mitigating any potential damage, including providing reasonable assistance with respect to any legally required notifications concerning the disclosure or the provision of credit reporting services to such individuals. Except as set forth in Section 2.2.B., each party shall bear the costs of such investigation, remediation, mitigation and/or notification associated with an unauthorised disclosure.
* In the event that the unauthorised access, use, loss or disclosure of the Customer Data was caused by breach of REALSENSE's obligations under this Agreement, then REALSENSE shall reimburse the Customer for its reasonable actual out-of-pocket costs to investigate and/or remediate such disclosure and provide legally required notifications to the affected users, subject to the cap on liability in Article 9. This Section 2.2.B states REALSENSE's sole liability for unauthorised access, use, loss or disclosure of the Customer Data attributable to REALSENSE's breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

FEES AND PAYMENT
----------------

3.1 Fees and Payment Terms. The Fees shall be set out in each Order. The Customer will pay REALSENSE's invoice within thirty days of REALSENSE's invoice date. All undisputed invoices are due and payable by the Customer net 30 days, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties signed in writing (however, the Customer's payment will not be considered overdue for any unpaid amounts disputed in good faith on an invoice-by-invoice basis.) REALSENSE will also invoice the Customer at the time the Customer adds any enhanced or additional Services. However, if the Customer exceeds the usage limitation (i.e. number of licensed users) set forth in the Order, REALSENSE will invoice the Customer for excesses in arrears by agreement. Fees will be billed and paid in GBP, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.

3.2 Taxes. Excluding taxes based on REALSENSE's income, the Customer is liable for all taxes relating to the Services, except to the extent the Customer has provided REALSENSE with a valid tax exemption or direct pay certificate.

CONFIDENTIALITY
---------------

4.1 Confidential Information Defined.

* "Confidential Information" means all information disclosed by a party ("Discloser") to the other party ("Recipient"), orally or in writing, designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstance of disclosure. The Customer's Confidential Information includes the Customer Data; REALSENSE Confidential Information includes the Services, REALSENSE Content and Documentation; and Confidential Information of each party includes the terms of this Agreement and each Order (including signed order forms or statements of work entered under this Agreement), each party's proprietary technology and technical information, business processes and technical product information, product plans and designs, issues, and all communication between the Parties regarding the Services.
* Exclusions. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the other party; (ii) was known to a party prior to its disclosure by the other party without breach of any obligation owed to the other party; (iii) was independently developed by a party without breach of any obligation owed to the other party; (iv) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the other party; or (v) is Aggregated Data as described further in Section 5.5.

4.2 Confidentiality Obligations. During the course of the parties' relationship, each party may have access to Confidential Information of the other party. Neither party shall disclose any Confidential Information of the other party, orally or in writing, to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party, except as provided in this Agreement. The parties shall protect each other's Confidential Information using commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards. REALSENSE adheres to commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical measures for protection of the Customer's Confidential Information. Neither party shall use the other party's Confidential Information for any purpose other than lawful performance of this Agreement.

4.3 Disclosure to Third Parties and as Required by Law. Recipient may provide access to and use of Discloser's Confidential Information only to those third parties that: (a) provide services to Recipient concerning Recipient's use of Discloser's Confidential Information; (b) have a need to use and access the Confidential Information; and (c) have agreed to substantially similar non-disclosure obligations as those contained in this Agreement. Recipient shall be responsible for the use by its third parties of the Discloser's Confidential Information. To the extent Recipient may be required by Law to disclose Confidential Information, Recipient may make such disclosure, provided that Recipient (i) to the extent permitted by Law, notifies Discloser of such requirement prior to disclosure and (ii) makes diligent efforts to avoid and limit disclosure. Notwithstanding Recipient's conformance with the procedures set forth in the prior sentence, the disclosure required by Law shall not itself cause the information to lose its confidential character unless the information ceases to be Confidential Information as a result of one of the reasons specifically set forth in Section 4.1.B above.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
--------------------------------------------

5.1 Ownership and Reservation of Rights to REALSENSE Solutions Ltd. REALSENSE owns all right, title and interest in and to the Services, Documentation, REALSENSE Content, and other REALSENSE Technology, as well as any modifications that are derivative works thereof. Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, REALSENSE reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the Services, Documentation, and REALSENSE Content, including all related common law, statutory and other industrial property rights and intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and other proprietary rights issued, honoured or enforceable under any applicable laws anywhere in the world, and all moral rights related thereto.

REALSENSE further grants to the Customer:

* Solely during the Term, the right to download and use the Learning Resources or portions thereof in combination with the Customer's (non-REALSENSE) learning material, with the express obligation that the Customer remove and return or destroy all Learning Resources upon expiration or termination of the Term; REALSENSE may audit the Customer's compliance with this post-Term obligation once annually for the two years following expiration or termination of this Agreement.

Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting REALSENSE from utilising the Aggregated Data for purposes of operating REALSENSE's business, provided that REALSENSE's use of Aggregated Data will not reveal the identity, whether directly or indirectly, of any individual or specific data entered by any individual into the Services. In no event does the Aggregated Data include any Customer Confidential Information, Customer Data or any information that personally identifies a specific individual.

TERM, TERMINATION, SUSPENSION, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
-----------------------------------------------------

6.1 Term. This Agreement shall have a term commencing as of the Effective Date and ending upon expiration or termination of all Orders issued hereunder. Each Order shall have a term commencing on its effective date and, unless otherwise set forth therein or upon its termination, or the termination of this Agreement, shall expire one (1) year after its effective date.

6.2 Termination for Default. Either party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety or any specific Order if the other party breaches any material term of these General Terms or the applicable Order and does not cure such material breach within sixty (60) days of receiving a Termination Notice.

6.3 Effect of Expiration or Termination. When this Agreement or any Order expires or is terminated, the Customer shall pay all money due to REALSENSE for Services rendered up to the expiration or termination date and any payments that may become due pursuant to this Agreement subsequent to such expiration or termination. The Customer also agrees to immediately stop using the Services and accessing the software, content library, and REALSENSE Content upon expiration or termination of the Order(s) and/or Agreement and both parties agree to stop using the Confidential Information of the other party and to return or destroy (at the party's discretion) all the copies of the other party's Confidential Information. To the extent the Recipient is required to keep a copy of any of the Discloser's Confidential Information as required by applicable law, the Recipient shall continue to treat such Discloser's Confidential Information as Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

6.4 Dispute Resolution. Prior to instituting formal proceedings, the parties shall attempt to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement informally. To invoke this process a party shall appoint a designated executive and request that the other party do the same. The other party shall make such appointment within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request. The designated executives shall then have up to thirty (30) days to attempt in good faith to resolve the matter. The informal dispute resolution process shall terminate at the end of the thirty (30) day period unless extended by mutual agreement. Disputes not resolved by informal dispute resolution as provided in this section will be resolved by litigation unless the parties mutually agree to an alternative dispute resolution method such as arbitration.

Nothing in this section shall prevent, or be construed as preventing, a party from (a) instituting formal proceedings to avoid the expiration of any applicable limitations period, or (b) seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

The parties agree that all negotiations pursuant to this section will be confidential and therefore treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of all similar rules and codes of evidence of applicable legislation and jurisdictions.
