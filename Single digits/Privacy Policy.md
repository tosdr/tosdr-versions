We may use this anonymous data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Service and promote our business.
    
    Marketing and advertising. We and our third-party advertising partners may collect and use your personal information for marketing and advertising purposes:
    
    Direct marketing. We may send you Single Digits-related or other direct marketing communications as permitted by law.

These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about you (including the device data, online activity data and/or geolocation data described above) over time across our Service and other sites and services or your interaction with our emails, and use that information to serve ads that they think will interest you. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising, in the Your Choices section below.

    The Service is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete it.
    
* #### Changes to this Privacy Policy

* #### Important information for California residents
    
    Scope. This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use and share Personal Information of California residents when we act as a “business” as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), and their rights with respect to their Personal Information. This section does not apply when we act as a “service provider” as defined under the CCPA, such as when we process personal information in connection with providing services to our business clients (including when we obtain personal information through our website on the “Support” page or during calls to our support phone numbers). For purposes of this section, “Personal Information” has the meaning given in the CCPA but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA or information we collect from you in the course of providing services to you or receiving services from you where you are an employee, controlling owner, director, officer or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit or government agency. In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, such as job applicants, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.
    
    Your California privacy rights. As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.
    
    Information. You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:
    
    The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.
    
    The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.
    
    The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.
    
    The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.
    
    Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information disclosed to each category of third-party recipient.
    
    Whether we’ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third-party recipient.
    
    Access. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.
    
    Correction. You can ask us to correct inaccurate Personal Information that we have maintain about you.
    
    Deletion. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.
    
    Opt-out of sales. If we sell your Personal Information, you can opt-out. In addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
    
    Opt-in. If we know that you are younger than 16 years old, we will ask for your permission (or if you are younger than 13 years old, your parent’s or guardian’s permission) to sell your Personal Information before we do so.
    
    Nondiscrimination. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination in the form of legally prohibited increases in the price or decreases in the quality of our Service.
    
    You may also have the right to appeal the denial of any of these rights by submitting a form that will be provided to you if we deny a data request.
    
    How to exercise your rights
    
    You may exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:
    
    Right to information, access and deletion. You may exercise your right to information, access or deletion by:
    
    visiting
    
    calling us toll free at
    
    emailing DPO@singledigits.com
    
    Right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information. Like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you. Our use of some of these services may be classified under California law as a “sale” of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services because they collect information from our users (e.g., device data and online activity data) to help them serve ads more likely to interest you. You may request that we not use your personal data with these
    
    Advertising Partners by:
    
    visiting or calling us toll free at emailing DPO@singledigits.com
    
    We reserve the right to confirm your California residency to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your information, access or deletion rights. Government identification may be required. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with enough detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.
    
    Personal information that we collect, use and disclose
    
    The chart below describes the Personal Information we collect by reference to the categories specified in the CCPA and describes our practices during the 12 months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy. Information you voluntarily provide to us, such as in free form webforms, may contain other categories of personal information not described below. Each category is used for the business/commercial purposes described in the section above entitled How we use your personal information, and disclosed to the categories of third parties described in the section above entitled How we share your personal information. We do not collect or process Sensitive Personal Information (as defined by California law) for the purpose of inferring characteristics about individuals.
