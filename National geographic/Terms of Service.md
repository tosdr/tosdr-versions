Any past, present or future access, use, copying, reproduction, extraction, distribution or exploitation of any of the works or content (or portion thereof) owned or controlled by National Geographic Society (including recordings, audiovisual recordings, composition, lyrics, artwork, images, data, metadata, etc.) for the purpose of text and data mining, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) training, development or commercialisation of AI systems, tools or technology, web scraping, mining, altering, making extractions, preparing derivative works or similar purposes, and by any means, is prohibited, except as specifically and expressly licensed by National Geographic Society in the form of a written licence.

National Geographic Society expressly reserves its rights in respect of the use of National Geographic Society’s content, including without limitation under Article 4 of the EU Directive 2019/790/EC to the fullest extent permitted (or not otherwise restricted) under such laws (in the event that a court decides this Article might apply to the above uses, an interpretation we should add we do not agree with). Our reservation applies to all content owned or controlled by National Geographic Society, now or in the future, including where this content may be identified through publicly available means.

### 4\. Liability

The Service is provided for informational purposes only. The Service should not be used in any high risk activities where damage or injury to persons, property, environment, finances or business may result if an error occurs. You expressly assume all risk for such use.

Although the Society does not routinely monitor the postings to the Service, the Society reserves the right (but assumes no obligation) to delete, move, or edit any Your Content that comes to its attention that Society considers in its sole discretion to be unacceptable or inappropriate, whether for legal or other reasons. Conduct by any user that, at the sole discretion of the Society, restricts or inhibits any other user from using or enjoying the Service will not be permitted. The Society reserves the right to refuse access to the Service to any user for any reason, including, without limitation, a reasonable belief that the user in question has violated these Terms, any other operating rules or terms currently posted on the Service, or any of the copyright or trademark laws of the United States.

The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other sites or resources. Because the Society has no control over such sites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that the Society is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that the Society shall not be responsible or liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused in connection with your use of or reliance on any such linked content, goods or services available on or through any such linked site or resource.

Your interactions with companies, organizations and/or individuals found on or through our Service, including any purchases, transactions, or other dealings, and any terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such companies, organizations and/or individuals. You agree that the Society will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. You also agree that, if there is a dispute between users of this Service, or between a user and any third party, the Society is under no obligation to become involved, and you agree to release the Society and its affiliates from any claims, demands and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such dispute and/or the Service.

The information, products and services offered on or through the site and any third-party sites are provided “as is” and without warranties of any kind either expressed or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, the Society disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

The Society neither warrants nor makes any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the site or materials on this site or on third-party sites in terms of their correctness, accuracy, timeliness, reliability or otherwise.

Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, will the Society, or our subsidiaries, parent, affiliates, service providers, and/or licensees or licensors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages that result from the use of, or the inability to use, this site, including its materials, products, or services, or third-party materials, products, or services made available through this site, even if we are advised beforehand of the possibility of such damages. (Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages, the above limitation may not apply to you. In such states, our liability and the liability of Society subsidiaries, parent companies, affiliates, service providers, and/or licensors is limited to the fullest extent permitted by such state law.) You specifically acknowledge and agree that the Society is not liable for any defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of any user. If you are dissatisfied with the site, or any materials, products, or services on the site, or with any of the site’s terms and conditions, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the site.

5. Refrain from posting any personal information of your own such as your email address, phone number, address, etc., and refrain from soliciting personal information from any user. However, if you do choose to post any personal information it means that you are making that information public and allowing everyone to use and access that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your user name and if applicable any profile photo);
6. Neither post nor transmit through the Service any Your Content that constitutes advertising or solicitation with respect to any product or service;
7. Not post anonymously or impersonate any other person;
