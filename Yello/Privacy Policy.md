We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.

* _Ad Tech Companies and Other Providers_ – We may share or make available limited Personal Information (such as a device identifiers) with ad tech companies and other online service providers. When we share your Personal Information in this context, we follow applicable legal requirements, which may require that we provide opt-out rights or other individual rights.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
---------------------------------------

We and our service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect usage and browser information about how you use our Site. The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include cookies and web beacons that permit us to verify system and server integrity and generate statistics around the popularity of certain content. We process the information collected through such technologies, which may include or be combined with Personal Information, to help operate certain features of our Site, to enhance your experience through personalization, and to help us better understand the features of our Site that you and other users are most interested in.

### Site Delivery and Appearance

We may use third party providers to enable certain customer interaction opportunities, content delivery (like audio or video), or other service capabilities. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following functionality:

* **Content Delivery:** We partner with service providers to host our Site and deliver specific content in support of our Services. For example, we use Adobe Typekit to serve fonts on our Site, which is governed by [Adobe Typekit’s Privacy Policy](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policies/adobe-fonts.html). We also partner with companies like YouTube to deliver specific content delivery like audio and video. For more information about how YouTube collects and uses your data, visit [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

* **Customer Interaction:** We enhance our customer interactions by offering features like Google Maps to locate our Service locations, payment processors to facilitate online payments. Each of these offerings are governed by the terms, conditions, and policies of the underlying service provider. For example, please see [Google Maps/Google Earth Terms of Service](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps/) and [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information on how that feature operates.

### Website Analytics and Session Replay

We use analytics and session replay services, that use cookies and other technologies that collect your Personal Information, to assist us with analyzing our Site traffic and site usage to optimize, maintain, and secure our Site and inform subsequent business decisions (including, e.g., advertising). These include, but are not limited to, the following third-party services:

* **Microsoft Clarity:** We partner with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising to capture how you use and interact with our Site through behavioral metrics, heatmaps, and session replay to improve and market our products/services. Site usage data is captured using first and third-party cookies and other tracking technologies to determine the popularity of products/services and online activity. Additionally, we use this information for site optimization, fraud/security purposes, and advertising. For more information about how Microsoft collects and uses your data, visit the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement).

* **Google Analytics**: To learn more about how Google uses data, visit [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy) and Google’s page on “[How Google uses data from sites or apps that use our services](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners).” You may download the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) for each web browser you use, but this does not prevent the use of other analytics tools. To learn more about Google Analytics cookies, visit [Google Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage).

### Interest-Based Advertising

We may also allow or enable third parties to collect Personal Information to provide their interest-based advertising on behalf of our products and Services, or their own. Interest-based advertising occurs when advertisements are shown to you based on information collected from your online interactions over time and across multiple websites, devices, or online services that you visit or use. Some companies may engage in cross-context behavioral advertising to predict your preferences and show you advertisements that are most likely to be of interest or relevant to you. We do not control these third parties’ collection or use of your information for these purposes, or the opt-out options they may individually offer you via their terms, conditions, and privacy policies. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. Examples of the third-party service providers we engage to serve interest-based advertisements include Google Ads (including Google Dynamic Remarketing and DoubleClick), Meta Ads (including Meta Pixels and Facebook advertising services), TikTok (including the TikTok Pixel), LinkedIn marketing solutions (including LinkedIn Ads and Analytics), X Advertising, Microsoft advertising, and Adobe.

### Selling or Sharing Personal Information

While we do not sell Personal Information in exchange for monetary consideration, we do share Personal Information for other benefits that could be deemed a “sale” or “sharing” under various data protection laws, because they are sometimes broadly defined to include activities such as the delivery of interest-based advertising on websites or allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies, IP address, and/or browsing behavior. We similarly engage in interest-based advertising when we use data about your activities on our Site to serve you ads on websites owned or controlled by third parties. It is in this context that we have provided advertising networks, data analytics providers, social networks, and video sharing platforms with Personal Information such as your IP address, device information, Internet and other electronic network activity information, and geolocation information in the last twelve months.

### Product-Based Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

We may also deploy variations of the cookies and related tracking technologies discussed in this _Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_ section within our products and Services, including any mobile applications and widgets. For your convenience, a table of those product-based cookies is included below for reference.

### Cookie Choices

To manage your preferences with respect to these technologies, you can:

* Visit our preferences page or customize your browser settings to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable certain cookies, please note that some parts of our Site may not function properly. These settings may be lost and require reconfiguration if you delete your cookies.

To opt out of advertising under Adobe, please follow [Adobe’s Experience Cloud opt-out instructions](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#customeruse). Meta also offers an [Ad Preferences center](https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053/?helpref=hc_fnav) to customize your settings, as well as a [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?section_id=6-HowCanYouManage) with additional information on how you can exercise your rights.

------------------------------------------

We retain your information for as long as needed: (i) to conduct business with you; (ii) fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy; and (iii) to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce any agreements.

Criteria we will use to determine how long to retain your Personal Information include the nature and length of our business relationship with you; our legal rights, obligations, and retention requirements; and if we have an ongoing business purpose for retaining your Personal Information, such as communicating with you about ongoing or prospective Services you requested.

### Links to Third-Party Websites

We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Site, including the information or content contained within them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing Personal Information to third parties, since any Personal Information disclosed will be handled in accordance with the applicable third party’s privacy policy.

In some cases, we offer links to social media platforms (like Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), LinkedIn, Reddit, Quora, and YouTube) that enable you to easily connect with us or share information on social media. Any content you post via these social media pages is subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies for those platforms.

We may also integrate with other websites to provide enhanced services, technological capabilities, or resources for you. These plug-in services and capabilities are governed by the terms, conditions, and policies of the underlying companies. Some of the integrations we currently offer include the ability to view our business and/or provider profiles on Google and Facebook, including the customer reviews publicly posted there. This hyperlinked content (including any embedded customer reviews) is governed according to the privacy policies for each platform, and the links to these external websites and services provided for your convenience.  We may also give you the option to login to Yello platforms via third-party services like Facebook or Google. If you choose to leverage this option to link your accounts, we will receive information associated with your account (such as your name and profile information) from that third-party service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service. We recommend reviewing the service’s privacy policy beforehand and managing your privacy settings on an ongoing basis.

International Use and Cross-Border Data Transfers
-------------------------------------------------

If you are visiting our Site from outside of the United States, please note that our Site is hosted in the United States. Where permitted by applicable law, we may transfer the personal data we collect about you to the United States and other jurisdictions that may not be deemed to provide the same level of data protection as your home country, as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy.

_For individuals in the European Union, European Economic Area, Switzerland, and United Kingdom:_ Yello will only transfer Personal Data to third parties located outside of this region when it has ensured appropriate safeguards for such Personal Information through use of the standard contractual clauses or other lawful and approved methods. To request a copy of applicable cross-border data transfer agreements, please reach out using the information in the _Contact Us_ section**.**

How We Protect Personal Information
-----------------------------------

We have implemented commercially reasonable measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. despite these efforts to store Personal Information in a secure environment, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information during its transmission or its storage on our systems. For example, Customers and Candidates are solely responsible for the security of their account credentials (e.g., passwords) and exercising caution when posting or sharing information in public areas of the Site or elsewhere.

### Exercising Your Privacy Rights

Depending on where you live, you may have the following rights with respect to your Personal Information under applicable data protection laws:

* _Access –_ The right to request access to and obtain a copy of any Personal Information we may have about you.

* _Deletion –_ The right to delete your Personal Information that we have collected or obtained, subject to certain exceptions.

* _Correction –_ The right to request that we correct any inaccuracies in your Personal Information, subject to certain exceptions.

* _Opt Out of Certain Processing –_ The right to: (a) opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for purposes of targeted advertising, (b) opt out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information; (c) limit the use of your sensitive Personal Information (if applicable), and (c) opt out of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. We do not collect or process sensitive Personal Information outside of purposes permitted by law (such as section 7027(m) under the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations), so we do not offer the option to limit its use. We also do not profile you or other individuals in a manner that would result in legal or similarly significant effects, so we do not offer an opt out.

* _Objection/Restriction of Processing_ – The right to object or restrict us from processing your Personal Information in certain circumstances.

* _Withdraw Consent_ – The right to withdraw your consent where we are relying on your consent to process your Personal Information.

* _Automated Decision-Making_ – The right to know when you are subject to automated decision-making, the Personal Information used to render the decision, the principal factors and parameters involved in the decision, and human review or correction of the decision (or its underlying data, where appropriate). You may also have the right to consent or opt out of this automated decision-making, depending on your location.

* _Lodge a Complaint ­_– The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority or other regulatory agency if you believe we have violated any of the rights afforded to you under applicable data protection laws. We encourage you to first reach out to us, so we have an opportunity to address your concerns directly before you do so.

To exercise any of the privacy rights afforded to you under applicable data protection laws, e-mail us at [privacy@yello.co](mailto:privacy@yello.co) or [privacy@wayup.com](mailto:privacy@wayup.com) (for Yello Sourcing or WayUp-related inquiries) or submit a request through our web form [here](https://learn.yello.co/Privacy-Policy-Opt-Out-2023_LP---Privacy-Policy-Opt-Out.html). You may also exercise your opt out rights by broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC). We honor Opt-Out Preference Signals, including GPC. If you choose to use an Opt-Out Preference Signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use.

You will not be discriminated against in any way by virtue of your exercise of the rights listed in this Notice. However, should you withdraw your consent or object to processing of your Personal Information, or if you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, we may be unable to provide some, or all, of our Services to you.

Only you, or an authorized agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your Personal Information. We must verify your identity before fulfilling your requests, and if we cannot verify your identity, we may request additional information from you. If you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of another person, we will also need to verify your identity, which may require proof of your written authorization or evidence of a power of attorney. We endeavor to respond to requests within the time period required by applicable law. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your requests unless they are excessive or repetitive. If we determine that a request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. We may deny certain requests, or only fulfill some in part, as permitted or required by law. If you are not satisfied with the resolution of your request and you are afforded a right to appeal such decision, you will be notified of our appeal process in our response to your request.

Note: Simply deleting our application from your mobile device will not initiate any of the above rights or terminate your account or Services. Your Services registration and account can only be terminated by following the procedures described in the corresponding Terms and Conditions. To execute your privacy rights, please follow the procedures described above.

### Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect or solicit any Personal Information from children, as defined under applicable law, without verified written parental consent, and we have no actual knowledge of selling such Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child, we will promptly take steps to delete that information.

For example, we may collect health information to make reasonable disability accommodations; immigration information to verify your right to work in a particular jurisdiction; and data points like your race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation to monitor equal opportunities. Please refrain from sending us any Special Category Data outside this employment context.
