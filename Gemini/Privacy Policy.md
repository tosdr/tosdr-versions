You agree that you will, within 15 days of receiving our Written Notice request, provide us with copies of the forms and formats of any Subscriber Agreements, as applicable, pursuant to which you have granted to Subscribers or any other Person the right to receive Gemini Market Data.

You agree and understand that we may, upon 10 days prior Written Notice and not more than twice during any 12 month period, audit you through a professional independent third-party auditor in order to confirm your compliance with the terms set forth in this Market Data Agreement. Such audit shall be conducted during normal business hours, during which time you agree that you will reasonably cooperate with such audit, and make available Persons and all books and records that are reasonably required to verify your compliance with the terms and conditions, including with respect to your fee obligations, set forth herein. Such audits will be at our sole cost and expense, provided that, notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if any such audit identifies any breach of this Market Data Agreement by you, you agree and understand that you will reimburse us for all expenses, fees, and costs associated with such audit, and you agree that we will be permitted to conduct additional audits (including within the same 12 month period), in accordance with the terms hereof, to confirm that any such breach has been cured.
