Such audit shall be conducted during normal business hours, during which time you agree that you will reasonably cooperate with such audit, and make available Persons and all books and records that are reasonably required to verify your compliance with the terms and conditions, including with respect to your fee obligations, set forth herein. Such audits will be at our sole cost and expense, provided that, notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if any such audit identifies any breach of this Market Data Agreement by you, you agree and understand that you will reimburse us for all expenses, fees, and costs associated with such audit, and you agree that we will be permitted to conduct additional audits (including within the same 12 month period), in accordance with the terms hereof, to confirm that any such breach has been cured.
