#### Using our Custody Services

By using our custody services, you represent and affirm that you are at least 18 years old, have the legal capacity to enter into this Custody Agreement, and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of this Custody Agreement in their entirety.

You agree and understand that this Custody Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in our User Agreement, which also govern this Custody Agreement. In case of conflict, the User Agreement shall control. You further agree and understand that the defined terms used in this Custody Agreement, if defined in our User Agreement, shall have the meanings set forth in our User Agreement.

You agree and understand that by using our custody services following any change to this Custody Agreement, your use of our custody services shall constitute your agreement to the amended Custody Agreement, and you agree to be legally bound by its terms and conditions as amended. You should, therefore, read this Custody Agreement from time to time. You further agree and understand that we have the right to require your affirmative assent and continuing acceptance of this Custody Agreement, from time to time, as a condition of using our custody services. If you do not agree to be bound by this Custody Agreement, you should not use our custody services.

#### Definitions

You agree and understand that the defined terms used in this Custody Agreement, if not defined in our User Agreement, shall have the meanings set forth below:

“Assets” means any Supported Digital Assets (which, for the purpose of this Custody Agreement, also includes Supported Cryptoassets) that have been Delivered to us to be held in a Custody Account established by us on your behalf, in each case until such Assets are withdrawn or cease to be Assets pursuant to this Custody Agreement. Assets shall also mean any Digital resulting from Forks that we, in our sole discretion, deem to be a Supported Digital Asset.

“Asset Balance” means the quantity of each Asset denominated in the appropriate Supported Digital Asset type.

“Authorized Person” is any person designated by you to have access to your Custody Account based on the role-based permissions you assign.

“Blockchain Address” means a public address on a blockchain in which Assets can be held (including, but not limited to, a Bitcoin address for the Asset commonly known as bitcoin and an Ethereum address for the Asset commonly known as ether).

“Cold Storage System” means our proprietary [offline storage system](https://gemini.com/security) that we use to custody your Assets.

“Custody Interface” means the interface of the Gemini platform located at exchange.gemini.com that allows for Custody Account actions including, but not limited to, the ability to view balances and request and approve withdrawals.

“Custody-Only Assets” means Assets for which we only provide custody services and do not list for trading on our exchange.

“Cut-Off Time” means 4pm Eastern Time each Business Day.

“Delivery” (or “Deliver,” Delivering,” or “Delivered,”) means the transfer of Supported Digital Assets to one or more Blockchain Addresses controlled by the receiving Party and provided by the receiving Party to the sending Party for such transfer. Supported Digital Assets will only be considered Delivered to us after the required number of network confirmations, as determined by us in our sole discretion, have occurred on the blockchain for such Supported Digital Assets.

“Effective Date” means the date of Delivery of Supported Digital Assets from you to us.

“General Instructions” means any notice, instruction, or other communication that is not Proper Instructions. We may rely upon any General Instruction that we believe in good faith has been given by an Authorized Person.

“Other Functionality” means functionality that may be associated with certain Assets including, but not limited to, staking, protocol governance, smart contract functionality, and other similar uses.

“Parties” (each, individually a “Party”) means you or us.

"Proper Instructions" means instructions that have been entered and confirmed via our Custody Interface.

"Withdrawal Request" means a request sent to us via Proper Instructions that specifies the type and amount of Assets to be withdrawn from your Custody Account and the destination Blockchain Address.

#### Custodian Appointment

You agree to hereby appoint us to act as the custodian of Assets to be held in your Depository Account and Custody Account in accordance with this Custody Agreement, and we accept such appointment and the obligations, duties, and responsibilities set out in this Custody Agreement. By entering into this Custody Agreement, you agree that you intend to create a bailment of Assets with us, and you agree that you intend that we be the bailee.

#### Depository Account

Please refer to the User Agreement for details on how we hold Assets in your Depository Account under custody.

#### Custody Account

You agree and understand that we will establish a Custody Account in your name. Your Custody Account will have one or more associated unique Blockchain Addresses in which your Assets will be (i) segregated from any and all other assets held by us and (ii) directly verifiable via the applicable blockchain. We will provide you with all Blockchain Addresses associated with your Custody Account.

The ownership of your Assets will be clearly recorded in our books as belonging to you. Our records will at all times provide for the separate identification of your Assets. We will not loan, hypothecate, pledge, or otherwise encumber any Assets in your Custody Account, absent General Instructions from you.

You agree and understand that nothing herein prevents us from using our Cold Storage System to custody our own property and/or the property of third parties; provided, however, that, at a minimum, separate Blockchain Addresses are utilized to segregate your Assets from such other property.

##### Delivery

You agree and understand that Supported Digital Assets will only be considered Assets after they have been Delivered to a Blockchain Address provided by us to you. You agree and understand that we have no obligation with respect to any Supported Digital Assets unless such Supported Digital Assets have been so Delivered to us. In addition, you agree and understand that we are not required to accept Delivery of any Supported Digital Assets, and have no liability therefor (except, if Delivered by you, to ensure return by Delivery of such Supported Digital Assets to you), if we believe that the acceptance thereof would or is reasonably likely to expose us or any of our affiliates to any liability (contingent or otherwise).

##### Deposits

Deposits of Supported Digital Assets to a Blockchain Address of your Custody Account may occur without our involvement. Deposits will be credited to your Custody Account once they are Delivered.

##### Withdrawals

Upon submission of a Withdrawal Request via our Custody Interface, all Authorized Persons will receive an email notification informing them of the Withdrawal Request. An Authorized Person (other than the Authorized Person who initiated the Withdrawal Request) must then approve the Withdrawal Request via our Custody Interface (a “Withdrawal Confirmation”).

If only one Authorized Person is designated on a Gemini Account, a Withdrawal Request will be approved following a new or recently successful multi-factor authentication.

Once a Withdrawal Confirmation has been made, your Withdrawal Request will be processed within one Business Day of the next Cut-Off-Time.

You agree and understand that with respect to Proper Instructions, we cannot authenticate whether or not such Proper Instructions originated from an Authorized Person.

You agree and understand that we have the right to refuse to execute any Withdrawal Request that we believe may be in violation of any Applicable Laws and Regulations.

You agree and understand that we may rely upon any action that we believe in good faith to have been taken by an Authorized Person.

##### Fees

You agree and understand that we deduct a fee denominated in the respective Asset type (the “Custody Fee”) from the Assets held by us on your behalf. The Custody Fee is: (i) calculated on a daily basis at 4pm Eastern Time; and (ii) accrues each calendar day against your respective Asset Balance beginning on the day the Supported Digital Assets were Delivered to us (i.e., becoming Assets). You also agree and understand that we will invoice you for the Custody Fee on a recurring basis, and amounts due will be paid to Gemini in United States Dollars, provided, in our sole discretion, we may instead deduct the Custody Fee from the Assets we hold on your behalf on a monthly basis, on or around the last Business Day of every calendar month, or more frequently. If your Custody Fee payment in fiat currency results is rejected for any reasons (non-sufficient funds, closed accounts, etc.) you will be billed for the costs and fees incurred by Gemini in collecting such amounts (for example, any NSF fee or similar charge from your bank). We may also bill in kind for late payment fees and interest as set forth in the fee schedule. If we do not have your bank account information available to bill you via fiat currency, we will continue to bill you in kind for your Custody Fee. You further agree and understand that we will deduct the accrued and uncollected Custody Fee from the Assets we hold on your behalf any time your Asset Balance falls below the accrued but uncollected Custody Fee, including when you withdraw your Assets. The Custody Fee amount, and frequency of deductions, may be amended, modified or changed from time to time, in our sole discretion.

You agree and understand that we may deduct an administrative withdrawal fee (the “Administrative Withdrawal Fee”) in connection with a Withdrawal Request and in accordance with our Custody Fee Schedule.

The Custody Fee Schedule is incorporated by reference and is made available here:

[https://gemini.com/fees/custody-fee-schedule](https://gemini.com/fees/custody-fee-schedule)

##### Statements

We will provide you with an itemized account statement (“Custody Statement”) monthly via our Custody Interface, which will list the accrued Daily Fees for your Assets.

##### Suspension or Termination

You agree and understand that we have the right to suspend and/or terminate our custody services under this Custody Agreement pursuant to the Account Suspension and Account Termination provisions of the User Agreement.
