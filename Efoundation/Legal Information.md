e Foundation Policy
-------------------

#### About this Website  

The source code of the website can be found in [https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress). It is licensed under the GPL v2 license.

We use [Slimstat](https://www.wp-slimstat.com/) to create visitors statistics for our internal use. We use these statistics internally, for example, to measure how our website performs or which news site people come from. These statistics are not providing us any personal identifiable information. This information isn’t disclosed to third parties unless legally obliged to do so.

We use cookies to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Chrome, Safari or Firefox) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies settings. If you disable cookies, some minor features might be disabled.

We honour the do-not-track directive. If enabled, https//e.foundation won’t create any statistics or cookie per your visit.

Please note that e.foundation/blog aggregates content from media, blogs and other sources and we cannot be held responsible for their opinions or content.

#### Do we collect any personal information on e.foundation?

We collect information from you when you subscribe to a newsletter, fill out a form, make a donation, interact with us by email, submit a job or an internship application, or enter information on our site.

When you register to receive our newsletter by email, you will get general news about the project including information about new products and services. You may unsubscribe from any of these communications.

We implement a variety of security measures when you place an order and enter, submit, or access your information to maintain the safety of your personal information.

#### What about the information I submit when I donate?

As a non-profit, we rely on donations and e.foundation allows you to make a donation. Those transactions are processed by third parties, and not e.foundation. e.foundation does not receive any financial information, which is transmitted from you to our third party vendors for processing. The name of the third party will be displayed at the time of the transaction.

We use PayPal and Patreon to process donations to the e Foundation.

#### How do we protect personal data on our servers?

Your personal information is contained behind secured networks at our partners and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

/e/OS Privacy Policy
--------------------

#### Applications

We don’t collect or keep any information about which Android or Progressive Web Applications you install and run on /e/OS, or what you do within those apps (app metadata). Our search engine Spot is a [metasearch engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine). It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data. All your requests are anonymized. There is no systematic mining of the data sent to you other than to provide you with search results. There is no manual processing or transfer to any third party. IP addresses are logged for the minimum legal duration. We can not take any responsibility for third-party apps and the data they store or obtain about users. We do have a policy in our app store against abusing private data and any app that is found to be in violation is removed and its author banned. However, we do not have the ability to check all code of all third-party applications and thus we recommend you are careful when installing third-party apps. If you see any problems, please report it to abuse@e.mail

#### Location

In /e/OS, we don’t collect or keep any information about your GPS location. To be able to locate you when you use the onboard maps application or other services requiring your location, we do so by leveraging the Mozilla Location Services API, a set of software tools developed by Mozilla Corporation.

Here is what that means for your data

* This means that Mozilla receives your approximate location when you ask us to locate you. Mozilla will receive your location each time you choose to share your location with another application or website.
* Mozilla receives publicly observable data about WiFi access points, Bluetooth beacons and cell towers around you, your estimated latitude and longitude, the date and information about your heading, speed and altitude. This information is stored locally on your device until an Internet connection is established. The data is then deleted from your device and sent to Mozilla.
* If you do not want to report crowd-sourced data to Mozilla, you can set your location services to ‘off’ or ‘device only’. These settings can be accessed from your OS, going into ‘Settings’, then tap ‘Location’. To turn off location services, tap the switch in the top right corner and then  ‘Mode’. To select ‘device only, within the ‘location’ settings page, tap on ‘mode’ and select ‘Device only.
* In addition, Mozilla may receive certain temporary data such as your IP address. This data is deleted after being used as follows:
* for security purposes to protect against certain types of attack.
* to assist in providing you with an approximate location.

#### Over the Air Updates

When you connect to our servers to update /e/OS, we collect some visitors statistics such as your IP address, only for our internal use. We use these statistics internally, for example, to know which country users come from or which smartphones variants are being updated. These statistics are not providing us any personal identifiable information. This information is not disclosed unless legally obliged to do so. All data on your “own” /e/ server is encrypted and never shared, sold or traded to any third party. We will only disclose the limited user data we possess unless legally obliged to do so. Power users or users concerned about their personal data being in remote servers can choose to self-host.

murena.io and @e.email policy
-----------------------------

Our software does not send any of your user personal data to us.

We use [NextCloud](http://www.nextcloud.com/), [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/), and [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) to provide our cloud services.

The following default apps mail/drive/gallery/calendar/files/tasks are linked to your e.email account and communicate seamlessly with your “own” /e/ server (through our partner Nextcloud). While these apps handle your personal mail, calendar and files, they do not send any personal data to us.

All data on your “own” /e/ server is encrypted and never shared, sold or traded to any third party. We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if legally obliged to do so.
