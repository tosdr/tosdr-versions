Our Services use cookies to function effectively.  A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. 

We may obtain certain information through our Services by automated means, such as cookies (including HTTP, HTML5 and Flash cookies), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your use of our Services (collectively “cookies”).  Some cookies are essential to offer our Services, such as authentication services when you sign up or log in to use our Services.

The information we obtain through cookies may include IP address, mobile device advertising ID, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, logs on actions taken on our Services such as content on which you may click while using the Services, and dates and times you access or use the Services.  In connection with our mobile apps, we may use similar automated means and also may obtain your phone number and details about your mobile carrier. 

The information we obtain through cookies will tell us, for example, if you have used our Services before, from what country and what contents you have visited. It will also tell us whether you have opened an email we sent to you, what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may have seen on our Services or on third-party websites and apps.

Our Services may use third party analytics and advertising cookies, for example, to help create reports and statistics on the performance of the Services and to be able to present you with content tailored to your interests.  The information collected through the use of analytics may include, for example, your IP address, the website from which you visited us, the type of device you used.  You can opt out from the use of Google Analytics by downloading and installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add On](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) 

We and our third-party service providers may use information collected through automated means including cookies, web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies for purposes such as (1) customizing our users’ visits to and use of our Services, (2) delivering content (including advertising) tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users use our Services, and (3) managing our Services and other aspects of our business. 

In addition, if you register with us through or connect your account with us to a third-party social media network (such as Facebook or Twitter), we may obtain certain information about you from the relevant social media network, such as your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media network, the information contained in your public profile on the social media network and friends lists.  The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social media network. 

The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Services, such as social media sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features.  This information is collected directly by the providers of those features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers.

9\. HARPERCOLLINS AND GDPR
--------------------------

**GDPR and HarperCollins**

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) will replace the current DPA (Data Protection Act) from 25th May 2018. The main aim of the regulation is to give citizens greater control over what can be done with their personal data by businesses, and HarperCollins is committed to the protection of the data of our authors, vendors, and consumers.

**Our GDPR process**

We have completed a full audit of all our existing applications, websites, information systems and data processing activities. We have mapped out how and where we collect sensitive and personal data and confirmed our legal basis to hold onto it.

We worked with our vendors to ensure all data that we have a legal basis to hold is managed and processed in a way that is GDPR compliant. We have updated our policies and the language we are using for consent when we collect personal and sensitive information to meet the requirements of GDPR.

Finally, we have set up future workflows to ensure we are addressing privacy by design in the planning of any new projects. We are building the appropriate back-end systems to ensure we are compliant with our information security obligations and are equipped to effectively deal with data subject requests.

We broke down our initiatives into eight different focus areas as mapped out below:

**Policies:** We reviewed centrally located legal policies and guidelines and customised them where necessary. We made policies and guidelines accessible to staff and external customers. This includes incidence response and our Information Security policies and processes.

**Applications:** We identified enterprise applications that hold sensitive and personal data, investigated and implemented security measures, and identified and reviewed retention periods and policies.

**Websites:** We identified websites that collect personal data, and updated consent documentation to ensure that it is GDPR compliant. We also standardised collection mechanisms for future website publications.

**Vendors:** We identified vendors that store and/or process personal data and established additional security measures as necessary. We reviewed agreements and are in the process of inserting model clauses and updating contracts where appropriate.

**Legal Basis:** We determined our measurement of legal basis to hold onto current data that we have a legitimate business reason to keep and discarded where no legal basis existed.

**Privacy by Design**: We developed a standardised process where all new products and projects will have a Data Impact Privacy Assessment conducted at the start. We have targeted staff who deal with personal data for training and prepared an ongoing training programme and onboarding procedure.

**Data Subject Access Requests:** We determined and implemented processes and documentation for

Access, Restrict Processing

Rectification, Data Portability

Erasure, Objections and Breach Escalation Process

**Communications and Training:** We worked with a core project team as well as business owners across all areas of HarperCollins to establish a general business awareness of GDPR and detailed expectations of the staff. We have regular meetings and communications pieces and will continue engagement up to, and beyond, May 2018.

**Additional technical and organisational security measures we have in place to protect personal data**

Access to our systems is granted on a need to basis; regular backups are taken and data is transmitted securely using HTTPS protocol.  Systems are protected with anti-malware and patched regularly. Firewall and SIEM tools are in place to detect and prevent intrusion. Staff are also provided with regular cyber security and awareness training. 

10\. HOW WE PROTECT AND RETAIN PERSONAL DATA
--------------------------------------------

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Data we have about you against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.  We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of Personal Data.

We retain Personal Data for the period needed to fulfill the purposes for which Personal Data was collected and as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law, such as in relation to our record retention obligations.

11\. DATA TRANSFERS
-------------------

The Services may be hosted in and managed from a country outside the country in which you initially provided the information, including the United States.  When your Personal Data is transferred to (or accessed from) a country outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, we will implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that your Personal Data remains protected.  This may include data transfer agreements, a copy of which you can obtain by contacting us as indicated in the [How To Contact Us](https://corporate.harpercollins.co.uk/customer-service) Section below.

However, your Personal Data may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities of the recipient country in accordance with applicable law.  When we transfer your Personal Data, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice.

12\. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES, APPS AND SERVICES
--------------------------------------------------

For your convenience and information, our Services may provide links to third-party sites, apps and services that may be operated by companies not affiliated with HarperCollins Publishers Limited.  These companies may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any non- HarperCollins  sites, apps or services.

13\. UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY NOTICE
----------------------------------

This Privacy Notice may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our Personal Data practices.  For significant changes, we will notify you by posting a prominent notice on our Services indicating at the top of the Notice when it was most recently updated. 

14\. HOW TO CONTACT US
----------------------

The entity responsible for the collection and processing of Personal Data in connection with the Services is the Company HarperCollins Publishers Limited registered in Scotland under company number 27389 and whose registered offices are located at Westerhill Road, Bishopsbriggs, Glasgow, G64 2QT.
