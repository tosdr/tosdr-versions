LANSCHOOL AIR “AS-IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF

PARTICULAR PURPOSE; UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION WITHOUT ERROR; FREE OF

STONEWARE AND ITS AFFILIATES, ITS EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS, DEALERS OR

NEW WARRANTIES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF

IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT

EVENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM

PERMITTED BY YOUR JURISDICTION OR, IN THE ABSENCE OF A LEGAL MINIMUM,

NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF LANSCHOOL AIR OR MINIMUM

OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES THAT

APPLY TO STONEWARE PRODUCTS.



By using LanSchool Air, you agree that, to the extent permitted by law, we will have no liability

for any special, indirect, or consequential damages that you may sustain from your use of

LanSchool Air, whether due to loss of data or profits, negligence, breach of contract, or

otherwise. The total aggregate liability of Stoneware, its affiliates and suppliers shall be limited

to the amounts paid or payable by you to Stoneware for use of LanSchool Air under this

Agreement in the six (6) month period prior to the date when the cause of action arose. This

limitation applies under contract, tort, strict liability, or any other legal theory.



To the extent permitted by law, you assume all risks concerning the suitability and accuracy of

the information that you send or receive using LanSchool Air. LanSchool Air may contain

technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. We assume no responsibility for any such

inaccuracies, errors, or omissions associated with LanSchool Air.

(“High Risk Activities”). You agree that we will not be responsible for any injury, environmental

damage, or property damage arising out of your use of LanSchool Air in High Risk Activities.



Stoneware will not be responsible for the actions of any individual or any accident that results

while using or attempting to use LanSchool Air. FAILURE OF LANSCHOOL AIR DOES NOT

CONSTITUTE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD STONEWARE OR ITS AFFILIATES LIABLE

CONSEQUENCES OF USING LANSCHOOL AIR.

8. Indemnity. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Stoneware and its affiliates,

officers, agents, co-branders, partners, and employees from any third party claim or demand

(including but not limited to damages, litigation costs, and reasonable attorney's fees) that

relates to your use of LanSchool Air or your violation of this Agreement. We reserve the right to

year thereafter, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. We

in good faith concern that such use a) violates an applicable law or these Terms of Service; or

b) may subject Stoneware and its affiliates to liability; and (2) inform law enforcement of any

illegal activity or material relating to use of LanSchool Air and provide law enforcement officials

with all requested information we may have, including but not limited to the name, phone

number, and email addresses of any user account suspected of illegal activity. Any terms of this

Agreement, which by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement,

including but not limited to Limitations on Liability and Indemnity, shall survive the expiration or

10. Trademarks. STONEWARE is a registered trademark of Stoneware, Inc. All other product

or service names are the property of their respective owners. You may not alter, obscure, or

render unclear any trademark, logo, or other notice that indicates the rights of Stoneware or our

licensors and suppliers, whether built into LanSchool Air, printed on packaging or promotional

material, published online, or otherwise.



11. On-task Monitoring Artificial Intelligence.



If your use of LanSchool Air includes the On-task Monitoring feature, the following terms of this

Section 11 apply.



LanSchool Air On-task Monitoring may provide features using artificial intelligence (“AI”)

technology which may leverage large language models developed by Stoneware, Lenovo or

others (“AI Services”). For example, this may include you adding content input in a dialog box

with a chatbot, or authorize a software application (embedded with large language models) to

access and process your files, images, or other information (collectively referred to as "inputs"),

and content will be generated based on the inputs, such as text output, tables, codes, pictures

and other contents (collectively referred to as "outputs"). Inputs and outputs are collectively

referred to as "Your Content".



You should be aware that:



• You should not rely on factual assertions in outputs without independently fact-checking

their accuracy. Outputs that appear accurate because of their detail or specificity may

still contain material inaccuracies; and

Page 7 of 8

LanSchool Air Terms of Service v011 08.2024



• AI Services cannot dynamically retrieve information, and outputs may not account for

events or changes to underlying facts occurring after the AI model was trained.



The content generated with AI Services is for your reference only. You need to review the

generated content and judge its value by yourself. We will not be responsible for any damage or

other consequences caused by your use of AI Services, the content generated, or your

decisions or actions made by referring to or relying on the content generated. Unless expressly

required by law, AI Services content generation will be in English.



You must strictly abide by relevant sections under the “Prohibited Uses” terms of this

Agreement regarding your use of the AI Services.



In addition to complying with the “Prohibited Uses” terms of this Agreement, in connection with

your use of AI Services and your sharing of the AI generated content or other information

through LanSchool Air, you promise not to take any of the following actions:



• Generate content or share information that may infringe others’ rights, such as:



o Submit any input that includes trademarks or other materials protected by third-

party intellectual property rights, unless you have sufficient rights in such

materials.

o Submit any input that is intended to generate output that is substantially like a

third party’s copyrighted work or is otherwise protected by third-party intellectual

property rights, unless you have sufficient rights in such work.

o Submit any input that contains personal data unless you comply with all data

protection and privacy laws and regulations applicable to the personal data in

accordance with Section 5, Privacy and Security, of these Terms of Service.



Although we have taken corresponding compliance measures, due to the limitations of artificial

intelligence and other relevant technologies, Stoneware cannot guarantee the authenticity and

legality of all content generated with AI Services. Before you publish or disseminate content

generated with AI Services, you should: (1) verify the authenticity and accuracy of the output

content and avoid spreading false information; (2) mark in a conspicuous manner that the output

content is generated by artificial intelligence to inform the public; (3) avoid publishing and

disseminating any output content that may violate applicable laws or these policies.



Given that the content generated by LanSchool’s On-task Monitoring features may rely on

machine-trained artificial intelligence models, the content generated from input of different users

in different scenarios may have similarities and differences; that is, the generated content may

be the same, similar, or partially or completely different. You understand and agree that if your

output is the same or like the output of other users, you and the other users will each use the

corresponding output based on their input, and you should not regard the output of other users

as your output.



To ensure users’ compliance with these acceptable use policies, you acknowledge and agree

that 1) we may use automated systems and humans to review your use of LanSchool Air On-

Task Monitoring including but not limited to activities associated with your account, Your

Content and other information you shared; and 2) take measures such as blocking activities,

content or information that, based on our reasonable belief, may violate relevant laws,

regulations and our policies. Please do not take actions, generating content or sharing

information that you do not want us to review. You must not maliciously obstruct LanSchool On-

Task Monitoring content filtering or other review mechanisms by using meaningless garbled

Page 8 of 8

LanSchool Air Terms of Service v011 08.2024



characters, numbers, variations, homonyms, complex semantics or long text. Notwithstanding

the above, you are solely responsible for any claim or liability in connection with your use of

LanSchool Air On-Task Monitoring and our review do not mean that we accept any liability.



12. Notices. We may be required by state, federal, or provincial law to notify you of certain

events. In addition, we may need to notify you from time to time regarding changes to this

Agreement or LanSchool Air. Such notices will be effective upon our posting them to our

website, your installation or use of any updates to LanSchool Air, or our delivery of a notice to

you by email, postal mail, or other means as required by law. If you do not provide us with

accurate information to contact you, we will not be held liable if we fail to notify you.



You consent to receiving any notices regarding the Agreement or any notice required by law,

including notice of a breach of security involving your personally identifiable information, through

an email message or other electronic communication.



Any notices that we send to you by email will be sent to the email address you provided when

you registered for an account or any email address in your profile.



13. General information. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements between you and

Stoneware relating to your use of LanSchool Air with respect to its Software as a Services

application. Any prior purchase you or your organization may have previously made of any other

Stoneware product, including, but not limited to any on-premises LanSchool product, in no way

includes or entitles you to use LanSchool Air.



By using LanSchool Air, you agree that the statutes and laws of the State of Indiana, without

regard to any principles of conflicts of law, will apply to all matters relating to your use of

LanSchool Air. You also agree that any litigation will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of

the state courts of Indiana. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. Our failure

to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement does not waive our right to

exercise or enforce our rights in the future. If any court finds a provision of these terms and

conditions to be invalid, then you agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the

intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of this Agreement will

remain in full force and effect.
