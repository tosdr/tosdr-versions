LanSchool Air Data Processor Agreement v009 March 2024



LanSchool Air Data Processor Agreement (DPA)



This LanSchool Air Data Processor Agreement (which addresses both privacy and security

requirements) and its annexes, (“DPA”) form part of the Stoneware Sales Agreement or other written

or electronic agreement between Stoneware, Inc., and Customer (the “Agreement”) for the purchase

of LanSchool Air services from Stoneware, Inc. to reflect the parties’ agreement in relation to the

Processing of Personal Data.



This DPA supplements any agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof;

and will be effective from the moment that Customer accepts LanSchool Air Terms of Services

("Effective Date").



Upon signature of the Agreement and acceptance of the LanSchool Air Terms of Services, this DPA will

become legally binding; and you (Customer) are entering into this DPA on behalf of Customer, to the

extent required under applicable privacy, security and data protection Laws and Regulations, including

applicable education and student privacy and security laws and regulations, in the name and on behalf

of its Authorized Affiliates to the extent Stoneware processes Personal Data for which such Authorized

Affiliates qualify as the Controller. Customer understands that this DPA is applicable to all users and

warrants that it has the necessary powers to enter into this DPA on behalf of such users.



We may update these terms to accommodate new legal requirements or as necessary to reflect

operational updates. If you have an active LanSchool Air subscription, we will let you know via email

or via in-product notification. You can find archived versions of the DPA here.



DPA execution:



a) This DPA consists of two parts: the main body of the DPA, and Annexes A, B, C, D and E

b) This DPA has been pre-signed on behalf of Stoneware, Inc., including the EU Standard

Contractual Clauses in Annex D, as the data importer. (Note: Annex D is generally applicable

to only processing activities that may involve the transfer of Personal Data from the European

Union, European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and/or other countries with similar

adequacy or equivalency standards pertaining to cross-border data transfers).



For the avoidance of doubt, you need to sign this DPA on page 5. If applicable, Annex D will apply by

reference.

Data Protection



Definitions: In this Clause, the following terms shall have the following meanings:



a) "Controller", "Processor", “Subprocessor”, “Data Processing”, and "Processing" (and

"Process") shall have the meanings given in EU Data Protection Law and equivalent terms in

Applicable Data Protection Law.



b) "Applicable Data Protection Law" means all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, and all

related amendments thereto, in any jurisdiction in which Supplier provides LanSchool

Services, including any laws concerning privacy, data security, data protection, data breaches,

and confidentiality such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and the

California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”); the European Union’s General Data Protection

Regulation 2016/279, as amended, replaced or superseded from time to time (“GDPR”); the

United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018 as amended; The Brazil Law No. 13.709/18 as

amended (“LGPD”) and the regulations implemented (or to be implemented); and any such

applicable laws, including national, state and/or local education and student privacy laws.



c) “Personal Data” is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual including,

but not limited to, students, parents, and school employees.



d) “Data Subject” is an individual person who can be identified directly or indirectly including,

but not limited to, students, parents, and school employees.



e) “Customer” is the Controller. For the purposes of this DPA only, the term “Customer” shall

include Customer and Authorized Affiliates.



f) “Supplier” means Stoneware, Inc., which acts as Processor.



g) "Data Exporter" means a party that transfers Personal Data (acting as a Controller) to another

Party in accordance with the Agreement.



h) "Data Importer" means a party that receives Customer Personal Data (acting as a Processor

or Subprocessor) from another Party (Controller) in accordance with this Agreement.



Relationship of the parties: The Controller acknowledges Supplier as a Processor to process the

Personal Data that is the subject of Stoneware Sales Agreement, LanSchool Air Terms of Services and

EULA with Supplier. Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Data

Protection Law.



Purpose limitation: Supplier shall process the Personal Data as a Processor and strictly in accordance

with the documented instructions of Controller (the "Permitted Purpose") as documented in Annex A

“Processing details,” except where otherwise required by any Applicable Data Protection Law.

Supplier shall immediately inform Controller if it becomes aware that Controller's Processing

instructions infringe Applicable Data Protection Law. In no event shall Supplier process the Personal

Data for its own purposes or those of any third-party, including for marketing purposes. For the

3

LanSchool Air Data Processor Agreement v009 March 2024



avoidance of doubt, Supplier shall not send marketing or otherwise promotional communications to

Lenovo LanSchool Air users leveraging personal data obtained from the use of Lenovo Lan School Air.

The latter will not prevent any individual from receiving marketing or promotional communications if

those originate in the context of standard channels such as Stoneware or Lenovo website and other

sales related channels.



International transfers: Supplier may transfer the Personal Data to any country outside of the country

from which Personal Data was collected in compliance with applicable Data Protection and data

localization laws. For the avoidance of doubt:



a) Personal Data transfers outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") and the United

Kingdom are allowed: (i) if the Personal Data transfer is to a recipient in a country that the

European Commission, United Kingdom Secretary of State, and/or the United Kingdom’s

Information Commissioner’s Office have decided provides adequate protection for Personal

Data; and (ii) to a recipient that has executed standard contractual clauses adopted or

approved by the European Commission, United Kingdom Secretary of State, and/or the United

Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office.



Supplier may transfer the Personal Data outside of Brazil if: (i) the Data transfer is to a

recipient in a country that the National Authority has decided provides adequate protection

for Personal Data; (ii) to a recipient that has executed standard contractual clauses adopted

or approved by the National Authority; or (iii) when the recipient is able to provide and

demonstrate the implementation other safeguards in accordance to the Brazilian Data

Protection Law and the international transfer is approved by the Controller.



b) Generally, the acceptance of this DPA results in approval by the Customer that Stoneware,

Inc. may transfer Personal Data across borders to the extent that Stoneware complies with

any applicable Data Protection Laws. In this regard, Annex D “International Data Transfers”

applies between Controller and Supplier where relevant.



Confidentiality of Processing: Supplier shall ensure that any person that it authorizes to process the

Personal Data (including Supplier’s staff, agents and subprocessor) (an "Authorized Person") shall be

subject to a strict duty of confidentiality (whether a contractual duty or a statutory duty) and shall not

permit any person to process the Personal Data who is not under such a duty of confidentiality.

Supplier shall ensure that all Authorized Persons process the Personal Data only as necessary for the

Permitted Purpose. Furthermore, Supplier shall not commercially exploit the Personal Data.



Security: The Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect

the Personal Data (i) from accidental or unlawful destruction, and (ii) loss, alteration, unauthorized

disclosure of, or access to the Personal Data (a "Security Incident"). Annex C contains LanSchool Air

Technical and Organizational Measures (TOMs).

4

LanSchool Air Data Processor Agreement v009 March 2024



Subprocessing: Supplier agrees that any third-party subprocessor it appoints shall be bound to the

same standard of data protection provided for by this Agreement; and that Supplier will enter into

agreements accordingly with its applicable subprocessors to give appropriate effect to the

requirements in this DPA Controller agrees that Supplier may use any subprocessor listed in Annex B.

Notwithstanding this, Controller consents to Supplier engaging new subprocessors (including the

replacement of existing ones) to process the Personal Data, provided that: (i) Supplier provides at

least 30 business days prior notice of the addition or replacement of any subprocessor (including

details of the processing it performs or will perform), which may be given by provided details of such

addition or replacement to Controller; and (ii) Supplier imposes data protection terms on any

subprocessor it appoints that protect the Personal Data to the same standard provided for by this

DPA. If Controller refuses to consent to Supplier's appointment of a new third-party subprocessor,

which should not be withheld unreasonably, then either Supplier will not appoint the subprocessor or

Controller may elect to terminate the Agreement, provided that the Controller has substantial and

documented reasons for objection to the change.



Cooperation and Data Subjects' rights: Supplier shall provide reasonable and timely assistance to

Controller to enable Controller to respond to: (i) any request from a Data Subject to exercise any of

its rights under Applicable Data Protection Law (including its rights of access, correction, objection,

erasure and Personal Data portability, as applicable); and (ii) any other correspondence, enquiry or

complaint received from a Data Subject, regulator or other third-party in connection with the

Processing of the Personal Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Data Subject Requests (DSRs) shall be

requested by Controller by submitting a formal request in the Stoneware DSR Privacy Webform.



Security incidents: Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Supplier shall inform Controller

without undue delay and shall provide all such timely information and cooperation as Controller may

require to fulfil its Personal Data breach reporting obligations under (and in accordance with the

timescales required by) Applicable Data Protection Law. Supplier shall further take measures and

actions as are necessary to remedy or mitigate the effects of the Security Incident and shall keep

Controller informed of all developments in connection with the Security Incident.



Deletion or return of Data: Upon termination or expiry of the Stoneware Sales Agreement, Supplier

shall, upon Controller’s request, destroy or return to Controller all Personal Data (including all copies

of the Personal Data) in its possession or control (including any Personal Data subcontracted to a third-

party for Processing). If Controller does not give further instructions to Supplier, Supplier ́s data

retention schedule, as laid out in Annex A, will apply. This requirement shall not apply to the extent

that Supplier is required by any applicable Data Protection Law to retain some or all of the Personal

Data, in which event Supplier shall isolate and protect the Personal Data from any further Processing

except to the extent required by such law.

5

LanSchool Air Data Processor Agreement v009 March 2024



Audit: During the term of this Agreement and for three years after termination or expiration, Supplier

shall permit Controller (or its third-party auditors) to audit Supplier's compliance at its own expense

and shall make available to Controller information necessary for Controller (or its third-party auditors)

to conduct such audit, provided that such audit request is reasonable in scope and that Controller

gives it reasonable prior notice of its intention to audit. Controller will not exercise its audit rights

more than once in any twelve (12) calendar month period, except if and when required by instruction

of a competent data protection authority.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Stoneware and Customer have executed this Agreement as of the date

written above.
