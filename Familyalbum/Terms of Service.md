Terms of Use for FamilyAlbum
============================

#### Update Notice (June 24, 2020)

The following text has been removed from Article 12 of our Terms of Use: "If the User never views or uses the electronic photo album which he/she created for a period of one year, the account related to the said electronic photo album (the account of the Admin User related to the electronic photo album and the account of the Browsing User) is likely to be deleted."  
In practice, FamilyAlbum has never deleted a user’s data unless asked to do so by the user. We also have no plans to do so in the future. This section has been removed accordingly.  
This means that we'll continue to maintain your account indefinitely until you ask us to delete it.  

1. \* These Terms of Use are translated into English for reference purposes. The original Japanese version of the [“Terms of Use for FamilyAlbum” (Kazoku Album Mitene Riyo Kiyaku)](https://family-album.com/ja/terms) is the only official and complete document prepared by MIXI, Inc. Therefore, these Terms of Use in English shall not be legally binding as the said “Terms of Use for FamilyAlbum” and shall not affect or be used as reference in the interpretation of the said Terms of Use. Please note that MIXI, Inc. does not guarantee and is not liable for the contents of these Terms of Use.
