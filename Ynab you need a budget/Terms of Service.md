We also use data relating to your bank account(s) held by third party financial institutions (“Open Banking”) to help us to provide you with automated and dynamic access to your spending activity. We will therefore request your permission, as part of the connection process, to access your bank account(s) data using Open Banking. We use third party providers such as [Plaid Inc. (“Plaid”)](https://plaid.com/), [MX Technologies, Inc. (“MX”)](https://www.mx.com/), the Apple FinanceKit framework[,](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/financekit) and TrueLayer Limited or TrueLayer (Ireland) Limited (collectively or individually, “[TrueLayer](https://truelayer.com/)”) for this purpose, and by using our services, you accept such third party provider’s terms of use and privacy policies and expressly grant such third party the right, power, and authority to access and transmit your information as reasonably necessary to provide the services to you. The third party provider we use varies based on the location of the third party financial institution at which you maintain the bank account(s) to which you provide us access. If you provide us access to your Apple Card account, we operate through the use of the Apple FinanceKit framework. To enable access to your Apple Card account information, you will need to grant us permission.

If your bank account is in the United States or Canada, Open Banking will be provided by Plaid or MX. You authorize us to access data from the applicable third party provider such as personal identity information and possibly other data such as transactional data and, if the third party provider is Plaid, by doing so you accept the [**Plaid End User Services Agreement**](https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-services-agreement-us) and [**Plaid Privacy Policy**](https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy). You can review [**Plaid’s commitment to safety and security here**](https://plaid.com/safety/). By utilizing Open Banking through Plaid, you acknowledge and agree that the terms of Plaid’s Privacy Policy will govern Plaid’s use of such information, and you expressly agree to the terms and conditions of Plaid’s Privacy Policy.

If your bank account is in the UK, Open Banking will be provided by TrueLayer Limited (a company with the registered address at Level 3, 1 Hardwick Street, London, UK, EC1R 4RB, UK, and company registration number 10278251). In providing the Open Banking for UK bank accounts in connection with the Website, we operate through our wholly-owned subsidiary, You Need A Budget UK Ltd (a company with the registered address at 4th Fl.

The Terms of Service set out the terms on which you agree to TrueLayer accessing information on your payment accounts for the purposes of transmitting that information to us. TrueLayer is subject to UK and EU data protection laws and is required to treat your data in accordance with those laws, as well as the Terms of Service and TrueLayer’s Privacy Policy. TrueLayer is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 and the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (Firm Reference Number: 901096).
