**USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY**

Private-Mail websites may use a first party cookie to collect anonymous traffic data, a form of aggregate information. “Cookies” are simple text files stored on your computer for use by a browser. Private-Mail may use “cookies” to assist in data collection and to track visitor website usage and trends to help us better serve you. If you reject cookies, you will still be able to view our websites, but your ability to use some areas of the websites will be limited. Some of our business partners and publishers (e.g., analytical tracking software providers) use cookies and tracking technologies on our websites. We have no access to or control over these third-party cookies or tracking technologies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies on our websites by us only and does not cover the use of cookies or tracking technologies by any such business partner.

When you visit Private-Mail’s website, Private-Mail automatically collects the name of the website you visited from (called the “referring page”) and the name of the website you chose to visit immediately after ours (called the “exit page”), and information about other websites you have recently visited. This information is used to improve our website, but we cannot identify you from any information we receive from cookies. Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, and our websites are not currently set up to respond to those signals for tracking on our websites.

Private-Mail may also participate in interest-based advertising using similar technology. Therefore, you may see advertising on our websites tailored to how you browse or shop, or you may see advertising for Private-Mail and its properties on other websites based on your browsing behavior across websites. Some websites where we may advertise belong to ad networks that use your web browsing history to choose which ads to display on their network websites; these ads include advertising for Private-Mail and its websites, but no personal information about you is shared with those third party ad networks. Other websites where you see our ads, such as Facebook, may use interest preferences that you have chosen on those sites, as well as registration and other information about you, to choose which ads to display to you. Some internet browsers, mobile devices, and websites such as Facebook may offer opt-outs for interest-based advertising. Please refer to the website that you are visiting, your browser, or your device settings for additional information.

You can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from third parties who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and DAA website ([http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)).
