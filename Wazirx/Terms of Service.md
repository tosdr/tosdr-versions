their existence, validity, termination, or any services or products provided and any

representations made by us) through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth

under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. You agree to first give us an

opportunity to resolve any claims by contacting us on our website / mobile / desktop

applications. If we are not able to resolve your claims within 60 days of receiving the

notice, you may seek relief through arbitration or in the Small Claims Tribunals of

Singapore (“SCT”), as set forth below.



Either you or Binance may submit a dispute (after having made good faith efforts to

resolve such dispute) for final and binding resolution by arbitration under the arbitration

rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), which are deemed to be

incorporated into these Terms by reference. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of a sole

arbitrator to be appointed by the President of SIAC. The language of the arbitration

hearings shall be English and the seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Singapore.

JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT

HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR OVER THE ASSETS OF THE

PARTY) AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS RENDERED.



Exceptions. Either party may instead choose to assert the claims in the SCT if the claims

fall within the jurisdiction of the SCT, and either party may seek injunctive relief or other

urgent equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. However, for the avoidance of

doubt, where the claims fall outside of the jurisdiction of the SCT, the claims will be

referred to and finally resolved by SIAC arbitration.



(ii) In the case of disputes, controversies or claims involving Zanmai, you and Zanmai agree

to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement (including any question regarding their

existence, validity, termination, or any services or products provided and any

representations made by us) through final and binding arbitration. You agree to first give

us an opportunity to resolve any claims by contacting us on our website / mobile /

desktop applications. If we are not able to resolve your claims within 60 days of

Either you or Zanmai may submit a dispute (after having made good faith efforts to resolve

such dispute) for final and binding resolution by arbitration under the arbitration rules of

the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), which are deemed to be

incorporated into these Terms by reference, read with the Indian Arbitration and

Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator to be

appointed by the President of SIAC. The language of the arbitration hearings shall be

English and the seat of arbitration shall be Singapore.



(b) Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT

AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, as applicable, instead electing

that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.

Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules

applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation

should arise between you and WazirX in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce

an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND WAZIRX WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY

TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.



(c) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE

SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR

LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS

OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR

LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER

CUSTOMER OR USER.



(d) Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award

of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to

maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a

party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to

enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.



(e) Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be

invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts

shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall

continue in full force and effect.



(f) Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement

may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or

affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.



(g) Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your

relationship with WazirX.



(h) Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency

equitable relief before a court of competent jurisdiction in order to maintain the status quo

pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other

rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.



(i) Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation and

infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade

secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.



14.2 Applicable Law. The laws of India excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and

any dispute that arises between you and Zanmai.



14.3 Force Majeure. WazirX is not responsible for damages caused by delay or failure to perform

undertakings under this Agreement when the delay or failure is due to fires; strikes; floods; power

outages or failures; acts of God or the state’s enemies; lawful acts of public authorities; any and all

market movements, shifts, or volatility; computer, server, or Internet malfunctions; security breaches or

cyberattacks; criminal acts; delays or defaults caused by common carriers; acts or omissions of third

parties; or, any other delays, defaults, failures or interruptions that cannot reasonably be foreseen or

provided against. In the event of force majeure, WazirX is excused from any and all performance

obligations and this Agreement shall be fully and conclusively at an end.



14.4 Electronic Communications. The communications between you and WazirX use electronic means,

whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether WazirX posts notices on the Site or communicates

with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from WazirX

in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and

other communications that WazirX provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such

communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your

non-waivable rights.



14.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with WazirX’s Privacy Policy, constitute the entire

agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any

right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section

titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word

“including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason,

held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the

invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the

maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to WazirX is that of an independent contractor,

and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations

herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without WazirX’s

prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of

the foregoing will be null and void. WazirX may freely assign this Agreement. The terms and conditions

set forth in this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.
