Cookie Policy
=============

This Cookie Policy outlines the manner in which BitChute uses "cookies" to enhance User experience of the BitChute website and associated services (collectively known as the "Service"). Please ensure that you read this Cookie Policy, the [**Terms & Conditions**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/terms) and the [**Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy) carefully. These are collectively known as the "Terms".

#### Your acceptance of these Terms

By using the Service, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, then please do not use the Service. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of changes to these Terms will be deemed as your acceptance of those changes. If you are accessing and using the Service on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or another legal entity, then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity.

#### Changes to the Terms and/or Service

BitChute has the discretion to update the Terms at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. It is important that you frequently review the Terms for any changes to stay informed. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically to become aware of modifications. As our Service is constantly evolving over time, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Service, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
