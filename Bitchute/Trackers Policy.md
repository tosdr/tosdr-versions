Cookie Policy
=============

This Cookie Policy outlines the manner in which BitChute, a service of Deep State Protocol, LLC ("DSP), uses "cookies" to enhance User experience of the BitChute website and associated services (collectively known as the "Service"). Please ensure that you read this Cookie Policy, the [**Terms & Conditions**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/terms) and the [**Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy) carefully. These are collectively known as the "Terms".

#### Your acceptance of these Terms

By using the Service, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, then please do not use the Service. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of changes to these Terms will be deemed as your acceptance of those changes. If you are accessing and using the Service on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or another legal entity, then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity.

#### Changes to the Terms and/or Service

DSP has the discretion to update the Terms at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. It is important that you frequently review the Terms for any changes to stay informed. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically to become aware of modifications. As our Service is constantly evolving over time, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Service, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

#### Terms & Conditions

Please refer to the [**Terms & Conditions**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/terms) for more information on the expected use of the Service.

#### Privacy Policy

Please refer to the [**Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy) for more information on how we collect, use and disclose the information we collect from our users.

Use of Cookies by the BitChute site and services
------------------------------------------------

Our Site uses "cookies" to enhance User experience. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. The User may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Service may not function properly. The table below explains the cookies we use and why:

BitChute Cookies
----------------

#### _cookielaw_

Used to remember a user's choice about cookies on [**BitChute**](https://bitchute.com/). Where users have previously indicated a preference, that user's preference will be stored in this cookie. 

#### _sessionid_

Used to store the identifier of the User's session on the Service. It is provided to the Service with requests to improve the User experience. It does not contain any personally identifiable information. For more information see [**BitChute Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy).

#### _csrftoken_

Used for security purposes to protect User accounts and the Service from Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. For more information see [**BitChute Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy).

**Note:** This cookie is strictly necessary for security and cannot be turned off.

#### _localStorage_

Used by the peer-to-peer streaming torrent technology that the Service utilizes, namely WebTorrent. For more information see [**BitChute Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy).

#### _registration_

Used to prevent over use of the register on BitChute drop down for unauthenticated users. For more information see [**BitChute Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy).

#### _announcement_

Used to help prevent the announcements being displayed multiple times. For more information see [**BitChute Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy).

#### _preferences_

Used to store the current preferences selections for the device. For more information see [**BitChute Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy).

Metrics Cookies
---------------

We use **Google Analytics** to perform site traffic analysis (not for advertising or marketing purposes). Google provides a browser extension you can use to opt-out of having your site activity available to Google Analytics. For more information [**see this support page from Google**](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en)**.**

Advertising Cookies
-------------------

We may use third-party services to help us deliver advertising messages to you. You may exercise your choices regarding the use of cookies by using options provided in the messages displayed to you on our site. Note that BitChute offers the ability for Registered Users to opt out of advertising entirely with the effect that this code will not be running on the version of the Service delivered to them. Go under Settings > Interface and scroll down to uncheck the "Show Adverts" box to exercise this option. Note, however, that advertising helps us cover the cost of delivering the Service. So if you decide to exercise this option, please consider supporting the platform with a [**BitChute Membership**](https://www.bitchute.com/membership/) package.

How do I change my cookie settings?

Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit [**www.aboutcookies.org**](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).
