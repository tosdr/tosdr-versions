Cookie Policy
=============

This Cookie Policy outlines the manner in which BitChute uses "cookies" to enhance User experience of the BitChute website and associated services (collectively known as the "Service"). Please ensure that you read this Cookie Policy, the [**Terms & Conditions**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/terms) and the [**Privacy Policy**](https://support.bitchute.com/policy/privacy) carefully. These are collectively known as the "Terms".

#### Your acceptance of these Terms

By using the Service, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, then please do not use the Service. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of changes to these Terms will be deemed as your acceptance of those changes. If you are accessing and using the Service on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or another legal entity, then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity.

#### Changes to the Terms and/or Service

BitChute has the discretion to update the Terms at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. It is important that you frequently review the Terms for any changes to stay informed. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically to become aware of modifications. As our Service is constantly evolving over time, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Service, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

#### Terms & Conditions

Advertising Cookies
-------------------

We may use third-party services such as Google Ad Manager to help us deliver advertising messages to you. You may exercise your choices regarding the use of cookies by Google Ad Manager by using options provided in the messages displayed to you on our site. You can also install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by going [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and following the instructions. Alternatively, BitChute offers the ability for Registered Users to opt out of advertising entirely with the effect that this code will not be running on the version of the Service delivered to them. Go under Settings > Interface and scroll down to uncheck the "Show Adverts" box to exercise this option. Note, however, that advertising helps us cover the cost of delivering the Service. So if you decide to exercise this option, please consider supporting the platform with a [**BitChute Membership**](https://www.bitchute.com/membership/) package.
