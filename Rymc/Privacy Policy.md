### Privacy Policy

I don't allow comments or uploads of any kind, and your information isn't tracked in any way beyond standard server logs (IP address at best, which is cleared often). I do use [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/ "Plausible - Private Analytics") for gaining some insight into where traffic is coming from, however their focus is on privacy and I find it gels well with my aims here. Nothing should be being record to identify any users - however, I am not a lawyer and you should confirm for yourself if you find yourself concerned over this.

### Cookies

Some parts of the world care about this, so here it is: no cookies are recorded on this page by me. I have no need for cookies for any functionality on this site that's been built by me, so you're good to go there.

### Terms and Copyright

Unless otherwise noted, all the content on here is copyright me, Ryan McGrath. I post my personal work and writings here, so this is hopefully straightforward. If you find that I've violated your copyright or trademark in any way, I encourage you to email me using the address at the top of this page, whereupon I'll do my best to resolve the matter quickly.
