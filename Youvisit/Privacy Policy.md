EAB and Our Commitment to Your Privacy
--------------------------------------

**Who Is EAB?** EAB Global, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and its affiliates, including Cappex.com, LLC d/b/a Appily, “EAB”, “us,” “we,” and “our”) drives transformative change through data-driven insights in five major areas: enrollment; student success; data & analytics; institutional strategy; and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). We partner with education leaders, practitioners, and staff to accelerate progress and drive results in the most pressing and complex issues facing colleges, universities, community colleges, K-12 school districts, independent schools, and graduate programs in the country. We also partner with more than 450 corporations to provide a collaboration platform among education and corporate leaders to address equity gaps.

**EAB’s Commitment to Privacy.**  EAB is deeply committed to maintaining the privacy and security of personal information we collect or which is provided to us directly by our clients. We value your trust in sharing your personal information with us and are dedicated to protecting your privacy, as further described in this Privacy Policy.

**Updates to this Privacy Policy.** From time to time, this Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes to our products and services, the way we operate, or to meet new legal and regulatory requirements. You will find the latest version of this Privacy Policy at [**https://eab.com/privacy-policy**](https://eab.com/privacy-policy).

**Scope of this Privacy Policy**
--------------------------------

This Privacy Policy governs the information collected through EAB.com and all services we provide directly to you, including the EAB Research Forums services. It applies to personal information that can be associated with an identified or identifiable person. This Privacy Policy does not relate to anonymized, aggregated, or de-identified data. Whether you are accessing one or more of our public websites, exploring employment opportunities through our job portal, participating in a research membership forum, or using one of our products via a software application, this Privacy Policy governs our use of personal information for all our products and services that we provide directly to you.  When we collect personal information directly from you in connection with our interactions with you, we are a data controller.

The following privacy notices provide additional information about certain of EAB’s services:

**Scope of your institution’s privacy policies.** If you are an employee, student, prospective student, or other end user of our client, and we are collecting your personal information in connection with the products and services we provide to our clients, we are a data processor. In this case, our use of your personal information is governed by the privacy policy of the institution from which we have received, or on whose behalf we collected or use, your personal information (“your institution”). Our Privacy Policy does not supersede the terms of any agreements between us and your institution, nor does it affect the terms of any agreements between you and your institution, including any prior consent you have provided concerning the use and distribution of your personal information.

Information That We Collect
---------------------------

The type of personal information we collect about you depends upon your relationship with us. Please click on the plus symbol to collapse or expand the relevant section below to learn more. The other sections in our Privacy Policy apply to all our activities.

### Website Visitors and EAB Research Forums Users

EAB maintains websites that are generally accessible by the public.  Our websites provide general information about our company and its products and services.  Our websites also may contain information concerning employment opportunities and provide the opportunity for individuals to submit applications for open roles.  We may do this directly or through third party vendors.

You can generally visit our websites without having to register or otherwise identify yourself. You may need to log in to make use of all the functionalities and be able to communicate with us or other EAB clients. For example, our website allows our clients’ registered users that subscribe to our research forums to access reports and other data.  Our research forums may also provide additional functionality that registered users can access through our website.

We collect personal information in the following manner:

* **Directly from you**: We collect certain personal information directly from you, including your name, email address, institution and role, and account credentials when you register on one or more of our websites. You also may provide personal information to us in connection with your use of the user forums, for example if you attend sessions or events, or if you link your LinkedIn or Twitter account with your EAB Research Forums account, or through the automated virtual assistant and live chat features on our websites.
* **Indirectly from you**: We collect information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps and other online features and services for analytics purposes (including the pages you visit and how you access and use our services using cookies and third-party analytics tools (e.g., log files, event data, GPS data, clear gifs and scripts)). This information includes information about the device(s) you use to access the service including unique device identifiers, IP address, operating system, browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, clickstream data and cookies. Depending on your device settings, we may also collect information about your geographical location. We may use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics to collect this information. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of EAB’s service or help administer EAB’s services.  To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).  To learn more about Adobe Analytics, please visit https://www.adobe.com/privacy.html.Learn more about our use of cookies, plugins, analytics or similar tools in our [**Cookie Notice**](https://eab.com/cookie-notice/).
* **Sensitive Information.** We may obtain information relating to your gender or gender identity, and information relating to your health, such as any disabilities, where we are permitted to do so by law or where you give your consent, as required by applicable law.
* **Third Party Integrations, Links and Features.** You may connect third party integrations to your EAB account(s) (e.g., Google SSO), which may ask for certain permissions to send information to your EAB.com account. EAB’s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy). These third parties operate independently from us. The privacy practices of the relevant third parties, including details on the information they may collect about you, are subject to the privacy statements of these parties, which we suggest you review. To the extent any linked online service or third-party feature is not owned or controlled by EAB, we are not responsible for these third parties’ information practices.

### End User of an Institution That Uses Our Products

**Your institution decides how your personal information is used.** We provide nearly all of our products and services to end users of an institution as a “data processor” on behalf of our clients (e.g., colleges, universities, and school districts). This means that the main responsibility for data privacy compliance lies with your institution as a “data controller.” It also means that your institution’s privacy policy governs the use of your personal information (rather than ours). Your institution determines what information we collect through our products and services and how it is used, and we process your information according to your institution’s explicit instructions.

The following section is primarily for informational purposes and describes how your information is generally collected when we provide products and services to you on behalf of a client. How your personal information is used depends on your institution, so you should read your institution’s privacy policy carefully.

We collect personal information in the following manner:

    * Your name, email address, student ID, account credentials, course enrollment data, grades, and directory information.

    * Other information directly from your institution or other third parties related to your enrollment or application status at your institution, or other institutions, or related to your success at your institution.
* **Received directly from you**: Depending on the EAB products and services you use or your institution uses, we may collect the following types of identifiable information:
    * Your name, email address, and similar contact data when you provide or update this information in our products.

    * Your credentials for your institution’s systems account(s) to the extent our products integrate with such systems.
    * Content that you enter directly into our products, including results of surveys or polls, notes and summaries, academic and career preferences.
* **Indirectly from you**: We collect information on your use of our products and services. Depending on the products and services you access or use, we may collect the following data categories indirectly from you:
    * Usage: We collect information about the pages you visit and how you access and use our products using cookies and third-party analytics tools. This information includes information about the device(s) you use to access the websites including unique device identifiers, IP address, operating system, browser and cookies. Depending on your device settings, we may also collect information about your geographical location. Learn more about our use of cookies in our [**Cookie Notice**](https://eab.com/cookie-notice/).
