**21\. Applicable Law and Venue**

These Site Terms and your use of the Site and Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the State of Washington applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Washington (even if your use is outside of the State of Washington), without resort to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that with respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration (as set forth below), any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Site, the Services or these Site Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. The requirements in this paragraph 21 shall not apply where and to the extent they are prohibited by the local law in the country where you live.

**22\. Arbitration**

You and Company agree that except as otherwise specifically provided in this paragraph, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Site Terms, or the breach thereof, or to the Site and/or the Services shall be settled exclusively by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, in the case of consumer disputes, with the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), and that judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that either of us has in any manner infringed upon or violated or threatened to infringe upon or violate the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret rights, then the parties acknowledge that arbitration is not an adequate remedy at law and that without waiving any remedy under these Site Terms, injunctive or other appropriate relief may be sought from any court specified in Section 21 (above). The place of arbitration and the allocation of costs and fees for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with such AAA Rules. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration or claim shall be joined to any other arbitration or claim, and no class arbitration proceedings shall be permitted. In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Site or the Services be instituted more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose. In the event that any term of this Section 22 (Arbitration) is held to be in conflict with a mandatory provision of applicable law, such conflicting term shall be modified automatically to comply with such provision and the remainder of this Section 22 shall not be affected.

**23\. Termination**

Notwithstanding any of these Site Terms, Company reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Site and the Services, and to block or prevent your access to and use of the Site and the Services.

**24\. Severability**

If any provision of these Site Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Site Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
