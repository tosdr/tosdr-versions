Cookie Policy
=============

Last Updated: 5th June 2023
---------------------------

Network18 Media and Investments Ltd. (“we”, “us”) understands that privacy is important to the data subject (“you”, “your”, “user”, “subscriber”) and we are committed to being transparent about the technologies we use. This Cookie Policy explains how and why cookies and other similar technologies may be stored on and accessed from your device when you use or visit the Our Websites that post a link to this Policy (collectively, “the Sites”). This Cookie Policy should be read together with our Privacy Policy.

What are cookies and other tracking technologies?
-------------------------------------------------

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, and font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you re-visit the site or browse different pages. The other tracking technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, sdk files, scripts) work in a manner similar to the working of cookies and place small data files on your devices to monitor your website activity and enable us to collect information about how you use Our Websites. This allows Our Websites to uniquely identify your device from those of other users of the websites. The information about cookies provided below also applies to the other tracking technologies.

How do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?
------------------------------------------------------

We use cookies to collect and store information when you visit our website and use the website’s services. We use cookies for various purposes such as:  
a. To provide subscription services  
b. To provide non-personalized or personalized advertisements  
c. To identify your location  
d. To identify your browser and device  
e. For analytics and research,  
f. To measure and analyze the audience for each page in order to subsequently improve the ergonomics, browsing, or visibility of content;  
g. To measure the reliability of Our Websites by analyzing the number of visits to its pages in real time, and offer varied ads that are adapted to users’ areas of interest;  

Cookies may also be saved by social media tools if you use these functionalities (e.g. Facebook, Google, & Twitter).

How long do cookies stay on your device?
----------------------------------------

We do not store information for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purposes covered herein. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Others are used to remember you when you return to the Website and will last from 1 day to 2 years, depending on the purpose.

Type of Cookies
---------------

### First-party cookies

These are the cookies that belong to us and that we place on your device or are those set by a website that is being visited by you at the time. These cookies will be used for tracking purposes for aggregated data.

### Third-party cookies

These cookies are those that another party places on your device through our site (For e.g. advertising agencies may place their cookies on our website which will collect tracking information and serve you with advertisements).

We use the following types of cookies:
--------------------------------------

### Persistent Cookies

We use persistent cookies to improve your experience of using the websites. This includes recording your acceptance of our Cookie Policy to remove the cookie message which first appears when you visit the Site.

### Session Cookies

Session Cookies are temporary and deleted from your device when your web browser closes. We use session Cookies to help us track internet usage as described above.

You may refuse to accept browser Cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse Cookies, our system will check if Cookies can be captured when you direct your browser to our website. We categorize cookies as follows:

### Strictly Necessary/Technical

These Cookies are necessary to allow us to operate our websites so you may access them as you have requested. These Cookies, for example, let us recognize that you have created an account and have logged in/out to access website content.

For example, these Cookies track what type of articles are most frequently visited and which locations we receive most of our visitors from. If you subscribe to a newsletter or otherwise register with the websites, these Cookies may be correlated to you. These Cookies include, for example, Google Analytics cookies.

### Functionality

These Cookies let us operate the websites in accordance with the choices you make. These Cookies permit us to "remember" you in-between visits.
