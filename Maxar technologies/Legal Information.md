##### 1\. Scope of this Statement

This Privacy Statement addresses personal information of individuals who use our Services, visit maxar.com, or provide their personal information to Maxar for visitation, sales, marketing or customer service purposes. This Privacy Statement does not address personal information of Maxar employees or third-party service providers, such as contractors and consultants, or applicants for those positions, that is collected in connection with such relationships. Employees, third-party service providers, and applicants should consult the other privacy statements applicable to their role or contract with Maxar.    

##### 2\. Information We Collect

Maxar collects information from and about individuals from the individuals themselves, from individuals’ employers pursuant to a business-to-business contract between Maxar and the employer, from open sources of public information and from automated means.

##### 2.1. Information Collected from Individuals or Their Employers

If you or your employer purchase a product or service from us directly or through one of our partners, or if you or your employer request product information or updates from us, we may collect information about you to facilitate delivery and provide services related to that product or request. Similarly, if you or your employer sell a product or service to us, we may collect information about you to accomplish that transaction. If you visit a Maxar facility, we may collect certain information about you in order to permit access. Information that we collect in these various circumstances may include:

* **Contact information**, such as your name, postal address, telephone and facsimile numbers, email address, country of residence, and country of citizenship.
* **Employment information**, such as your employer, job title or role, department, sector, area or industry, and country of employment.
* **Account information**, such as your account name, supervisor and assistant’s name, telephone number and email address.
* **Product Ordering Information**, such as an order ID, order value, purchase date, product information
* **Account access credentials**, such as your login and password for Maxar Services, which are used to validate authorized access to Maxar Services.
* **Financial information**, such as credit card or wire transfer information, and shipping and billing postal addresses.
* **Communications preferences** and interests in Maxar products.

In some cases when you register for in-person events that are hosted by Maxar, we will collect certain additional information that is necessary to facilitate your attendance, which may include:

* Dietary restrictions.
* Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.

##### 2.2. Information Collected from Third-Party Sources

We may acquire information from third-party sources that are either publicly or commercially available. This information could include personal data such as your name, address, email address, preferences, interests, and demographic data.

We may combine personal information collected from individuals who use our Services with other information that we or third parties collect about you in other contexts, such as our communications with you via email or telephone, or your customer service records. We treat such combined information as personal information and protect it in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

##### 2.3. Information Collected Automatically

When you visit a webpage affiliated with our Services, we may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies and web server logs.

Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or store information or settings on your device. Our Services may use cookies, as well as other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. You also may be able to delete your cookies or adjust your cookie settings by visiting the browser’s settings panel. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our websites and Services.

In conjunction with gathering information through cookies, our web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. We also may record information such as the address of the webpage that referred you to our Service and the IP address of the device you use to connect to our Service. We also may log information about your interaction with the Services, such as which pages you visit. We may place tags on our web pages called “web beacons,” which are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies. 

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics, Hotjar, Adobe Marketo Munchkin, Twitter Pixel, Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Pixel, Demandbase Tag, and Google AdRoll. These service providers help us analyze how you use our Services. The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.

Both we and others (such as our service providers and advertising networks) may collect personal information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites. Our Services are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.

The provider of other third-party plug-ins on our Services, such as embedded videos and social sharing tools, may use automated means to collect information regarding your use of the Services and your interactions with the plug-ins. This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of third-party plug-in providers and is not subject to this Privacy Statement. 

##### 3\. How We Use the Information We Collect

Maxar uses your personal information in a variety of ways, depending on how you interact with our Services. These uses may include:

* To maintain and provide you with access to our Services.
* To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries or instructions concerning our Services.
* To fulfill underlying transactions on our Services, including, when applicable, sharing personal information with our regulators or to obtain necessary licenses.
* To allow access to account information and Service features.
* To deliver confirmations, account information, notifications, updates, and similar operational communications.
* To improve your online experience and the quality of our Services.
* To market and advertise our Services.
* To maintain the integrity of our network, perform crime or fraud monitoring, and address security issues involving our Services.
* To comply with legal and/or regulatory requirements.
* To prevent or monitor crime or fraud, protect our legal rights and perform contractual obligations.

We also use the information you provide to send you communications, including promotional messages about Maxar and topics of interest, as permitted by local law and subject to your contact preferences. Although we hope you will find our promotional communications of interest, you are able to opt out of receiving them by contacting Maxar as indicated in the [How to Contact Us](#HowtoContactUs) section of this Statement.

We also may use the information in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.

In addition, we may use information collected through automated means for the purposes set forth above, including by customizing your visits to our Services, analyzing the manner in which all of our users interact with our Services and online advertisements, delivering content tailored to our users’ interests and managing our Services and other aspects of our business.

##### 4\. The Legal Basis for Our Use of Personal Data (European Economic Area visitors only)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data we collect (described above) depends on the personal data we collect and the context under which we collect it. In any case, we will collect and process your personal data only in at least one of the following circumstances: (i) we have your consent, (ii) where the processing is for our legitimate interests, (iii) where we have a legal obligation to collect the data, or (iv) where the personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you, and each not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear and also tell you whether the requirement for that information is mandatory and explain any consequences to you if you do not provide the information. Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information based on our legitimate interests, we will provide clear notice to describe our legitimate interests.

Maxar Technologies Holdings Inc. is the data controller of the personal information collected from individuals in the EEA, unless otherwise indicated.

If you have any questions about our legal basis for processing personal data or need to contact us regarding your data rights, please contact us at [privacy@maxar.com](mailto:privacy@maxar.com).   

##### 5\. Information We Share

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information we collect about you, except as described in this Privacy Statement. We may share personal information with contractors and service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. We may share certain personal information with Maxar subsidiaries and affiliates to provide a more unified user experience for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. These subsidiaries and affiliates may be located in different countries than your own and may have different and potentially lower data privacy standards than those of your home country.

In addition, we may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or legal process, to law enforcement authorities or other government entities, and when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual espionage, cybersecurity or security events or other fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, spin-off, dissolution or liquidation).

##### 6\. Location of Data Processing

Personal information that Maxar processes or controls is transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which Maxar or its affiliates or subcontractors maintain facilities. The data protection laws in these countries are different from, and could be less stringent than, those in your country of residence. When we transfer personal information to recipients in other countries, we take steps to see that the information we collect under this Privacy Statement is processed according to the provisions of this Privacy Statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.

If you are located in the EEA, the United Kingdom (“UK”) or Switzerland, we will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to recipients in countries outside of the EEA, the UK or Switzerland. For transfers within or between Maxar and its subsidiaries and affiliates, the steps we take include entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses which contractually obligate each member to ensure that personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection. If we transfer personal information outside of Maxar or to contractors and service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions, we will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect personal information.

##### 7\. Retention of Personal Information

Maxar stores your personal information for as long as you use the Services, and no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected, for which it is legitimately further processed, or required for compliance with legal requirements. Thereafter, Maxar retains personal information for a period of time set forth in its corporate retention schedules. In the case of data obtained under business-to-business agreements, Maxar retains personal information according to the timeframes set forth in those relevant customer agreements, or in lieu of an agreement, for as long as a legitimate business purpose exists.

##### 8\. Security of Personal Information

Maxar is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We have implemented and will maintain appropriate administrative, technical and organizational measures to protect your information against accidental loss, destruction or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, or unlawful destruction. Networks, however, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure the security of any personal information provided to us.

If you believe your information has been compromised, please notify us immediately at [privacy@maxar.com](mailto:privacy@maxar.com).

##### 9\. Your Rights and Choices

We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we collect from you. To update your preferences or elect any of your rights, please contact us as indicated in the [How to Contact Us](#HowtoContactUs) section of this Privacy Statement.

To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may request access to the personal information we maintain about you or request that we correct, amend, delete or block the information by contacting us as indicated below. Where provided by law, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us or object at any time on legitimate grounds to the processing of your personal information, and we will apply your preferences going forward. Please note that we are obligated to verify your identity before we provide you with any personal data. If you request a change to or deletion of your personal data, please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion. Some of your information may also remain in our systems and other records where necessary for compliance with applicable law.

##### 10\. California Business Contact Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident and we receive your personal information, such as in the form of contact details from business events, for example as part of a business appointment (e.g., by exchanging business cards) or as part of any other form of collaboration, we may use your contact and business details to maintain our business contacts. For this purpose, we may transfer your contact details to our internal database.  Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, “CCPA”), you have privacy rights with respect to your business contact personal information.

The processing activity may include the following categories of personal information:

* Your contact information (e.g., name, title, form of address or salutation, address, gender, telephone numbers, email address);
* Details on your profession (e.g., job title, position, personnel number, place of work, branch office, department, qualifications), and
* The other categories of personal information set forth in section 2.1 above.

This data processing is based on our legitimate business interests. We have a legitimate economic interest in maintaining contacts beyond the initial context and in using them to establish and develop a business relationship and to remain in contact with the parties concerned.

Such business contacts could also be processed in our email communications with you and then kept in typical business software, either centrally or on the electronic devices of our employees. 

California law provides you with the following rights with respect to your personal information:

* The right to know what personal information we have collected, used, or disclosed about you.
* The right to request that we delete any personal information we have collected about you.
* The right to correct inaccurate personal information about you.
* The right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information about you.

We do not sell or share your personal information, as defined by the CCPA.

##### 10.1.                Submitting Requests

California residents have the right to limit the use of their sensitive personal information.  However, that right does not apply because we do not use sensitive personal information for any additional purposes that are incompatible with the purposes listed above, unless we provide you with notice of those additional purposes.

You may submit requests to correct, delete, and know specific personal information and/or categories of personal information we have collected about you by contacting us at [privacy@maxar.com](mailto:privacy@maxar.com) or dial 1-800-496-1225.

##### 10.2.                Verification of Your Identity

When you exercise these rights and submit a request to us, we or our partners will verify your identity by asking you to authenticate your identity via standard authentication procedures.  For example, we  may ask for your email address, order numbers of previous orders of our products and services, full name, street address, or the date of your last purchase from us.  We also may use a third-party verification provider to verify your identity.

##### 10.3.                Non-Discrimination

If you make a request under the CCPA, we will not discriminate against you in any way.  For example, we will not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, deny you discounts or other benefits or impose penalties on you, or provide you with or suggest that you will receive a different level or quality of goods or services.

##### 10.4.                Automated Decision-Making

We generally do not use automated decision-making technology, as that term is defined by the CCPA. If we make use of automated decision-making technology, you will be informed through a separate privacy notice.

##### 10.5.                Record Retention

We may retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. We strive to retain your personal information no longer than is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement or as required by law.  We retain your personal information following the end of your services or other business relationship in accordance with applicable law and our data retention and destruction policies.

##### 11.           Response to Do-Not-Track Signals

Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals.  Since uniform standards for “Do Not Track” signals have not yet been adopted, Maxar does not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals.

##### 12.           Links to Other Websites

Our Services may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites may operate independently from us. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. To the extent any linked websites are not owned or controlled by us, we are not responsible for the websites’ content, any use of the websites, or the privacy practices of the websites, even though you may enter that site directly from visiting ours.
