Third-Party Services
--------------------

Our Sites and Services may contain links to or integrations with other websites or applications not operated or controlled by Vercel (“Third-Party Services”). Certain Third-Party Services used to navigate to and from our Sites and Services have separate user terms and privacy notices that are independent of this Notice. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, or opinions expressed in such Third-Party Services. We do not monitor or check these Third-Party Services for accuracy or completeness. We recommend carefully reviewing the terms and privacy notices of each Third-Party Service prior to use in alignment with your specific compliance, privacy, and security requirements.

How We Transfer Your Information
--------------------------------

If you are accessing or using our Sites and Services or otherwise providing your information to us, you consent to the processing of your information in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate.

To provide our Sites and Services, Vercel may store, process and transmit your information outside of your country of residence, which may have different data protection laws and may not offer the same level of protection or guarantees as in your country or the country where you initially provided the information. To the extent required by applicable law, whenever we transfer your information, we take the appropriate steps to protect your information, including the use of standard contractual clauses or other appropriate legal mechanisms.

Data Privacy Framework
----------------------

Vercel complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and, upon entering into force, the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Vercel has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Vercel has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that, upon entering into force, it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Notice and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit the [Data Privacy Framework website](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Vercel commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information.

For onward transfers, Vercel is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Vercel remains liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Vercel proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Vercel commits to cooperate and comply respectively with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs), the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority (GRA), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF.

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Vercel’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF).

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Vercel is obligated to arbitrate claims and follow the terms as set forth in [Annex I of the DPF Principles](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction). You have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms. For additional information please see [Annex I](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction).
