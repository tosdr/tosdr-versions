### 15.1. Plans

The Services will be provided according to the plan level you select. There is a free hobby plan and there are paid self-service subscription plans ("self-service subscriptions"). For an enterprise license, you may contact Vercel separately.

For self-service subscriptions, additional Services added to your self-service subscription, and domain registrations, you will be charged a fee and any applicable tax. Fees will be billed to the credit card or other payment account you provide in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. **You acknowledge and agree that Vercel will automatically charge your credit card or other payment account on record with Vercel in connection with your use of the Services: (i) in advance of each self-service subscription term, for the self-service subscription you have selected and any additional Services added to your self-service subscription; (ii) in arrears for any additional Services you have used or added to your self-service subscription during the prior self-service subscription term; and (iii) on purchase of any domain registration and up to thirty (30) days prior to each annual anniversary of your purchase.

You will reimburse Vercel any pre-approved and agreed upon costs. Vercel may change its fees and payment terms at its discretion; provided however, that such changes will not take effect for you until the start of the next payment period.

#### 20.3.1 Disputes with a Domestic Customer

If you are located and headquartered in the United States of America, you and Vercel each irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the San Francisco County, California for all proceedings arising out of this contract or related to the parties' relationship, and you and Vercel agree to only institute such proceedings in those courts.

#### 20.3.2. Disputes with a Foreign Customer

If you are located and headquartered outside of the United States of America, then any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law. Any dispute between you and Vercel that is not resolved through negotiation will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the then-current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("**JAMS**"). The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by agreement of you and Vercel or, if you and Vercel cannot agree, an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the JAMS rules who shall be experienced in the type of dispute at issue. You and Vercel, their representatives, the arbitrator, and other participants shall keep confidential the existence, content, and result of the arbitration.

The arbitration will be conducted in the English language; the location of such arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. Each party will bear its own costs in the arbitration. The arbitrator will have full power and authority to determine issues of arbitrability and to interpret or construe the provisions of the agreement documents and to fashion appropriate remedies (including temporary, preliminary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief); provided that the arbitrator will not have any right or authority: (i) in excess of the authority that a court having jurisdiction over the parties and the dispute would have absent this arbitration agreement; or (ii) to award damages in excess of the types and limitation of damages found in the Agreement. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate, each party may apply at any time to a court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate injunctive relief or for other interim or conservatory measures, and by doing so will not breach or waive the agreement to arbitrate or impair the powers of the arbitrator.

  

#### 20.3.3. Opt-Out

You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to: [privacy@vercel.com](mailto:privacy@vercel.com) with the subject line "COMPANY ARBITRATION OPT-OUT".
