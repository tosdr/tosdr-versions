We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

**Opting-Out of Automated Cookies** **and Third-Party Advertising**

As stated in this Policy, we may collect and share your personal information for third-party advertising purposes. We do this through the use of cookies and other automated tracking technologies.

Residents of Colorado may opt out of targeted advertising, as defined under the Colorado Privacy Act, by setting their browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert them when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly. Colorado residents may opt out of targeted advertising using the online web form on the footer of our website.

**Accessing, Correcting, and Deleting Your Information**

As part of our efforts to provide residents of Colorado with control over their personal information, residents of Colorado or their authorized agent may email us at [webmaster@unicefusa.org](mailto:webmaster@unicefusa.org) to request access to, correction, deletion, or portability of their personal information. When we receive a request, we may be required to verify your identity in accordance with the Verifying Requests section, below.

Please note that we may decline to accommodate an access, correction, or deletion request where we are required or permitted to retain the information. We similarly may refuse to accommodate a request if we believe doing so would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. Should an exemption apply, we will notify you of the exemption in our response to your request.

Additionally, to the extent that we deny your request, residents of Colorado may appeal such decision by emailing us at [webmaster@unicefusa.org](mailto:webmaster@unicefusa.org)

**Verifying Requests**

When we receive a request, we may be obligated to verify that the person requesting information or deletion is the person to whom the data request relates. This verification process is critical to maintaining the privacy and security of the personal data that you entrust to us. To verify a request, we may request up to three pieces of personal information about you to compare against our records. We may also request that you sign a declaration under the penalty of perjury from the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.
