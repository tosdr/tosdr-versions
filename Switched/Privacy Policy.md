### 1\. What is the purpose of this document?

1.1. We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This privacy notice sets out the basis on which we process any personal data we collect about users of Switched via [https://switchedapp.com](https://switchedapp.com/) (the **Website**) or the Switched mobile application available from the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store or our Website (the **App**), and how that information will be processed by us.

1.2. This privacy notice applies to: visitors to our Website and users of our App who do not register as well as those who do; any customers that purchase services and/or digital content from us via the Website or the App or otherwise; and all individual contractors and service providers who provide services to our business ( **you** ).

1.3. We are a **data controller**. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you, and for explaining this clearly to you.

1.4. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us at [contact@ed2.digital](mailto:contact@ed2.digital).

1.5. Please read this privacy notice carefully to understand what we do with your personal information and what rights you have in relation to our activities.

1.6. Our Website and our App are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.

### 2\. What is personal data and our lawful basis for processing

2.1. Personal data, or personal information, means any information relating to an individual from which that person can be identified. There are special categories of more sensitive personal information which require a higher level of protection (see further at section 3.4, below).

2.2. We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Our principle lawful basis for processing is set out in the table below. However, some of our grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.

2.3. We may only rely on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) to process your personal information, if your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Where we rely on legitimate interests for our processing, we have set out the relevant interest, below.

2.4. Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data except that:

2.4.1. if you are a private individual, we will get your consent before sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message; and

2.4.2. we obtain your consent to our processing of your special category information which you voluntarily provide when you sign up and accept the Switched Terms of Use and Service.

You have the right to withdraw consent at any time by contacting us.

2.5 We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

2.6. Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.

2.7. Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with services or digital content). In this case, we may have to cancel a service or digital content you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

### 3\. Data we collect about you

3.1. Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

However you may choose to provide to us special category personal information about your sex life and sexual orientation and your race or ethnicity and you consent to our processing this information when you agree to the Switched Terms of Use and Service.

3.5 We also may process personal information (including special category information):
