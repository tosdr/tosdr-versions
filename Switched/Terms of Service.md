In the event of such a breach, your right to use Switched will cease immediately.

**Switched provides interactive services** which may include forums, bulletin boards, instant messaging and chat rooms. In relation to any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).

We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks.

### 6\. PAID-FOR FEATURES AND CONTENT

**You may choose to purchase additional or enhanced Switched features or content (Add-Ons):**

* by subscribing to make monthly or yearly payments; or
* by purchasing Switched Beads, our virtual credits which you can exchange for Add-Ons.

**How to pay.** Payment for subscriptions or purchases initiated via the App will be taken via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Payment for subscriptions or purchases initiated via the Website will be taken by our payment processor Stripe. Please note that Apple's, Google' or Stripe's terms will be applicable depending on which method of payment is used.

**Subscription payments will be taken monthly or yearly** (depending on your choices on signing up) starting on the date that you sign up for the subscription. Payments will be taken automatically by direct debit and you will have access to the Add-Ons which you subscribed for until you or we end your subscription as set out below.

**Payments for Switched Beads will be taken immediately** and the Beads will be available in your account for you to use shortly after payment has been received by us.

**We may increase subscription payments.** From time to time we may increase the costs of Add-Ons and thereby increase your subscription payments. We will always notify you in writing to the email address registered to your account at least 2 months in advance if we are going to do this, giving you the opportunity to cancel.

**We may have to suspend the availability of Add-Ons** for example to deal with technical problems or to make minor changes or improvements. If we have to suspend Add-Ons for longer than 48 hours in any month we will offer you Switched Beads as compensation. If Add-Ons are suspended for a period of more than 1 month you will be entitled to end your subscription and obtain a refund as set out below.

**We may also suspend your access to Add-Ons if you do not pay.** If we do not receive payment when we are supposed to and you still do not make payment within 3 days of us reminding you that payment is due, we may suspend your access to Add-Ons until you have paid us the outstanding amounts. We will contact you to tell you we are suspending your access.

**Ending your subscription.** You can cancel your subscription at any time by emailing us at [support@switchedapp.com](mailto:support@switchedapp.com) or completing the form on the Website at [https://switchedapp.com/support](https://switchedapp.com/support). If you have a monthly subscription, your cancellation will be effective one month from the date that your last subscription payment was due. If you have a yearly subscription, your cancellation will be effective one year from the date that your last subscription payment was due. Once we receive your cancellation, we will stop taking your subscription payments. You will continue to have access to Add-Ons you have paid for, for the period up until your next payment would have been due.

**Ending your subscription and obtaining a refund.** If you end your subscription and request a refund for any of the reasons set out below, then your subscription and access will both end immediately and we will refund part or all of your most recent subscription payment. The amount that we refund you will depend on the proportion of the month during which you had access to Add-Ons. The reasons are:

* we have told you about or there has been a change to the Add-Ons or these terms which you do not agree to;
* there is a risk that availability of the Add-Ons may be suspended for a significant period of time because of events outside our control;
* we have suspended availability of the Add-Ons for technical reasons, or notify you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, for a period of more than 1 week; or
* you have a legal right to end this contract with us because of something we have done wrong.

**How we will refund you.** We will make any refunds due to you by the method that you used for payment and as soon as possible.

**If there is a problem** with the Add-Ons or Switched Beads that you have paid for, or with the payment process, then please contract us as [support@switchedapp.com](mailto:support@switchedapp.com).

**Your legal rights as a consumer.** We are under a legal duty to supply services (the Add-Ons) and digital content (the Switched Beads) that are in conformity with these terms. Nothing in these terms will affect your legal rights. If there is a problem with the Add-Ons or the Switched Beads which you have paid for, you may be entitled to a refund. You will need to contact the entity from which you purchased your Switched Beads or subscription (which may be the Apple App Store or Google Play Store) to request a refund.

* **We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us.** If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these terms or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time you accepted these terms, both we and you knew it might happen.
* **We are not liable for business losses.** We provide Switched for domestic and private use only. You agree not to use Switched for any commercial, business or resale purposes, and we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.
* **We may be liable for damage to your property.** If defective digital content that we have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you and this is caused by our failure to use reasonable care and skill, we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation. However, we will not be liable for damage that you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly follow installation instructions or to have in place the minimum system requirements advised by us.

**We are not responsible for viruses.** We do not guarantee that Switched will be secure or free from bugs or viruses. You are responsible for configuring your information technology, computer programmes and platform to access Switched. You should use your own virus protection software.

**There are limitations to Switched.** Switched is provided primarily for social and entertainment purposes. It does not offer advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of information obtained from Switched. Although we make reasonable efforts to update any information that we provided through Switched, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that such information is accurate, complete or up to date.

**We are not responsible for events outside our control.** If our provision of Switched or support for Switched is delayed by an event outside our control then we will take steps as soon as possible to minimise the effect of the delay. We will not be liable for delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay then you may contact us or the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (depending on where your purchase was made) to end any subscription and receive a refund for any features you have paid for but not received, which will reflect the period that Switched has been available to you prior to cancellation. Please see section "6 Paid-for features and content".

**We are not responsible for other websites you link to.** Switched may contain links to other independent websites which are not provided by us. Such independent sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and have not checked and approved their content or their privacy policies (if any). You will need to make your own independent judgement about whether to use any such independent sites, including whether to buy any products or services offered by them.

### 9\. WHO MAY HAVE RIGHTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT

**We may transfer this agreement to someone else.** We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract. If you are unhappy with the transfer you may then you may contact us or the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (depending on where your purchase was made) to end any subscription and receive a refund for any features you have paid for but not received, which will reflect the period that Switched has been available to you prior to cancellation. Please see section "6. Paid-for features and content".

**You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else.** You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.

**Third parties do not have rights under these terms.** These terms are between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of these terms. These terms do not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term.

### 10\. HOW THESE TERMS MAY BE ENFORCED

**We may end your rights to use Switched if you break these terms.** We may disable your account and end your rights to use Switched at any time if, in our reasonable opinion, you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these terms. If what you have done can be put right we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.

If we end your rights to use Switched you must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including your use of the App.

**If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force.** Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.

**Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later.** If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.

**These terms are governed by the law of England and Wales.** The courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction, except that if you are a consumer and a resident of Northern Ireland or Scotland then you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland or Scotland, as applicable.
