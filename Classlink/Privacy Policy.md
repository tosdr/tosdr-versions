ClassLink is committed to ensuring data privacy  
Updated March 2024  

ClassLink is committed to ensuring that your information is secure and your privacy is protected. The information below outlines our privacy and security policies. Additional information is contained in our software license and service level agreements. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we store. Learn more about our [security protocols](https://www.classlink.com/company/security).  

Our Guiding Principles on Personal Data
---------------------------------------

* **Data Ownership:** ClassLink acknowledges that all personally identifiable information (PII) about students, teachers, administrators, and parents is the property of the customers that ClassLink serves.  
    
* **Purpose:** ClassLink is a trusted steward of personal data. Data received from its customers is to be used solely for purposes of providing educational services. Such data will not be sold or used for marketing purposes. Customers may use ClassLink tools to share data with educational vendors of their choice.  
    
* **Type of Data Maintained in ClassLink:** ClassLink maintains personal data needed for the satisfactory operation of the ClassLink system, and to enable services including single sign-on and rostering for the customers that it serves. This data includes what is generally regarded as [Directory Information](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/content/directory-information) such as name, school building affiliation, grade level, and email address. ClassLink may also maintain profile pictures, cell phone numbers for students age 13+ (to send password reset verification codes), student ID numbers, login credentials for various online resources, and personal computer files (temporarily cached for file transfers between cloud drives and stored until deleted by user for the ClassLink cloud drive). ClassLink does not generally maintain information such as mailing address, gender, date of birth, and other personal demographic data.  
    
* **Protection:** ClassLink keeps all personal data confidential and secure. ClassLink team members are bound by contractual non-disclosure agreements. ClassLink’s data security protections include: internal data management policies and procedures, limitations on access to personal data, data encryption (for both data in transit and at rest), data systems monitoring, incident response plans, and safeguards to ensure personal data is not accessed by unauthorized persons when transmitted over communication networks. ClassLink may disclose personal data to public authorities if required by lawful requests.  
    
* **Disposal of Data:** ClassLink permanently deletes personal data after the termination of a contract, when no longer needed, or when advised to do so by the customer.  
    
* **Correction:** ClassLink enables users, or their authorized parents, to review personal information maintained in ClassLink and correct erroneous information.  
    
* **Discovery of a Security Breach That Results in Unauthorized Release of Personal Data:** ClassLink shall promptly notify affected customers of such breach, shall conduct an investigation, and shall restore the integrity of its data systems as soon as possible. ClassLink will fully cooperate and assist with required notices to those individuals affected by such breach.  
    
* **Financial Protection:** ClassLink shall maintain business insurance policies to protect the customers that it serves.

International – [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/), introduced by Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and The Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ClassLink is a signatory to the Student Privacy Pledge and abides by the commitments therein as follows:  

1. Not collect, maintain, use or share student personal information beyond that needed for authorized educational/school purposes, or as authorized by the parent/student.  
    
2. Not sell student personal information.  
    
3. Not use or disclose student information collected through an educational/school service (whether personal information or otherwise) for behavioral targeting of advertisements to students.  
    
4. Not build a personal profile of a student other than for supporting authorized educational/school purposes or as authorized by the parent/student.  
    
5. Not make material changes to school service provider consumer privacy policies without first providing prominent notice to the account holder(s) (i.e., the educational institution/agency, or the parent/student when the information is collected directly from the student with student/parent consent) and allowing them choices before data is used in any manner inconsistent with terms they were initially provided; and not make material changes to other policies or practices governing the use of student personal information that are inconsistent with contractual requirements.  
    
6. Not knowingly retain student personal information beyond the time period required to support the authorized educational/school purposes, or as authorized by the parent/student.  
    
7. Collect, use, share, and retain student personal information only for purposes for which we were authorized by the educational institution/agency, teacher or the parent/student.  
    
8. Disclose clearly in contracts or privacy policies, including in a manner easy for parents to understand, what types of student personal information we collect, if any, and the purposes for which the information we maintain is used or shared with third parties.  
    
9. Support access to and correction of student personally identifiable information by the student or their authorized parent, either by assisting the educational institution in meeting its requirements or directly when the information is collected directly from the student with student/parent consent.  
    
10. Maintain a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of student personal information against risks – such as unauthorized access or use, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure – through the use of administrative, technological, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.  
    
11. Require that our vendors with whom student personal information is shared in order to deliver the educational service, if any, are obligated to implement these same commitments for the given student personal information.  
    
12. Allow a successor entity to maintain the student personal information, in the case of our merger or acquisition by another entity, provided the successor entity is subject to these same commitments for the previously collected student personal information.

SOC 2 Type II Audit
-------------------

A SOC 2 Type II audit provides evidence that a company has a strong commitment to deliver high quality services to its clients by demonstrating they have the necessary internal controls and processes in place.  

ClassLink has successfully completed a SOC 2 Type II audit which was performed by the licensed CPA firm KirkpatrickPrice.  The SOC 2 audit is based on the AICPA's Trust Services Criteria, and focuses on ClassLink's controls as they relate to security, availability, and confidentiality.  A successful SOC 2 audit assures our customers of their reliance on ClassLink's controls to protect their data.

Data Sovereignty
----------------

Nearly all countries have laws that protect personal data privacy. Some countries require that personal data be stored exclusively on servers located in-country. Further, some countries limit the transfer of personal data outside of their jurisdiction.  

ClassLink software and systems are designed to comply with these various regulations as follows:  

* ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data.  
    
* ClassLink software enables the customer to control when and how their data is shared with third party vendors.  
    
* ClassLink customers have the option to host a dedicated ClassLink data server either within their internal data center or utilize a secure data center located within the jurisdiction.  
    
* ClassLink software and system processes can only transmit personal data with the express instruction of the customer.

* Article 5 “Principles relating to processing of personal data”: ClassLink is a trusted steward of personal data. Data received from customers are to be used solely for purposes of providing educational services. Such data will not be sold or used for marketing purposes.  
    
* Article 17 “Right to be forgotten”: Schools can choose to delete users from ClassLink at any time. Individual users can choose to delete any data they’ve added to ClassLink at any time. ClassLink promptly deletes data associated with schools no longer working with ClassLink.  
    
* Article 32 “Security of processing”: ClassLink keeps all personal data confidential and secure. ClassLink team members are bound by contractual non-disclosure agreements. ClassLink’s data security protections include: internal data management policies and procedures, limitations on access to personal data, data encryption (for both data in transit and at rest), data systems monitoring, incident response plans, and safeguards to ensure personal data is not accessed by unauthorized persons when transmitted over communication networks.  
    
* Article 33 “Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority”: GDPR requires notice to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of awareness of a personal data breach. Discovery of a security breach that results in an unauthorized release of personal data: ClassLink shall promptly notify affected customers of such breach, shall conduct an investigation, and shall restore the integrity of its data systems as soon as possible. ClassLink will fully cooperate and assist with required notices to those individuals affected by such breach.  
    
* Article 35: “Data protection impact assessment”: ClassLink conducts various security assessments of our systems. Certain security tests are conducted annually, others more frequently and some other tests are running constantly.  
    
* Article 37: “Designation of a data protection officer”: ClassLink maintains a designated data protection officer who is authorized to engage security reviews and impact product development.  
    
* Article 44: “General principle for transfers”: To promote data sovereignty/data residency in GDPR, the regulation authorizes the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en) to decide if a third country or territory, where data may be transferred, meets adequate levels of protection. As GDPR is new, no third country or territory has yet been approved by the Commission. ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data. Customers located in the EU or UK utilize a secure data center located within the EU zone (Frankfurt, Germany). No servers, outside of these options, are used to store data for EU or UK based customers.

European Union – Privacy Shield
-------------------------------

In July, 2016, the Privacy Shield framework was designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Commission, and the Swiss Administration to help companies comply with data protection requirements of the EU and Switzerland.  

ClassLink participates in the EU Privacy Shield. A list of participating organizations is available at [www.privacyshield.gov/list](http://www.privacyshield.gov/list).  

On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, invalidated the privacy shield as a substitute for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Privacy Shield continues to be in effect for Switzerland. A key factor contributing to the invalidation was the permissible transfer of personal data from the EU to the US under certain circumstances. ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data. ClassLink software and system processes can only transmit personal data with the express instruction of the customer.  

ClassLink continues to participate in Privacy Shield and adhere to its guiding principles for the benefit of our customers in Switzerland.  

ClassLink conforms to the Privacy Shield Principles as follows:  

* Notice: ClassLink publishes online privacy notices, including its participation in the Privacy Shield, its practices on collecting, using, and sharing personal data with third parties, its privacy practices, and choices available to individuals regarding limiting data collection and use.  
    
* Choice: ClassLink will not share the customer’s data with third party vendors. ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data.  
    
* Accountability for Onward Transfer: ClassLink software enables the customer to control when and how their data is shared with third party vendors.  
    
* Security: ClassLink takes all reasonable and appropriate measures to protect the data owned by the customers that it serves from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access.  
    
* Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation: ClassLink takes all reasonable and appropriate measures to limit processing to the purposes for which data has been collected, and to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.  
    
* Access: ClassLink customers are always in control of their data, and can correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate.  
    
* Recourse, Enforcement and Liability: ClassLink protects against the unauthorized access of personal data through a variety of measures, including those enumerated within the EU standard contractual clauses related to data protection.  
    

ClassLink provides contact information on its website for inquiries or complaints regarding compliance with the Privacy Shield. The ClassLink contact web page is [classlink.com/contact](https://www.classlink.com/contact).  

ClassLink participates in the Independent Recourse Mechanism (IRM) provided by the European Union Dispute Resolution Procedures (EU DPAs) for Privacy Shield dispute resolution.  

ClassLink is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission or the appropriate statutory body that will ensure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.
