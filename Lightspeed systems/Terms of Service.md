Any access to or use of the Lightspeed Offering is subject to the terms and conditions in this Terms of Use (“TOU”). Lightspeed may, at its discretion, update the TOU at any time without any prior notice. You can access and review the most current version of the TOU at the URL for this page or by clicking on the “Terms of Use” link within the Lightspeed Offering or as otherwise made available by Lightspeed.

PLEASE REVIEW THE TOU CAREFULLY. BY REGISTERING FOR AN ACCOUNT OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE LIGHTSPEED OFFERING (OR ALLOWING END USERS TO ACCESS OR USE THE LIGHTSPEED OFFERING), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TOU, INCLUDING ANY UPDATES OR REVISIONS POSTED HERE OR OTHERWISE COMMUNICATED TO YOU. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THE TOU ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED AND LAWFULLY ABLE TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THE TOU, IN WHICH CASE THE TERM “YOU” SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TOU, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE LIGHTSPEED OFFERING.

You represent and warrant that you are: (i) over eighteen (18) years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater; (ii) of legal age to form a binding contract; and (iii) not a person barred from using the Lightspeed Offering under the laws of your country of residence or any other applicable jurisdiction.

2. **Other Agreements**

In addition to these TOU, your access to and use of the Lightspeed Offering is subject to the Lightspeed [Privacy Policy](https://www.lightspeedsystems.com/privacy-policy/), any terms agreed to in writing by Lightspeed and you regarding the scope of access to and use of the Lightspeed Offering and/or Lightspeed’s provision of support services to you, and any usage or other policies relating to the Lightspeed Offering posted or otherwise made available to you by Lightspeed (collectively, “Additional Terms”). The Additional Terms are part of the TOU and are hereby incorporated by reference and you agree to be bound by the Additional Terms.

3. **Grant of Rights**

(a) Lightspeed grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and view pages within the Platform.

(b) To the extent that the Platform provides access to any online software, applications or other similar components, Lightspeed grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use such components only in the form within the Platform.

(c) Lightspeed grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to install, run and use the Mobile Apps on a mobile device that you own and control (which term shall include any device owned by you that you lend to end users), in executable, machine-readable, object code form only.

(d) Lightspeed grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to install, run and use the Smart Agents on a device that you own and control (which term shall include any device owned by you that you lend to end users), in executable, machine-readable, object code form only.

(e) All rights granted to you under this TOU are subject to your compliance with the TOU and all Additional Terms in all material respects and may only be exercised by you for your personal, non-commercial use or internal business purposes.

4. **IOS Mobile Apps**

(a) If any Mobile App is downloaded by you from the iTunes App Store (each, an “iOS Mobile App”), the license in Section 3(c) with respect to such iOS Mobile App is further subject to your compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions of the Usage Rules set forth in the iTunes App Store Terms of Service.

(b) With respect to any iOS Mobile App, the parties acknowledge that the TOU is concluded between you and Lightspeed only, and not with Apple Inc. (“Apple”), and Apple is not responsible for iOS Mobile Apps and the contents thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to iOS Mobile Apps. Lightspeed, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims from you or any third party relating to iOS Mobile Apps or your possession and/or use of iOS Mobile Apps, including product liability claims, any claim that iOS Mobile Apps fail to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement and claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of the TOU with respect to iOS Mobile Apps, and Apple shall have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the TOU against you as a third-party beneficiary hereof with respect to iOS Mobile Apps. Lightspeed, not Apple, shall be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any intellectual property infringement claim attributable to iOS Mobile Apps.

5. **Third Party Software**

Some components of the Lightspeed Offering may be provided with or have incorporated into them third-party software (“Third-Party Software”), which may include software licensed under “open source” or other licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative. All Third-Party Software are subject to their own license terms available at [https://help.lightspeedsystems.com/s/article/Third-Party-Software](https://help.lightspeedsystems.com/s/article/Third-Party-Software). If you do not agree to abide by the applicable terms for any Third-Party Software, you should not install or use the applicable components. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Lightspeed has no proprietary interest in any Third Party Software; (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding the rest of the TOU, any Third Party Software is provided “AS IS” with all faults and neither the licensor of such Third-Party Software nor any Lightspeed Party shall be liable for any damages, claims, liabilities or expenses (whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential) related to such Third Party Software or the use thereof; and (iii) such Third-Party Software may be subject to separate license restrictions and obligations set forth in the respective license agreements related to such software.

6. **Support**

Lightspeed will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the support services agreed to by the parties pursuant to the applicable Additional Terms. Otherwise, the TOU does not entitle you to any support for the Lightspeed Offering.

7. **Registration; Account**

In registering for the Lightspeed Offering, you agree to: (i) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Lightspeed Offering’s registration form (the “Registration Data”); and (ii) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Lightspeed reasonably suspects that you have done so, Lightspeed may suspend or terminate your account.

(b) You may not share your account or password with anyone. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not you authorized the particular use or user, and regardless of your knowledge of such use. You agree to notify Lightspeed immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or password or any other similar breach of security.

(c) If your account remains inactive for three months or longer, Lightspeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account, with or without notice to you, and delete Your Content (as defined in Section 8(a)), all without liability to you.

(a) You acknowledge and agree that all information, data, data records, databases, text, software, music, sounds, photographs, images, graphics, videos, messages, scripts, tags and other materials accessible through the Lightspeed Offering, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted (“Content”), are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not Lightspeed, are entirely responsible for all Content that originates from or through you, or that is collected by you or on your behalf, including any Content that you or any of your users upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available through the Lightspeed Offering (collectively, “Your Content”).

(b) You acknowledge and agree that Lightspeed has no obligation to pre-screen Your Content, although Lightspeed reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or remove any of Your Content. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Lightspeed shall have the right to remove (without liability) any of Your Content that violates the TOU or that it deems objectionable.

(c) You represent and warrant that: (i) you have all necessary rights and authority to grant the rights set forth in the TOU with respect to Your Content; and (ii) Your Content does not violate any duty of confidentiality owed to another person, or the copyright, trademark, right of privacy, right of publicity or any other right of any other person.

(d) You shall provide data to Lightspeed in compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to, the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (“PPRA”). You represent, warrant, and covenant to Lightspeed, that you will: (i) comply with all applicable provisions of FERPA relating to disclosures to School Officials (as defined in 34 CFR 99.31 (B)) with a legitimate educational interest, including, without limitation, informing parents in their annual notification of FERPA rights, that you define “school official” to include service providers and define “legitimate educational interest” to include services such as the type provided by Lightspeed; and (ii) provide sufficient notice and disclosure of the terms of this TOU and the Additional Terms to, and obtain and maintain all necessary rights and consents, including consents required by applicable state and federal law, rules, and regulations, such as COPPA, from, either each user or, where necessary, each user’s parent or legal guardian, to allow Lightspeed to provide and improve the Lightspeed Offering and collect and receive user data in accordance with this TOU and the Additional Terms. Lightspeed relies on consent obtained from schools, acting as an agent of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of its students, as permitted by COPPA, for using the Lightspeed Offering in connection with students under thirteen (13) years of age, if any. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to Lightspeed if we request them. We recommend that you provide users and their respective parents/guardians, teacher, and other appropriate school personnel with a copy of Lightspeed’s Privacy Policy and COPPA Notice, and any other parental information made available by Lightspeed.

9. **Notifications and Legal Obligations**

Depending on the Lightspeed Offering services you are using, the Lightspeed Offering may utilize proprietary insight and algorithms to identify warning signs of certain dangerous online behavior. In such cases, you understand that:

(a) Lightspeed may, in its sole discretion, conduct manual review of flagged behavior for further analysis.

(b) If Lightspeed identifies such warning signs, it may trigger an automated communication from Lightspeed to the email address designated in the Lightspeed Offering.

(c) The Lightspeed Offering is not designed to flag all dangerous online behavior and Lightspeed cannot guarantee that the designated email address will be notified of every instance that presents a threat.

(d) You or specific school or district personnel may have a legal obligation to notify law enforcement, first responders, state or federal reporting agencies, such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or other officials (“Government Officials”), or other individuals of the behavior flagged by the Lightspeed Offering. These obligations, like the identified threats, may be time sensitive, and you agree that the designated email address will be monitored on a regular and consistent basis.

(e) You agree that Lightspeed’s notification to the designated email address satisfies any legal obligation imposed on Lightspeed, but Lightspeed may, in its sole discretion, contact Government Officials to notify them of situations that Lightspeed becomes aware and to provide them with information regarding such situations and that such contact may result in such Government Official taking immediate action based on the provided information.

(f) Any notification by Lightspeed to the designated email address, other school or district personnel, law enforcement, or other officials does not satisfy your or the school or district’s legal obligation to notify law enforcement or other officials of the behavior flagged by the Lightspeed Offering.

However, you grant Lightspeed and its service providers a worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid-up, non-exclusive, sublicensable, transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works from, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute, make and have made Your Content (in any form and any medium, whether now known or later developed) as necessary to provide the Lightspeed Offering to you. Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that Lightspeed may collect and use for any lawful purpose Your Content in aggregate form, without identifying individual end users or you.

28. **General Provisions**

The TOU (together with the Additional Terms) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Lightspeed concerning your access to and use of the Lightspeed Offering. It supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral or written negotiations and agreements between you and Lightspeed with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between or among the TOU and any Additional Terms to which the TOU refers, the terms and conditions of the TOU shall take precedence and govern. The TOU may not be amended by you except in a writing executed by you and an authorized representative of Lightspeed. For the purposes of the TOU, the words “such as,” “include,” “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” You may not assign or delegate any right or obligation under the TOU without the prior written consent of Lightspeed. The failure of Lightspeed to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this TOU is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed to the extent necessary to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of the TOU. Any prevention of or delay in performance by Lightspeed hereunder due to labor disputes, acts of god, governmental restrictions, enemy or hostile governmental action, fire or other casualty or other causes beyond its reasonable control shall excuse the performance of its obligations for a period equal to the duration of any such prevention or delay.

**SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS FOR LIGHTSPEED API**  
Lightspeed API is an application programing interface (API), an optional component of the Lightspeed Offering, **that enables electronic sharing of Your Content**. These supplemental terms (the “**Supplemental Terms**“) augment the TOU and apply to use of Lightspeed API. If these Supplemental Terms are inconsistent with any of the other terms of the TOU, then these Supplemental Terms shall control to the extent of the conflict, but only with respect to Lightspeed API.

1. **Authorization and Registration**

If you want to enable electronic sharing of Your Content with a third party via Lightspeed API, then (a) you must complete Lightspeed’s authorization form for the third party, and (b) the third party must register with Lightspeed and accept Lightspeed’s terms governing third-party access to and use of Lightspeed API. If the requirements described in subsections (a) and (b) are satisfied with respect to a third party, then that third party will become your “Authorized Third-Party Recipient” for purposes of these Supplemental Terms. Lightspeed will only enable electronic sharing of Your Content via Lightspeed API with a third party that is your Authorized Third-Party Recipient.

2. **Fees**

Information about the fees for Lightspeed API is available from Lightspeed upon request. You are fully responsible for all Lightspeed API-related fees that are incurred by you or by your Authorized Third-Party Recipients.

3. **Responsibility for Authorized Third-Party Recipients and Your Content**

You are solely and exclusively responsible for your Authorized Third-Party Recipients, including their acts and omissions. You are solely and exclusively responsible for Your Content and the handling of Your Content from and after the initial point of transmission from Lightspeed’s data center to your Authorized Third-Party Recipients via Lightspeed API (including, without limitation, in relation to the confidentiality, security, accuracy, and integrity of Your Content). To avoid any doubt, Section 16 (Indemnification), Section 17 (Disclaimer of Warranties), and Section 18 (Limitation of Liability; Release) of the TOU apply to Lightspeed API and these Supplemental Terms.

4. **Termination for Convenience**

Lightspeed may terminate access to and use of Lightspeed API by you and any one or more of your Authorized Third-Party Recipients for any reason upon fourteen (14) days’ prior written notice to you.
