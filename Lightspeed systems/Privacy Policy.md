#### **4\. Additional Notice for Residents of the UK and European Economic Area  
**

This EU/UK Notice for residents of the UK and European Economic Area is provided in order to satisfy certain obligations that Lightspeed has under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) and UK Data Protection Act 2018 (as amended from time to time) and any relevant transposition of, or successor or replacement to, that regulation (together, the “Data Protection Legislation”).

Under applicable law, Lightspeed is considered the “data controller” of the personal information we handle under this Policy. In other words, we are responsible for deciding how to collect, use and disclose this information, subject to applicable law. Our contact information appears in this Policy.

##### Legal Bases

Data Protection Legislation may require us to explain to you the legal bases for our collection, processing, and use of your personal information. Our legal bases include:

* to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract of employment or other contract with you or performing a contract of employment (e.g., to administer payroll and benefits);
* our legitimate interests (e.g., human resources management; in managing our business operations and information technology resources, such as managing internal directories and improving cybersecurity; in protecting Lightspeed, its employees, customers, and others; dispute resolution; physical security, IT, and network security; workplace safety; and in managing the employment relationship with you, such as performance reviews, training and promotions; internal investigations);
* addressing and complying with legal requirements and obligations (in particular in the area of labor and employment law, social security and social protection law, data protection law, tax law, and corporate compliance laws);
* the protection of vital interest of you or of another individual (e.g., in an emergency medical situation);
* your consent (explicit consent where required), in accordance with local data protection law.

Where the collection of personal information is required to comply with legal or contractual obligations, or to manage the employment relationship, the provision of personal information generally is mandatory. In all other cases, provision of requested personal information is optional; however, failure to provide the information may result in your inability to fully participate in the activity or benefit for which the personal information is requested, such as an optional benefit program. If you have any questions regarding whether provision of personal information is mandatory and the consequences for withholding such data, please contact us using the contact information in this Policy.

The personal information that we collect and process may also contain sensitive data relating to your race or ethnic origin, physical or mental health or condition, trade union membership, commission or alleged commission of criminal offences and any related legal actions. For example, Lightspeed may process health information in accordance with applicable laws, such as information on disabilities for purposes of accommodations in the workplace and for the purpose of arranging employee medical benefits. We only collect and process sensitive data where and to the extent permitted in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

##### Transfer of Personal Information

Your personal information may be transferred to countries which may not have the same or equivalent data protection laws as the European Union. Where required, we make such transfers in compliance with Data Protection Legislation, such as through the use of model contractual clauses (as published by the European Commission).

##### Retention of Personal Information

We may retain personal information for so long as necessary for the purposes described above, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law. To provide security and business continuity for the activities described in this notice, we may make backups of certain data, which we may retain for longer than the original data.

##### Security of Personal Information

We take technical, administrative, physical, and procedural security measures to reduce the risk that personal information in our possession and control will undergo accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access. Please visit our [Trust Page](https://www.lightspeedsystems.com/about/trust/) for more detailed information of our data privacy and security practices.

##### Rights and Choices

Where the Data Protection Legislation applies, you have certain legal rights to request access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal information that we hold about you.

In some cases, you are entitled to receive, in portable form, a copy of the personal information you have provided to us or to request that we transmit it to a third party. You may also object to our processing of your personal information or request certain restrictions on the processing. You may withdraw any consent you have provided for the processing of personal information (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before the request takes effect). All such rights may be exercised by contacting the applicable entity listed below or by contacting Lightspeed as described above, who will handle or route the request as appropriate. These rights are subject to legal exceptions and limitations, which we must consider when addressing the request.

If you have any questions, concerns or complaints relating to our handling of personal information, please contact us as described in this Policy. You may also contact the relevant governmental authority (e.g., the UK Information Commissioner’s Office for UK individuals) with a complaint related to our handling of your personal information. However, we invite you to give us a chance to resolve the situation directly. Your privacy is important to us, and we will do our very best to address your concerns.

#### **5\. U.S. Department of Commerce’s Data Privacy Framework (DPF)**

The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF), were respectively developed in furtherance of transatlantic commerce by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Commission and the UK Government to provide U.S. organizations with reliable mechanisms for personal data transfers to the United States from the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, while ensuring data protection that is consistent with EU and UK laws.

Lightspeed Systems complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Lightspeed Systems has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

Lightspeed Systems is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Lightspeed Systems commits to cooperate and comply respectively with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of human resources data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF in the context of the employment relationship.

**Accountability for Onward Transfer**  
In the event Lightspeed Systems transfers personal data covered by this Policy to a third party acting as a controller, we will do so consistent with any notice provided to Data Subjects, any consent they have given, and only if the third party has given us contractual assurances that it will (i) process the Personal Data for limited and specified purposes consistent with any consent provided by the Data Subjects, (ii) provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles, and notify us if it makes a determination that it cannot do so; and (iii) cease processing of the Personal Data or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate if it makes such a determination. If Lightspeed Systems has knowledge that a third party acting as a controller is processing Personal Data covered by this Policy in a way that is contrary to the Data Privacy Framework Principles, Lightspeed Systems will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing.

Lightspeed Systems remains liable under the Data Privacy Framework Principles if an agent processes Personal Data covered by this Policy in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, except where Lightspeed Systems is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

**Questions/Complaints**  
If you have any questions, concerns or complaints relating to our handling of personal information, please contact us as described in this Policy. You may also contact the relevant governmental authority (e.g., the UK Information Commissioner’s Office for UK individuals and the relevant Data Protection Authorities for EU individuals) with a complaint related to our handling of your personal information. However, we invite you to give us a chance to resolve the situation directly. Your privacy is important to us, and we will do our very best to address your concerns.  
Under certain conditions, an individual may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted, provided that the individual has invoked binding arbitration by delivering notice to Lightspeed Systems, and following the procedures and subject to conditions set forth in [Annex I of the DPF Principles](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf).
