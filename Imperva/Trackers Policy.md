Cookie Notice
=============

Last Updated: March 10, 2021

Introduction
------------

This Cookie Notice provides you with information about cookies and similar technologies that Imperva may place on the device (e.g., computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other electronic device) you use to visit www.imperva.com and its associated sub-domains (e.g., my.imperva.com, community.imperva.com, docs.imperva.com, go.imperva.com, try.imperva.com, etc.) or to access Imperva mobile apps. For simplicity, we’ll refer to such websites and mobile apps as our “Digital Properties.”

* * *

What is a Cookie?
-----------------

Cookies are small data files that a website saves on your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then used by the originating website on each subsequent visit or by another website that recognizes that cookie to develop a record of the user’s online activity.

The function of a cookie can be achieved through the use of other similar technologies. Such technologies include:

**Local Storage.**  Local data storage are small data files that are stored on your device, typically either as “sessionStorage” or “localStorage.”

**Web Beacons.**  Web beacons are small image files, typically a tran

sparent 1×1 pixel image that’s not visible to the human eye that is placed on a website.

**Software Development Kit (SDK).**  SDKs are blocks of code that may be installed in our mobile applications. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile applications and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access the application.

For the purposes of this Cookie Notice, just to keep things simple, we’ll use the term “_**cookies**_” to refer to all of these.

Categories of Cookies Used on Imperva Digital Properties 
---------------------------------------------------------

![Screen Shot 2021 03 09 at 4.54.09 PM](/trust-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-4.54.09-PM.png)     **Essential.**

These cookies are essential for enabling your movement around our websites and mobile apps and providing you with access to features such as your profile and account, customer-only resources, and other secure areas of our websites and mobile apps. They do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes. This category of cookies cannot be disabled.

![datasheet](/trust-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/03/datasheet.png)     **Analytics.**

These cookies help us understand how you interact with our Digital Properties by providing information about the areas you visited, how much time you spent there, and any issues you may have encountered, such as error messages. Using them helps us improve the performance of the Digital Properties.

For example, we use Google Analytics to help us analyze how our Digital Properties are used, including the number of visitors, the websites from which visitors have navigated to our Digital Properties, and the pages on our Digital Properties that our visitors navigate. You can learn about Google’s privacy practices here.

Without these cookies, we can’t learn whether our Digital Properties are working properly or make updates that could, in turn, improve your browsing experience.

![automation](/trust-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/03/automation.png)    **Functional Cookies.**

These cookies allow our Digital Properties to remember the choices you make (such as your username, language or the region you are located in) to provide a more personalized online experience. They can also enable you to watch videos and engage with feedback and social tools, such as blogs, chat tools and forums.

Without these cookies, a website cannot remember the choices you’ve previously made, personalize your browsing experience, or utilize some of the features and functions of the Digital Properties.

![pricing sla](/trust-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/03/pricing_sla.png)     **Marketing Cookies.**

These cookies gather information about your browsing habits and are used to help us understand your interests so we can deliver content that is more relevant to you. For example, they may be used to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement. They also help us measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns on our Digital Properties. We may share this information with other parties, including our advertisers and other service providers.

How Long do our Cookies Remain on Your Device
---------------------------------------------

Cookies are either “session” or “persistent” in nature. Session cookies remain on your device until the end of a browser session, which is typically when you leave our website.

Persistent cookies “persist” beyond the duration of your browser sessions. They remain on your device after you leave our website, typically for periods ranging from one day to two years.

How to Control and Delete Cookies
---------------------------------

### Using Our Cookie Preference Center

You can use Imperva’s Cookie Preference Center to customize your cookie preferences. The Cookie Preference Center not only allows you to set your cookie preferences, it also records when you consent to the use of cookies, and will ask for consent again annually to ensure you stay up to date with changes to our cookie and privacy policies. The Cookie Preference Center specifically controls non-essential cookies set by using our Digital Properties. But remember: essential cookies cannot be disabled, and the Cookie Preference Center cannot be used to block cookies used on third-party websites linked from our Digital Properties.

### Using Your Browser

You can also disable many of the cookies used on our Digital Properties through your browser. To do that follow the instructions located within the “Help,” “Tools” or “Edit” menus in your browser. Please note that disabling a cookie or category of cookies does not delete the cookie from your browser. You still have to do that manually. For directions on how to manage cookies in your browser, please visit the page for the browser you’re using:

Cookies We Set Prior to Opting Out
----------------------------------

If you change your cookie preference to disable certain cookies, the information collected prior to the preference change may still be used; however, we will stop using the disabled cookies to collect any further information. But remember: disabling a cookie or category of cookies does not delete the cookie from your browser. You still have to delete the cookies manually.

Third-party cookies are cookies set by someone other than Imperva for purposes such as collecting information on user behavior, demographics, or personalized marketing. When using our website, you may encounter embedded content, such as YouTube videos, or you may be directed to other websites to participate in a survey or to submit a job application.

We encourage you to review the privacy and cookie notices located on those websites for information about the use of cookies there.
