#### How we may collect your information

**When You Use Our Mobile Apps:** When you use our mobile apps, we may collect certain information from you.

#### What information we collect

**Login Information:** username (e.g., email address), password

**Device and Usage Information:** information regarding your device (e.g., IP address, browser type and settings, and operating system), information regarding how you interact with our mobile apps (e.g., which pages on our mobile apps you view and which content, buttons and features you interact with), network and traffic data relating to your Internet connection, and other information regarding your devices and interactions with our mobile applications.

**Location Data:** information obtained from our service providers to identify which region (e.g., state, province, or country) you may be located in based on the IP address of your device.

#### How we use your information

**Provide and Improve Our Solutions:** We may use your information to provide our Solutions. Such use may include using your username and password to verify your identity and manage access to your account. We may also use Device and Usage Information to improve our mobile apps, such as improving user experience and detecting and fixing bugs. To illustrate, by collecting information regarding which buttons you click on, which pages in the apps you visit and when you visit them, we can detect bugs (such as a button that is supposed to lead you to a new page, but doesn’t) and fix them. Glimpses into page visits can also help us to improve the apps. For instance, if all our users leave a page almost immediately after they enter it, then we can infer that the page may not be as useful or interesting as we were hoping.

Lawful Basis: Legitimate Interests, Contracts

**Information Security:** We may use your information for information security purposes, such as preventing fraud and unauthorized use of our mobile apps, and to otherwise protect the security of our mobile apps and the information that can be accessed through them.

![community](/trust-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/03/community.png) With Whom We Share Your Information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Group Members.** There are many [Imperva Group Members](https://www.imperva.com/trust-center/imperva-group-members), and we all work together and support each other. As such, Imperva Group Members may share your information with each other, and each Imperva Group Member may process your information for the purposes we described in this Statement.

![ebook](/trust-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/03/ebook.png) Lawful Basis for Processing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**(Applicable to EEA & UK Individuals Only)**

We hate to use legalese, but sometimes we just cannot avoid it. Under the GDPR (both the EU and UK versions) there’s the concept of “lawful basis”. It’s a legal term that is meant to describe how a controller (an organization that not only collects your personal information, but why and how it is processed) is legally permitted to process personal information. Is it in furtherance of the controller’s legitimate interests, did the controller obtain your consent, or is there another aspect of the GDPR that permits the controller to process your personal information?

When we process your information as a controller, we primarily rely on legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing your personal Information. However, there may be instances where we rely on another lawful basis. For example, there may also be instances where we ask for your consent to process your personal information. How will you know when we rely on consent as a lawful basis? It’s simple, we’ll ask you for it. For instance, you may check a box indicating that you consent to us sending you emails promoting our Solutions. We may also process your information in order to fulfill our obligations under a contract.

Lastly, there may be instances where, in addition to the lawful bases discussed above, we need to process your information in order to comply with our legal obligations.

![time](/trust-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/03/time.png) Data Retention
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We retain your personal information for a period that we believe to be reasonably necessary for the purposes for which we process such information, unless otherwise required by law. When determining such retention periods, we take into consideration the:

(i) the nature of the information, the purposes for which we process such information, and how long we believe such information may be relevant for such purposes;

(ii) what retention period is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations); and

(iii) our obligations under the various agreements we enter into and under applicable law.

![apps api](/trust-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/03/apps_api.png) Security of Your Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In furtherance of our commitment to respecting your privacy rights, we maintain technical and organizational safeguards that are designed to help protect the security of your personal information. Such safeguards include both technical safeguards (e.g., web-application firewalls, access controls, and network monitoring) and organizational safeguards (e.g., conducting employee training and awareness programs, entering into data protection agreements with relevant service providers, and controlling access to our facilities ). For other examples of such measures, click [here](https://www.imperva.com/trust-center/security/).

![dns](/trust-center/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/03/dns.png) International Transfers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imperva is a global organization. Although we maintain our headquarters in the United States, we have a vast, global presence, which includes the use of service providers and business partners from all over the world. That means your personal data may be transferred to the United States and other countries which may not have a similar standard of for data protection as your local data protection laws. Whenever we transfer personal information to other jurisdictions, we will endeavor to mitigate the risks associated with the transfer through the use of technical and organizational safeguards. Such measures may include the use of the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses when transferring personal information from the European Union among Imperva’s Group Members or to our service providers.
