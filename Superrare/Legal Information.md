All information stored on the blockchain is then also stored by the Company in separate servers in order to reproduce that information in a manner that is user friendly. SuperRare Labs has no ability to modify or destroy any information on the blockchain. Some information may be superficially concealed from the Site in order to comply with lawful requests, but the data itself is irrevocably and permanently on chain. To see what information is stored on the blockchain, go to [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) input your or another person’s public Ethereum address into the search. See Section 3 for more information.
