About Perfect Privacy
---------------------

### Perfect Privacy

Perfect Privacy is an initiative of private and independent individuals from different parts of the globe, dedicated to protect your privacy and anonymity online. Our services are fully compliant with the law. We do not monitor, review, log or store your communication/connection data.

### What we do

We encrypt and anonymize your Internet connection. We offer several different [VPN services and proxies](https://www.perfect-privacy.com/en/features/vpn-protocols) for you to choose from. Our services use safe and reliable industry standards, and can be used with almost any current operating system and client software/application.

### Privacy Policy

We try to store as little data as possible, as we can’t be forced to give away something we don’t have in the first place.

Data we need to store:

* Your login credentials (username and password)
* The email address you provide
* The expiration date of your account

We do not log any logins or connections you make. We solely record the total usage ratio of the servers, i.e. how much traffic is being used on our servers. This data can be publicly viewed on our [server status page](https://www.perfect-privacy.com/en/serverstatus "Server status page") .

We use Google Analytics to be able to effectively control ad serving and to continuously improve and expand the content of our pages. The IP address is anonymized (anonymizeIp) in the process. [Information how Google uses data](https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/partners/) and opt-out.

Further information on data protection can be found in our [privacy policy](https://www.perfect-privacy.com/en/privacy-policy).
