Your compliance with these Terms of Service is a condition to your access to and use of the Platform and

Service. Please read these Terms of Service carefully before accessing or using the Platform or using any

accessing or using the Platform or using any Service (or any portion, aspect or feature of the Platform or

the Service), at any time in its sole discretion, with or without notice. These Terms of Service are a binding

contract between you and us.

In addition to these Terms of Service, you may enter into other agreements with us or others that will govern

your use of the Service or related services offered by us or others. If there is any contradiction between these

Terms of Service and another agreement you enter into applicable to specific aspects of the Service, the

other agreement shall take precedence in relation to the specific aspects of the Service to which it applies.

Terms of Service on the Platform and will indicate the date the Terms of Service were last revised. You

understand and agree that your continued use of the Service or the Platform after we have made any such

changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. Except for changes made by us as set

forth herein, no other amendment or modification of these Terms of Service will be effective unless in writing

and signed by both you and us.

8. User Information and Data; Account Security



A. User Data. In consideration of your access and use of the Platform and the Service, including the

Brokerage Service, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about you as may

be required by the Platform or the Service, including any registration or investment forms, questionnaires

on the Platform, and the creation of User credentials, including User name, password, and any other

identifiers or authentication information (“User Data”). User Data may include certain personal

information, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, taxpayer

identification number, government identification number, and scans of government-issued identity

documents. In addition to providing this information, to facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements

for data retention, you agree to permit us to keep a record of all such User Data for the entire duration of

your registration with the Platform plus six (6) years beyond the termination of your registration with the

Platform. You acknowledge and agree you are fully and solely responsible for all use of your User Data,

or the access and use of the Platform or Service using our User Data, and for any actions that take place

using your User Data.



B. Data and Information Security. You are responsible for the confidentiality, security, and use of User Data.

You will safeguard and take steps to prohibit any others from using your User Data. Use of User Data to

take any action on the Platform or in connection with the Service, will constitute conclusive evidence that

6



we may treat such action as authorized. You are responsible for all transactions entered using your

credentials. We are not liable for loss or damages caused by any third-party using your User Data. Unless

we agree in writing executed by our Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel, you will not permit any

third-party to use or access your User Data, including to access or take any action on the Platform or in

connection with the Service. Furthermore, you agree to the following: (i) you will provide immediate notice

to us of any theft or loss in connection with the Platform, Service, or your User Data; (ii) you will provide

immediate notice to us of any unauthorized access to or use of your User Data, or any unauthorized

access to the Platform using your User Data; (iii) any unauthorized access to the Platform or any other

breach of security; and (iv) that you will exit and log out from the Platform at the end of each session

when accessing the Platform or any Service.



C. Updating User Data. You shall maintain and keep accurate, current, and complete all information you

provide to us, including all User Data, and promptly update any changes to any such information or User

Data you have provided. If there is any reasonable doubt that any information provided by you is wrong,

untruthful, outdated, or incomplete, we may send you a notice to request corrections, remove relevant

information directly and, as the case may be, terminate all or part of your access to and use of the Platform

and the Service provided to you. Additionally, your failure to provide or keep updated any such

information, or to authorize any such inquiries, may cause us to immediately discontinue your access to

and use of the Platform and Service by preventing your access to the same.



D. Inquiries. During the investment process as part of the Brokerage Service, and prior to any User being

permitted to invest in any securities, we will require that you provide information necessary to, among

other things: verify a User’s status as an Accredited Investor as defined under the securities laws; conduct

satisfactory background information screening; perform identity verification; and screen for the detection

of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime. Additionally, you authorize us

to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to verify your

identity or protect you and/or us against fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial

crime, and to take any action we deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries. When we carry

out these inquiries, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be disclosed to

identity verification, compliance data recordation, credit reference, fraud prevention, or financial crime

agencies and that these agencies may respond to our inquiries in full. Additionally, your failure to

authorize any such inquires will be cause for us to immediately discontinue your access to and use of the

Platform and/or Service and/or restrict your access to and use of the Platform and/or Service.



E. Take Precautionary Measures. You can take several precautions to protect the security of your computer

and personal User Data. For instance, you can use a well-chosen password and restrict access to your

email account. You can also install and regularly update antivirus and firewall software to protect your

computer from external attacks by malicious users. As agreed to herein, when you are finished with a

session on the Platform, be sure that you log out and close the browser window. You should also be

aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access to your User Data and account information through

“phishing,” whereby scammers try to bring unsuspecting people to a website by using a genuine-looking

email purporting to be from a legitimate company. Sometimes, either in the email itself or on this fake

site, scammers will ask for login information to gain access to people’s accounts and withdraw their

money. We will never send you an email asking you for your login information. In general, you can protect

yourself against phishing by never providing personal or login information via a link contained in an email;

instead, go to the website directly. You might also make it a habit to check the URL of a website to be

7



sure that it begins with the correct domain. In the case of RealtyMogul, you should always ensure the

URL begins with https://realtymogul.com or https://www.realtymogul.com.



9. User Content



The Service may allow you and other Users to submit, post, transmit and share content with other Users.

You are solely responsible for any such content (which may include photos, profiles, messages, notes, text,

information (including personal information, credit data and other financial information), music, video, contact

information for you or others, advertisements or other content) that you upload, publish, provide or display

(hereinafter, “post”) on or through the Service or the Platform, or transmit to or share with other Users

(collectively, the “User Content”). It is against these Terms of Service to contact third parties directly or to

attempt to enter into any transactions with third parties outside of the Service where such third party had

been introduced to you through the Service. We may, but are not obligated to, review and delete or remove

(without notice) any User Content in our sole discretion, including User Content that in our sole judgment

violates these Terms of Service, or otherwise might be offensive or illegal, or might violate the rights of, harm,

or threaten the safety of, others, as determined by us in our sole discretion.



By posting User Content to any part of the Platform, you thereby grant, and you represent and warrant that

you have the right to grant, to us an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide

license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate,

excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such User Content for any purpose on or in connection with the

Platform or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such User

Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of any or all of the foregoing. If you choose to remove your

User Content, the license granted above will not expire.



The Company may preserve User Content and may also disclose User Content if required to do so by law

or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with

legal process, applicable laws or government requests; (b) enforce these Terms of Service; (c) respond to

claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; and/or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal

safety of the Company, Users, and the public. The technical processing and transmission of the Service,

including User Content, may involve transmissions over various networks, and changes to conform and adapt

to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.



10. Proprietary Rights in Platform Content



All content on the Platform, including designs, text, graphics, pictures, video, information, software, music,

sound and other files, and their selection and arrangement (the “Platform Content”), is our sole and

exclusive property with all rights reserved. No Platform Content may be modified, copied, distributed, framed,

reproduced, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted, transmitted, or sold in any form or by any means,

in whole or in part, without our prior written permission. You may not republish any of the Platform Content

on any internet, intranet, or extranet site, or otherwise incorporate any of the Platform Content in any other

database or compilation, and any other use of the Platform Content is strictly prohibited. Any use of the

Platform or the Platform Content other than as specifically authorized herein, without our prior written

permission is strictly prohibited and will terminate the rights granted herein. We reserve all rights not granted

herein are reserved. Such unauthorized use may also violate applicable laws including copyright and

trademark laws and applicable communications regulations and statutes. Unless explicitly stated herein,

8



nothing in these Terms of Service shall be construed as conferring any license to intellectual property rights,

whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise. The access and use rights granted herein may be terminated

by us at any time without notice and with or without cause.



11. Linked Sites



The Platform may contain links to third-party websites (“Linked Sites”). These links are provided only as a

convenience. The inclusion of any link is not, and shall not be construed to imply, an affiliation, sponsorship,

endorsement, approval, investigation, verification or monitoring by RealtyMogul of any information, materials,

products, or services contained in or accessible through any Linked Site. In no event shall RealtyMogul be

responsible for the information contained on any Linked Site or your use of or inability to use any Linked Site.

Access and use of Linked Sites, including the information, material, products, and services on Linked Sites

or available through Linked Sites, is solely at your own risk. Your access and use of the Linked Sites is

governed by the terms of use and privacy policies of such Linked Sites, and we encourage you to carefully

review all such terms and policies.



12. Copyright Complaints



If you believe that any material on the Platform infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, you

may send a written notification of such infringement to our Designated Agent as set forth below:



Name of Agent Designated to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement:

Attn: General Counsel

Full Address of Designated Agent to Which Notification should be Sent:

Telephone Number of Designated Agent:

To meet the notice requirements under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the notification must

be a written communication that includes the following: (i) the signature of the copyright owner or an

authorized agent; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple

works are on a single site, a representative list of such works; (iii) identification of the infringing material or

activity (or the reference or link to such material) and information reasonably sufficient to permit the OSP to

locate the material (or the reference or link); (iv) contact information for the copyright owner or authorized

agent; (v) a statement that the person sending the notice has a good faith belief that use of the material in

the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement

that the information in the notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the person sending the notice

is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.



In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating, in

appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, the registrations of Users who are deemed to be repeat

infringers. We may also, at our sole discretion, limit access to the Platform and/or terminate the registrations

of any Users who infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property rights of others, whether there

is any repeat infringement, misappropriation, or violation.



13. Consent to Electronic Transactions and Disclosures

9



Because RealtyMogul operates largely on the Internet, it is necessary for you to consent to transact business

with us online and electronically. Before you decide to do business electronically with RealtyMogul, you

acknowledge and agree to these Terms of Service and to our E-Sign and Electronic Delivery Consent. You

also acknowledge and agree that you satisfy the following computer hardware and software requirements:

access to the Internet; an email account and related software capable of receiving email through the Internet;

a web browser which is SSL-compliant and supports secure sessions, such as Internet Explorer 5.0 or above

and Netscape Navigator 6.0 or above, or the equivalent software; and hardware capable of running this

software. RealtyMogul generally receives all payments, and makes all disbursements, through electronic

funds transfers (ACH transfers) using the bank (or other financial institution) account information you provide

to us. You authorize such bank or other financial account to pay any amounts described herein and authorize

RealtyMogul to make any and all investment disbursements to such account. You must provide RealtyMogul

with updated information regarding your bank or other account upon RealtyMogul’s request and at any time

that the information earlier provided is no longer valid.



The decision to do business with RealtyMogul electronically is yours. Your consent to receive disclosures

and transact business electronically, and our agreements to do so, applies to the Service and any

transactions to which such disclosures relate. Your consent will remain in effect for so long as you are a User

and, if you are no longer a User, will continue until such a time as all disclosures relevant to transactions that

occurred while you were a User have been made. You may not withdraw such consent if you have any

outstanding or active investments made through the Platform. If you have no outstanding investments made

through the Platform and wish to withdraw consent to doing business electronically, we will terminate your

registered user account with us.



You also expressly consent to receiving calls and messages, including auto-dialed and pre-recorded

message calls, and SMS messages (including text messages) from us, our affiliates, marketing partners,

agents and others calling at their request or on their behalf, at any telephone numbers that you have provided

or may provide in the future (including any cellular telephone numbers). Your cellular or mobile telephone

provider will charge you according to the type of plan you carry. If you are accessing the Platform and the

disclosures electronically via a mobile device (such as a smart phone, tablet, and the like), in addition to the

above requirements you must have software on your mobile device that allows you to print and save the

disclosures presented to you in connection with the Service. These applications can be found for most mobile

devices in the device’s respective “app store”. If you do not have these capabilities on your mobile device,

you should access the Site through a device that provides these capabilities.



14. Updates



You must keep us informed of any change in your e-mail address, your home mailing address, or your

telephone number so that we can maintain communications with you about your authorization as a registered

User and so that you can continue to receive all necessary disclosures in a timely fashion. You can contact

us by e-mail at info@realtymogul.com or by calling us at 310-907-7129\. You may also reach us in writing to

us at the following address: Realty Mogul, Co., #603, 10573 W Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90064.

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation,

to monitor disputes between you and other Users.



16. Privacy



You acknowledge and agree to the Platform’s Privacy Policy. By accessing or using the Platform or the

Service, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.

TO YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA, OR ANY DIRECT,

INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES

ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM OR THE SERVICE OR ANY OF THE PLATFORM

HEREIN, EXCEPT AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OR OTHER LAWS,

YOU SHALL BE LIMITED TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY, AND SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO DAMAGES

You shall indemnify and hold RealtyMogul harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand,

damage, cost and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in connection with your

access and use of the Platform and/or Service, your conduct in connection with the Platform and/or Service

or with other Users of the Platform and/or Service, or any violation of these Terms of Service or of any law

or the rights of any third-party, any of your User Content, including any third-party content, you post or share

on or through the Platform. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542,

which reads: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or

suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have

materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive

any comparable statute or doctrine.



18. Governing Law; Mandatory Arbitration; Attorney’s Fees



A. Governing Law. By visiting or accessing or using the Platform and/or Service, you agree that the laws of

the State of Delaware, without regard to any principles of conflict of laws that would require or permit the

application of the laws of any other jurisdiction, will govern these Terms of Service. By agreeing to the

Terms of Service and using the Platform and the Service, you submit to personal jurisdiction in

Delaware for all purposes, and you hereby waive, to maximum extent permitted by law, any right

to a trial by jury for any matter.



B. Mandatory Arbitration: Any controversy, dispute, claim, or grievance between us on the one hand, and

you or, if applicable, your shareholders, officers, directors, employees, associates, or agents on the other

hand, arising out of, or relating to these Terms of Service, the Platform and/or the Service, shall be

resolved by binding arbitration, in accordance with the rules then prevailing of any one of the following:

JAMS (pursuant to JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures), the Financial Industry

Regulatory Authority, the arbitration forum of any exchange of which the Company is a member, or such

arbitration body as required by law, rule, or regulation. The award of the arbitrator shall be final, and

judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court, state or federal, having jurisdiction. Any

arbitration will be conducted in the English language before a single arbitrator in Delaware. Such

arbitration must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either RealtyMogul or you may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction

for injunctive relief without breach of this arbitration provision. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree

to the following:



a. ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE OR RELATE TO

THE PLATFORM AND/OR THE SERVICE IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND

DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, USER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY

WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL

ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, THE PLATFORM

AND/OR THE SERVICE.

b. USER IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE THE COMPANY IN COURT, INCLUDING THE

RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY THE RULES OF THE

ARBITRATION FORUM IN WHICH A CLAIM IS FILED.

c. ARBITRATION AWARDS ARE GENERALLY FINAL AND BINDING; A USER’S ABILITY TO

HAVE A COURT REVERSE OR MODIFY AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS VERY LIMITED.

13



d. THE ABILITY OF A USER TO OBTAIN DOCUMENTS, WITNESS STATEMENTS, AND OTHER

DISCOVERY IS GENERALLY MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT

PROCEEDINGS.

e. THE ARBITRATOR DOES NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE REASON(S) FOR THEIR AWARD

UNLESS, IN AN ELIGIBLE CASE, A JOINT REQUEST FOR AN EXPLAINED DECISION HAS

BEEN SUBMITTED BY ALL PARTIES TO THE PANEL AT LEAST 20 DAYS PRIOR TO THE

FIRST SCHEDULED HEARING DATE.

f. THE RULES OF SOME ARBITRATION FORUMS MAY IMPOSE TIME LIMITS FOR BRINGING

A CLAIM IN ARBITRATION. IN SOME CASES, A CLAIM THAT IS INELIGIBLE FOR

ARBITRATION MAY BE BROUGHT IN COURT.

g. THE RULES OF THE ARBITRATION FORUM IN WHICH THE CLAIM IS FILED, AND ANY

AMENDMENTS THERETO, SHALL BE INCORPORATED INTO THIS AGREEMENT.



C. Attorneys’ Fees. In all instances, including arbitration, mediation, litigation, inquiry or any other matter or

proceeding between or regarding you and us, including the Platform, Service, or these Terms of Service,

you: (i) must bear your own legal costs, including attorneys’ fees; and (ii) waive any right to recover from

us any such costs or fees, including attorneys’ fees incurred to the extent permissible under applicable

law. You shall indemnify us for any costs or fees, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in defending

ourselves against any attempt by you to recover attorneys’ fees in violation of this provision.



19. Notifications and Communications from the Platform



RealtyMogul will send you email notifications from time to time. Some notifications are required elements of

your transactions on Platform, such as confirmations of actions you have taken. These mandatory notices

are sent typically to notify you of a change in status. For example, you will receive a notice when you are

confirmed as an investor. We also send out notices that are required for legal or security purposes. For

example, certain notifications are sent for your own protection to ensure that another person cannot make a

change to your User account without your knowledge. In other cases, these notifications involve changes to

various legal agreements or Site policies. Generally, you may not opt out of such service-related emails.

When you register as a User, you will receive emails that confirm specific actions you requested. These will

include emails to which you must respond to complete your registration and notifications confirming your

registration. Additionally, RM Securities will send you emails concerning new Limited Products available on

our Platform, as well as updates concerning the progress of the funding of such Limited Products and/or

other relevant information. If you make an investment in a Limited Product through the Site, RM Securities

will also send you confirmations of the investment as well as occasional updates as to the status of that

investment and the timing of distributions relating to that investment.



When you register as a User and opt-in to RealtyMogul’s SMS Communications program, you are consenting

to receive text messages sent by an automatic telephone dialing system and acknowledge that data usage

charges may apply by your cell phone company. You may receive text messages regarding system

notifications, RM Securities’ Limited Product updates, special offers and promotions, and can manage your

opt-in status in your user profile.



We may also send you responses to emails you send us, if appropriate. From time to time, we will also send

user surveys, requests for user feedback regarding user experience and Site operations, or marketing offers

from us or from us on behalf of our marketing partners. Completing these surveys, answering requests for

14



feedback, or accepting any offer is strictly voluntary. If you do not wish to receive these surveys, user

feedback emails, and/or marketing offers, please opt out in any offer email you receive from us.



20. No Waiver of Certain Securities Matters



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Service, in no event shall anything in these Terms

of Service be deemed to be a waiver, and we will not assert there has been a waiver, that would be

permissible under Section 14 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 29(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of

1934, or any other applicable provision of federal and state securities laws.



21. Submissions



You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other

information about the Platform or the Service (“Submissions”), provided by you to us are non-confidential

and shall become our sole property, and you hereby assign to us all rights in and to such Submissions. We

shall own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted

use and dissemination of these Submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without

acknowledgement or compensation to you.



22. Other



Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver

of such right or provision in that or any other instance. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to

be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, such provision will be construed to be limited to only the

duration, scope and activity that is determined to be valid and enforceable under such law and the remainder

of these Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect.
