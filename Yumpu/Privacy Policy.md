You can find more information about cookies in our cookie policy ([https://www.yumpu.com/en/info/cookie\_policy](https://www.yumpu.com/en/info/cookie_policy)).
2. Log-files
    ---------

    1. Geolocalization  
        In order to provide you with special services (e.g. automatic pre-selection of your country-specific VAT), this website uses a geolocalization software developed by MaxMind, Inc. (14 Spring Street, 3rd Floor, Waltham, MA 02451, USA). This software analyzes IP addresses to determine your approximate location. Geolocalization is carried out exclusively on the basis of anonymous IP addresses. An exact location determination of the website visitor is hereby excluded. Please also note MaxMind’s privacy policy, which you can access here: [https://www.maxmind.com/en/privacy\_policy](https://www.maxmind.com/en/privacy_policy)
    2. Links  
        Our offer contains links to other websites. As a provider we are responsible for our own content according to the general laws. We do not assume any responsibility for third-party content that is made available for use, recognizably via links, and do not adopt its content as our own. We have no influence on whether the operators of other websites comply with data protection regulations.
3. Website analytics
    -----------------
    
    1. Google Analytics
        1. This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, Ca 94043, USA). The use shall be made on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f. GDPR. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website, such as browser type / version, operating system used, referrer URL (the previously visited page), host name of the accessing computer (IP address), time of the server request, is usually transferred to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. We have also added the code “anonymizeIP” to Google Analytics on this website. This guarantees the masking of your IP address so that all data is collected anonymously. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
            1. We have enhanced the IP address masking ("anonymizeIP") feature on this website for both, our Google Analytics and Google Analytics integration, into your Yumpu Analytics account.
            2. IP address anonymization has been developed by Google to enable this website to comply with applicable data protection laws and the recommendations of local data protection authorities when they prohibit the storage of the full IP address. If you use Google Analyitcs for your magazines or your account, anonymous data will also be transmitted to you. IP anonymization or masking takes place as soon as the IP addresses arrive in the Google Analytics data collection network and before the data is stored or processed. More information on IP anonymization can be found at [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) .  
                Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide us with other services relating to website activity and internet usage. You can prevent the storage of cookies by making the appropriate setting in your browser. We would like to point out, that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this website to their full extent.  
                You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including IP address) and from processing this data by Google. Download the following browser plug-in and install it ([http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)). As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can prevent Google Analytics from capturing data (see 3.1.3).  
                Further information on data protection in connection with Google Analytics can be found in the Google Analytics help ([https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en)).
        2. Google Analytics reports on demographic characteristics and interests: We’ve turned on advertising reporting in Google Analytics. The reports on demographic characteristics and interests include information on age, gender and interest. This enables us, to get a better picture of our users without assigning this data to individual persons. You can find out more about the advertising functions at [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=en).  
            You can opt-out of using the activities and information in your Google Account by checking the box under Advertising preferences on [https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated)
        3. Google Analytics deactivation link: You can prevent Google from collecting further visits to this website. Attention: The deletion of cookies, the use of the incognito / private mode of your browser, or the use of another browser leads to data being collected again. [Disable Google Analytics](javascript:gaOptout()). Deactivate Google Analytics. An opt-out cookie is set to prevent your data from being collected in the future when you visit this website. The opt-out cookie is only valid in this browser and only for our website and is stored on your device.

    4. Trustpilot  
        Your opinion is valuable to us. Your feedback plays a crucial role in our continuous improvement process. Customer reviews are particularly fruitful for us. For this reason, we offer you the opportunity to rate our service or our company via a rating service provided by Trustpilot at www.trustpilot.de. We use an interface to the independent rating portal Trustpilot, which is operated by Trustpilot A/S (Pilestraede 58, 5, 112 Copenhaben, Denmark). It is not possible for us to individually control or influence evaluation invitations. Only in this way a complete, independent and uninfluenceable customer evaluation for our company and our services can be guaranteed.

If you no longer wish to receive invitations from Trustpilot in the future, you can unsubscribe directly in the e-mail or revoke them by contacting the rating platform. Please note that this applies to all review invitations from all merchants using Trustpilot’s invitation service. If a rating is submitted by clicking on the link contained in the invitation e-mail, a user profile is automatically created at Trustpilot. This implies your acceptance of Trustpilot’s Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. These can be viewed on the Trustpilot website at [https://uk.legal.trustpilot.com/end-user-privacy-terms](https://uk.legal.trustpilot.com/end-user-privacy-terms) and [https://uk.legal.trustpilot.com/end-user-terms-and-conditions](https://uk.legal.trustpilot.com/end-user-terms-and-conditions) respectively.

5. Advertising
    -----------
    
    1. Google Tag Manager (GTM)  
        GTM is a solution that allows marketers to manage website tags through a single interface. The tool Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags) is a domain without cookies. The tool triggers other tags that may themselves collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, it will persist for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager. The IP address provided by your browser as part of Google Tag Manager will not be merged with any other data held by Google. We have also set Google Tag Manager to transmit your data anonymously to Google for this website. This guarantees the masking of your IP address so that all data is collected anonymously. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.
    2. Google AdSense (Google AdSense is not currently in use. We reserve the right to use Google AdSense in the future).

You can read which data is collected by Google and for what purpose this data is used at [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)_
    3. Use of Google DoubleClick for Publishers  
        This website uses the DoubleClick for Publishers ("DoubleClick"), a service of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, Ca 94043, USA). DoubleClick is a platform for the placement, control and optimization of advertisements on websites. With the help of DoubleClick, we can reach website visitors who have previously been interested in certain content areas by analyzing the use of our website, as well on other pages of our website or on other websites within the Google display network (on Google itself, so-called “Google ads” or on other websites) and present advertisements based on their interests. For this, Google uses so-called DoubleClick-Cookies, which are stored on your computer. DoubleClick cookies do not contain or store any personal user data.
        1. How to disable cookies can be found in our cookie policy at [https://www.yumpu.com/en/info/cookie\_policy](https://www.yumpu.com/en/info/cookie_policy).

        2. You can deactivate interest-related ads from Google in your browser by clicking on the “deactivate” link in the “Deactivation settings” section of [http://www.google.de/settings/ads](http://www.google.de/settings/ads) or (if you use Google Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer) by deactivating the DoubleClick cookie for your browser by installing the extension offered on [http://www.google.de/settings/ads](http://www.google.de/settings/ads).
    4. Use of Google AdWords (Remarketing / Conversion Tracking)  
        Our website uses the Google AdWords service. Google AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain view, CA 94043, USA).
        1. We use the remarketing function within the Google AdWords service. With the remarketing function, we can present users our website on other websites within the Google display network (on Google itself, so-called Google ads or on other websites) ads, based on their interests. For this purpose, the interaction of the users on our website is analysed, e.g. which offers the user is interested in, in order to be able to display targeted advertising to the users on other pages, even after visiting our website. To do this, Google stores a number in the browsers of users who visit certain Google services or websites on the Google display network. The visits of these users are recorded via this number (cookie).

Here you can find the AdvertServe Privacy Shield ([https://privacy.advertserve.com/](https://privacy.advertserve.com/)). This website provides users with information about the program along with an easy-to-understand privacy policy and option to contact AdvertServe with any questions. It also provides these users with a way to manage their privacy settings:
            
            * Opt-in or opt-out of data collection
            * View all of the data that has been collected about you
            * Change your dates
            * Download your data in a machine-readable format
            * Delete your data if you want to be forgotten
            
              
            AdvertServe has taken steps to protect personal data in the backend system, e.g. hashing or masking sensitive data fields in system logs. By keeping statistical data only in aggregated form, it protects the privacy of individuals, since aggregated statistical data cannot be traced back to a specific person. Information that is collected is the gender, age, income range and interests of the users.
        2. Data Collect
            1. Internet Protocol Address  
                AdvertServe uses IP geo-location technology to translate your IP address into an approximate geographic location that may include your continent, country, state/province, city, zip/postal code, designated marketing area, time zone, ISP and current weather data. This technology is anonymous and primarily based upon publicly available IP registration data.
            2. Mobile Advertising ID AdvertServe does not utilize mobile Advertising IDs (AAID/IDFA) at this time. Both Android and iOS provide options for limiting and opt-ing out of such tracking though ([https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en)). Android users can Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads and iOS users can enable Limit Ad Tracking if desired ([https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223)).
            3. Referrer URL  
                AdvertServe is able to determine which web site you are viewing by inspecting the HTTP referrer header sent by your browser so that just relevant advertisements is shown, that are based on its subject matter. The textual content of these web sites is indexed and perform keyword targeting to further improve the relevancy of advertisements is set. However, this is strictly NOT performed on pages which are dynamically generated (i.e. with a query string) or for any pages that exist behind a user-login form so that avoid extracting any information that may personally identify you.
            4. User-Agent  
                AdvertServe uses the information in the Accept-Language and User-Agent HTTP headers sent by your browser to identify your device type (i.e. Desktop, Tablet or Mobile) as well as your operating system, web browser and language preferences. This enables us to show you advertisements that are suitable for your device and written in your language.
        3. Deactivation
