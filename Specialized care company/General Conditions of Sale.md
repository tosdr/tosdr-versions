Return Policy
=============

### Specialized Care Co Inc. Returns Policy

#### What Can Be Returned

You may return any merchandise (excluding downloadable products) in original condition within 30 days of receiving it for a full product refund. You may return any item due to defective materials or workmanship (normal wear & tear excepted) for up to 6 months from the date of receiving it for a full refund. Other requests will be on a case-by-case basis. 

#### How To Return An Item

In order to return or exchange an item, you must obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA).

[E-mail us](https://specializedcare-com.myshopify.com/pages/contact-us "Contact") to obtain an RMA.    
  
Once you receive your RMA, please pack the item with appropriate packing and taping, and include the following with your return:  
  
The RMA number  
The name and address on the original order  
A phone number where we can reach you  
Your e-mail address  
The reason for returning the merchandise  
Whether you want a refund or replacement merchandise  
  
**How to Ship Your Return**  
We suggest that you use a method of shipment that allows for tracking and/or delivery confirmation. Any package that has not been received by Specialized Care Co Inc. and for which tracking information cannot be provided will be the responsibility of the shipper. If it is more convenient for you, we can provide a return label for your use. The cost of this label may be deducted from your refund, depending on the reason for the return (more information below).  
  
**Where to return an item:**  
Specialized Care Co Inc.  
Returns Department  
24 Stickney Terr Ste 2  
Hampton, NH 03842-4902  
  
**Who Pays for the Shipping of a Return**  
If the issue with the merchandise is a fault of ours (example: wrong item shipped), we will pay for all shipping charges. If the reason is something that you control (changed your mind, ordered the wrong item by mistake, etc.), we will refund the cost of the product, but you will be responsible for the shipping charges.

There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted (if applicable)  
Products with obvious signs of use  
  
• Any item not in its original condition, is damaged or missing parts for reasons not due to our error

• CD, DVD, or software that has been opened  
  
**Refunds (if applicable)**  
Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.  
If you are approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within 5 business days.  
Digital or downloadable products are non-refundable.  
  
**Late or missing refunds (if applicable)**  
If you haven’t received an expected refund, please check your bank account and/or your credit card company - there is often processing time before a refund is posted.  
If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund, please [contact us.](https://specializedcare-com.myshopify.com/pages/contact-us "Contact")
