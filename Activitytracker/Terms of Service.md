Please consider that the Licensed Applications and/or the Services are licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms of this EULA, unless the same are accompanied by a different license agreement, in which case the terms of that different license agreement will govern the relationship between You and the Application Provider, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement.

Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Bits&Coffee and its licensors, if any.

If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by Bits&Coffee that replace and/or supplement the Licensed Applications, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license shall prevail over this EULA.
