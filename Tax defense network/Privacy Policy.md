Arrow pointing down to indicate more content

Tax Defense Network (‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) is committed to keeping any and all personal information collected of those individuals who visit taxdefensenetwork.com (‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù) and make use of our online facilities and services accurate, confidential, secure, and private. Our privacy policy has been designated and created to ensure those using our website are informed of our commitment to meet existing privacy standards.

THEREFORE, this Privacy Policy Agreement shall apply to Website and shall govern any and all data collection and usage thereof. Through the use of the Website, you are consenting to the following data and privacy procedures expressed within this agreement.

Collection of Information
-------------------------

The Company collects information about you in three ways_:_¬†(1) directly from you, (2) from our web server logs, and (3) through cookies. We primarily use the information to provide a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. **We DO NOT share any information you provide with others** unless we are required to do so by law.

_User-supplied information:_¬†If you fill out the contact form on this website, we will ask you to provide some personal information, including name, phone, and email. If chat is available through the Website, you may be asked to provide information while participating in an online chat. Please do not submit any confidential, proprietary, or sensitive personally identifiable information. This includes Social Security numbers, driver‚Äôs license numbers, or other financial account information (sensitive information). If you submit any sensitive information, you do so at your own risk, and the Company will not be liable to you or responsible for the consequences of your submission.

The Company uses ActiveProspect‚Äôs TrustedForm Script to independently document your consent to be contacted. The TrustedForm Script is embedded on our website and collects the following information when you interact with the page(s) where the script is present: page URL, mouse movements and clicks, contact information inputted by you, a snapshot of the page, including IP address of your computer, time on the page, date and time that the TrustedForm Script was loaded, as well as the date and time of your interactions with the page, and HTTP headers from your browser. For more information about ActiveProspect‚Äôs data use and collection policies and practices, please review the ActiveProspect Privacy Policy, located at¬†[https://activeprospect.com/privacy-policy/](https://activeprospect.com/privacy-policy/).

Use of Information Collected
----------------------------

Information you provide through the contact form or an online chat will be used so the Company may respond to your inquiries. We may also use the information you provide to communicate with you in the future. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may opt out (unsubscribe) as described below.

_Cookies:_¬†In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, our website may use cookies to store and help track information about you. Cookies are simply small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer‚Äôs hard drive. We use cookies to help remind us who you are and to help you navigate our site during your visits.

The use of cookies is relatively standard. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, if you prefer, you can set your browser to either notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. In some instances, certain features of many sites may not function properly if you don‚Äôt accept cookies.

How is Personal Information Protected?
--------------------------------------

We take various appropriate security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We cannot guarantee, however, that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures.

### Do You Sell My Information?

**We DO NOT sell, rent, or lease mailing lists or other user data to others**, nor will we make your personal information available to any unaffiliated parties, except as follows:

* To agents, website vendors, and/or contractors who may use it on our behalf or in connection with their relationship with us.
* As required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are acquired by another firm or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to protect our rights or property.

Unsubscribe or Opt-Out

You may opt out (unsubscribe) from future communications at any time by sending an email to¬†[marketing@taxdefensenetwork.com](mailto:marketing@taxdefensenetwork.com)¬†with the word ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù in the subject line. You may also call, submit an online contact form, or mail your request.
