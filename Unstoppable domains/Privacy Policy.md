#### PRIVACY POLICY

###### This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how Unstoppable Domains Inc. and its related companies (“Company”) collect, use and share personal information of users of this website, [www.UnstoppableDomains.com](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto which is controlled by the Company (the “Site”), and any related features, functions, products, services, materials or other information made available through this website and the Company’s APIs (collectively, the “Services”). This Policy also applies to any of our other websites that link to this Policy. This Policy does not apply to websites that link to different statements.

###### WHAT WE COLLECT

###### We may collect your email address and phone number as well as other information you give us directly on our Site or through our Services. Specifically, when you opt in to have a 3rd party account verified, for example a DNS record or Twitter user handle, we collect this information and may also log that information to the blockchain. We may enrich the information about you with data from other sources. We may add this to information we get from this Site or our Services. We automatically log information about you and your computer. For example, when visiting our Site, we log browser type, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and actions on our Site. We may log information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.

###### USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

###### The information you enter on our Site or Services can be published to the blockchain through the use of our software that allows you to broadcast a transaction to the blockchain network. Once broadcast to the blockchain network, we cannot control how others may use your personal information. Please think of your blockchain domain as a “Public Profile” much like any other social account, and realize that others will have access to the information that you direct us to publish. Specifically, if you post information about yourself in our management portal and then save this information to the blockchain, the information is now publicly available forever.

###### At Unstoppable Domains, we use your personal information as follows:

###### 

* We use your personal information to operate, maintain, and improve our Sites, products, and Services.

###### SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

###### We may share personal information as follows:

###### 

* We may share personal information with your consent. For example, you may share personal information with others by publishing that information to the blockchain. Please understand that once this information is published, in some cases it cannot be unpublished (as one of the chief purposes of blockchain systems is to enable data provenance through ensuring accurate and immutable record keeping).
* We may share personal information when we do a business deal, or negotiate a business deal, involving the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets. These deals can include any merger, financing, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding.
* We may share personal information for legal, protection, and safety purposes. We may share information to comply with applicable laws.

* We may share information with those who need it to do work for us.

###### DECENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS AND UD.ME EMAIL ADDRESSES

###### We may share UD.me email addresses with third party decentralized applications (“DAPPs”) for the purposes of improving your user experience. To the extent your UD.me email address contains personal information, this personal information may be shared with the DAPP who will be a separate and independent controller of this personal information. Where we transfer your personal information to a DAPP, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such DAPP has appropriate technical and organizational in place to protect your personal information and comply with applicable data protection laws. For further information about how a DAPP processes your personal information, please visit their privacy policy, generally available on their website.

Non-marketing emails include emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you. You may send requests about personal information to our Contact Information below.

    ###### We use this information to provide you the features and functionality of the European Services, to monitor and improve the European Services and to develop new services.
    
    ###### The table at **Annex 2** sets out further information about the categories of personal information we collect about you automatically and how we use that information.

Where we retain information pursuant to Legal Obligation, we retain such information for 7 years.
    
    ###### The criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:
    
    1. ###### **Legitimate Interests.** Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

    3. ###### **Contract.** Where we are processing personal information based on contract, we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship.
        
    4. ###### **Legal Obligation.** Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfil the legal obligation.
        
    5. ###### **Legal Claim.** We may need to apply a "legal hold" that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.
        
    
    ###### In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information.

    ###### Our European Services uses cookies and similar technologies such as pixels and Local Storage Objects (LSOs) like HTML5 (together "cookies") to distinguish you from other users of our European Services. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our European Services and also allows us to monitor and analyse how you use and interact with our European Services so that we can continue to improve our European Services. It also helps us and our advertising partners to determine products and services that may be of interest to you, in order to serve you targeted advertisements.
    
    ###### Cookies are pieces of code that allow for personalisation of our European Services experience by saving your information such as user ID and other preferences. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
    
    ###### We use the following types of cookies:
    
    1. **Strictly necessary cookies.** These are cookies that are required for the operation of our European Services. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our European Services.
    2. **Analytical/performance cookies.** They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our European Services when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our European Services works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
    3. **Functionality cookies.** These are used to recognise you when you return to our European Services. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
    4. **Targeting cookies.** These cookies record your visit to our European Services, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our European Services and the advertising displayed on it, and the marketing messages we send to you more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties who provide services to us for this purpose.
    5. **Third party cookies.** Please be aware that advertisers and other third parties may use their own cookies tags when you click on an advertisement or link on our European Services. These third parties are responsible for setting out their own cookie and privacy policies.
    
    ###### Please see **Annex 3** for more information about the cookies we use on the European Services.
    
    ###### Other than strictly necessary cookies, which are required for the operation of our European Services, we will only place cookies on your device if you give us your consent to do so. We will ask you to tell us which cookies you agree to receive when you first access our European Services.
    
    ###### Most browsers also allow you to change your cookie settings to block certain cookies. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. Please note that if you choose to refuse all cookies you may not be able to use the full functionality of our European Services. These settings will typically be found in the "options" or "preferences" menu of your browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the "Help" option in your browser for more details.

We and our third-party partners may also use cookies and tracking technologies for advertising purposes.
    
    ###### Please note that deleting or blocking cookies may not be effective for all types of tracking technologies, such as Local Storage Objects (LSOs) like HTML5.
    
10. ###### TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES USED IN OUR EMAILS
    
    ###### Our emails may contain tracking pixels that identify if and when you have opened an email that we have sent you, how many times you have read it and whether you have clicked on any links in that email. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing email campaigns, make the emails we send to you more relevant to your interests and to understand if you have opened and read any important administrative emails we might send you.
    
    ###### Most popular email clients will allow you to block these pixels by disabling certain external images in emails. You can do this through the settings on your email client – these generally give you the option of choosing whether emails will display “remote images”, “remote content” or “images” by default.
    
    ###### Some browsers also give you the option of downloading and installing extensions that block pixels and other tracking technologies.
