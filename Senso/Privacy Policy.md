* HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the United Kingdom.
* Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.

We require all third parties to respect the security of the personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use the personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

**6\. International transfers**

Some of our external third parties store and process data outside of the **(EEA)**. We can provide information of where each of the above processors in section 6 processes data but please be assured that each processor is a mass provider of services on a global basis and, we have reviewed provisions and terms carefully. We do not contract with third party processors unless we are satisfied that they operate in a country with a valid adequacy decision in place or otherwise the contracts ensure the same levels of personal data protection that apply under the UK data protection legislation.

**7\. Data security**

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

**8\. Data retention**

**How long will you use my personal information for?**

We will only retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, operational, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

**No fee usually required**

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data as set out in section 9. There will not be a charge to access the personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if the request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

**9\. Your legal rights**

Under certain circumstances you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see section 8 for details on how you request or action these legal rights.

You have the right to:

**Request access** to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

**Request correction** of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold to be corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data provided.

**Request erasure** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal information where you have successfully exercised the right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed the personal information unlawfully or where we are required to erase personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with requests for the erasure as a result of specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of the request.

**Object to processing** of personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about the particular situation which makes you object to processing on the ground it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing such Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process the Personal Information which override your rights and freedoms.

**Request restriction of processing** of the personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you need us to establish the personal information’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the personal information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the personal information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to the use of the personal information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

**Request the transfer of your personal Information to you or to a third party**. This does not apply to the personal information we collect and process for you.

**Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before the withdrawal of your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

**GLOSSARY**

**Lawful Basis:**

**Legitimate Interest** means the interest of Renato in conducting and managing its business to enable it to give you the best service and the best and most secure experience. For example we have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may send you marketing that is tailored to your interests in our business and the Site. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal information for our legitimate interests.
