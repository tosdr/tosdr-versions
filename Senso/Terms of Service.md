Terms of Service for website

**Terms of Service**
--------------------

**1\. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS.**

1.1. Renato Software Ltd. A/S (referred to here as “Renato”) provides its Service (as defined below) to You through its web sites located at www.senso.cloud (the “Site”), subject to this Terms of Service agreement (“TOS”). By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service or Site, You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this TOS. If You are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company or other legal entity, You represent that You have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these TOS, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If You do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these TOS, You must not accept these TOS and may not use the Service.

1.2. Renato may change this TOS from time to time without prior notice. You can review the most current version of this TOS at any time at https://www.senso.cloud/TOS. The revised terms and conditions will become effective upon posting and if You use the Service after that date, we will treat your use as acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to this TOS is not acceptable to You, your only remedy is to stop accessing and using the Service.

**2\. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE.**

2.1. The “Service” includes (a) the Site, (b) the tools and services provided through the Site, and (c) all software, data, text, images, sounds, video, and content made available through the Site or services (collectively referred to as the “Content”), and (d) "any end point or installed software that connects to, utilizes or facilitates the service". Any new features added to or augmenting the Service are also subject to this TOS.

**3\. GENERAL CONDITIONS/ ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICE.**

3.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this TOS, You may access and use the Service only for your internal business purposes as contemplated by the Agreement. You shall not (a) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Service available to any third party, other than as expressly permitted by this TOS; (b) use the Service to process data on behalf of any third party, or (c) use the Service in any unlawful manner or in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Service and its components.

3.2. Subject only to the limited right to access and use the Service expressly granted to You under this TOS, all rights, title and interest in and to the Service and its components will remain with and belong exclusively to Renato. You shall not modify, adapt or hack the Service to falsely imply any sponsorship or association with Renato, or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks.

3.3. You are responsible for all information, data, text, messages or other materials that You post or otherwise transmit via the Service. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login and account and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your login or account. You agree and acknowledge that your login may only be used by one (1) person – a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.

3.4. You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your content, may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices and (c) transmission to Renato’s third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate and maintain the Service.

3.5. The failure of Renato to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this TOS shall not be a waiver of that right.

**4\. TRADEMARKS.**

"senso" and Renatos’ various logos used or displayed on the Service are trademarks of Renato and you may only use these trademarks or logos for promotional purposes to identify yourself as a customer or user of the Renato products and services, provided you do not attempt to claim ownership of the marks by incorporating any of them within your names or offerings.

**5\. PAYMENT AND REFUNDS.**

5.1. The Service is made available on both a trial and a pay-as-you-go basis. If you have elected to sign up for a paid plan, You will be billed yearly starting on the day after your account was upgraded. There are no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle or an invoice will be issued. Downgrading your account may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your account. Renato does not accept any liability for such loss. Prices of all Services, including but not limited to yearly fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time.

5.2. Contact Renato to change billing information (e.g., upon renewal) and to terminate your subscription. Renato uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information except to process your credit card information for Renato.

**6\. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION.**

6.1. You are responsible for properly cancelling your account. The account owner (as defined in the sign-up procedure) can cancel the account at any time. if You cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up year, your cancellation will take effect immediately before the next paid term and you will not be charged again.

6.2. Renato reserves the right to (i) modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) and (ii) refuse any and all current and future use of the Service, suspend or terminate your account (any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any of your content in the Service, for any reason, including, if Renato believes that You have violated these TOS. Renato will use best efforts to publish on the Site or notify You about any planned downtime of the Service, and will use all reasonable efforts to contact you directly via email to warn you prior to suspension or termination of your account. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Renato shall not be liable to You or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuation of the Service.

**7\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.**  
THE SERVICE, INCLUDING THE SITE AND CONTENT, AND ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND Renato EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT Renato DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR VIRUS-FREE AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM Renato OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS TOS.

**8\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.**

8.1. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL Renato BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. IN ADDITION, Renato SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES OR LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF THE MONTHLY SERVICE FEE PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU FOR THE ONE MONTH PRECEDING THE TIME OF ANY CLAIM FOR MONETARY DAMAGES OR ONE HUNDRED ($100) U.S. DOLLARS. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS TOS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
