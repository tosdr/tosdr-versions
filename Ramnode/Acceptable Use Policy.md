5\. Resource Usage.

5.1. Virtual Private Servers (“VPS”). CPU cores and disk I/O are shared among multiple VPSs. If Customer’s VPS is consistently maxing out one full core or more and impacting the performance of other Company customers’ servers sharing the same host node, Company may (as determined in its sole and absolute discretion) ask Customer to or may reduce Customer usage. Load may be generated by CPU usage and/or disk I/O. Disruptive loads may result in a reboot, shutdown, suspension and/or termination of access to the Products and VPS regardless of the time lapse involved.

5.2. CPU Usage. Customer agrees that Customer shall not use excessive amounts, as defined by Company (in its sole and absolute discretion), of CPU processing on any of Company’s servers. Excessive usage may result in corrective action by Company, including assessment of additional charges, suspension or disconnection of any and all Products, or termination of the Agreements, which actions may be taken in Company’s sole and absolute discretion. If Company takes any corrective action under this section, Customer shall not be entitled to a refund of any fees paid in advance prior to such action.

5.3. Bandwidth and Disk Usage. Company shall provide Customer with a large volume of bandwidth, disk space, and other resources as defined in the Order or within the Product. The Products are intended for reasonable, as determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, business use only. Any activity that results in excessive usage inconsistent with reasonable usage patterns is strictly prohibited. Customer agrees that such bandwidth and disk usage shall not exceed the amounts set by Company for the Product (the “Agreed Usage”). The Agreed Usage allotments are optimized and dedicated towards serving the Customer Content. Customer shall not use any bandwidth and/or disk usage for materials other than the Customer Content. Company will monitor Customer’s bandwidth and disk usage. Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall have the right to take any corrective action if Customer’s bandwidth or disk usage exceeds the Agreed Usage or other violation of the storage or usage parameters. Such corrective action may include the assessment of additional charges, suspension, disconnection or discontinuance of any and all Products, removal or deletion of Customer Content and/or other materials or termination of the Agreements, which actions may be taken in Company’s sole and absolute discretion. If Company takes any such corrective action under this section, Customer shall not be entitled to a refund or credit of any fees paid prior to such action. 

5.4. VDS CPU Cores. VDS CPU cores are dedicated per VDS. Customer may use 100% of the allocated CPU indefinitely. I/O and network ports are shared like a VPS, so at Company’s sole and absolute discretion, Customer may be required to reduce usage and/or shutdown VDS. 

5.5. Shared. Company’s shared hosting product is not a replacement for a content delivery network (i.e., streaming video or other files off site, storage of large files or large quantities of seldomly used data or images; ffmpeg, its alternatives, and mass video streaming websites are not allowed for our shared hosting). If Customer is found hosting files that use a larger portion of storage and/or bandwidth than what is considered typical for a shared hosting environment, Company may ask Customer to reduce Customer’s usage or upgrade to a virtual server or Company may reduce or limit Customer’s usage or may suspend or terminate the Account. Excessive bandwidth usage due to website abuse or brute force attacks may result in suspension or termination of the Products. 

5.6. Hosting. While Company offers disk space and bandwidth, the purpose of the hosting account is to host websites. Using a hosting account primarily for online file storage or archiving electronic files, ffmpeg and/or similar alternatives, and mass video or content streaming is prohibited. Shared Hosting plans are shared hosting environments, and to ensure fast and reliable service to all of Company’s customers, conduct that adversely affects Company’s customers, its server or network performance must be immediately corrected or Customer will be asked to upgrade to a virtual or dedicated server or Company may reduce or limit Customer’s usage or may suspend or terminate the Account.

5.7. Jailed Access. Company provides jailed Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell (“SSH”) access for Company’s shared hosting customers as a courtesy. If Customer is found installing or running processes that are meant for a non-shared environment (e.g., voice servers, shoutcast, etc.) those processes will be terminated and Customer’s SSH access will be denied and/or removed. SSH access should only be used for file and permission management and other day to day tasks that are more easily accomplished via a terminal. 

5.8. No Proxies. Shared or reseller hosting customers cannot be used to host private or public proxies. Shared or reseller hosting customers found using proxies will be required to either upgrade or Company may suspend or terminate the Account.

6\. Suspension and Termination. Customer understands and agrees that Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines whether any information transmitted or received violates this AUP and may investigate any suspected violation of this AUP or the UToS, and remove or disable access to any content or resource that violates this AUP, including conduct related to Customer Content. Customer agrees to cooperate with Company to remedy any violation and cooperate with any law enforcement agency. When determining whether there has been a violation, Company may consider Customer’s ability and willingness to comply with this AUP, including the policies and processes Customer has in place to prevent or identify and remove any prohibited content or activity.

7\. Indemnification. Customer shall be solely responsible, will be held liable and shall indemnify and hold Company and its employees, officers, directors and agents harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by a third party arising from Customer’s breach of this AUP and any and all of Customer Content that is submitted through an Account. Customer shall be solely responsible and will be held liable and shall indemnify and hold Company and its employees, officers, directors and agents harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by a third party arising from the incorrect setting of netmasks, routes, or any other network configuration or programming issue which causes unnecessary broadcast or multicast traffic on the Websites, through the Products or on Company’s network, or denial of service, deliberate or not, caused by forging address resolution protocol queries or replies or by configuring internet protocol addresses into Customer’s hardware or software which were not assigned to Customer’s Account. The foregoing actions may result in disconnection of the Products and suspension or termination of an Account, as determined by Company. Any loss of functionality of an Account related to the foregoing actions will be and remain the Customer’s sole responsibility. 

8\. No Content Monitoring. While Company does not monitor Customer, Customer Content or a third-party’s use of the Websites and/or Products to confirm compliance with the terms of this AUP, UToS, or any other applicable Company policy(ies), if Company obtains any information of Customer’s violation of any such terms or policies, as determined in Company’s sole discretion, Company maintains the absolute right to suspend or terminate an Account or delete any material (including Customer Content) Company deems illegal, inappropriate, or violative of any Company or applicable third-party terms or policy(ies). If Company discovers a violation, it will take whatever action it deems reasonably necessary or appropriate to address such behavior, which may include (but is not limited to) disclosing Customer’s personal information to a third party(ies) or law enforcement agencies and may suspend and/or terminate any agreement with Customer and/or Customer’s access to the Products and Websites. CUSTOMER HEREBY WAIVES AND HOLDS COMPANY HARMLESS, ALONG WITH COMPANY’S EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AFFILIATES, LICENSEES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RESULTING FROM, OR ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF, ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER COMPANY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES. In the event Company takes corrective action due to a violation of this AUP, Company shall not refund to Customer any fees paid in advance of such corrective action. Customer hereby agrees that Company shall have no liability to Customer or any of Customer’s customers due to any corrective action that Company may take hereunder.

9\. AUP Violation Claims. Company requests that any person or entity who believes that a violation of this AUP or any other Company terms or policy(ies) has occurred may report the alleged violation(s) to Company. Such a report can be reported by email sent to [legal@ramnode.com](mailto:legal@ramnode.com) or postal mail at the physical address listed below.
