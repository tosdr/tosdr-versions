When you click on a link to a Third-Party Website, Third-Party Application or Third-Party Ad, we will not warn you that you have left SpanishDictionary.com Properties and are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another website or destination.

You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Websites or Third-Party Applications, and make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.

**7.2 App Stores.** You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and the Services is dependent on the third party from whom you received the Application license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play (each, an “App Store”). You acknowledge that the Agreement is between you and SpanishDictionary.com and not with the App Store.

You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Agreement and will have the right to enforce it.

8\. Fees and Purchase Terms
---------------------------

**8.1 Payment.** You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You must provide SpanishDictionary.com with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) or PayPal account (“Payment Provider”), or purchase order information as a condition to signing up for the Services. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card or PayPal account, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing SpanishDictionary.com with your credit card number or PayPal account and associated payment information, you agree that SpanishDictionary.com is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to SpanishDictionary.com hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify SpanishDictionary.com of any change in your billing address or the credit card or PayPal account used for payment hereunder. SpanishDictionary.com reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on SpanishDictionary.com Properties or by e-mail delivery to you.

**8.2 Service Subscription Fees.** You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any Services (each, a “Service Subscription Fee”) at the time you choose to purchase a subscription service (each, a “Service Commencement Date”). If you are not satisfied with your purchase, a full refund of the purchase price can be requested within thirty (30) days of the Purchase Date. The thirty-day money back guarantee is limited to purchases made directly through SpanishDictionary.com and does not apply to purchases made through any third-party vendors including Apple or Google. No contract will exist between you and SpanishDictionary.com for the Services until SpanishDictionary.com accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of communication.

**8.3 Taxes.** The payments required under Section 9.2 of this Agreement do not include any Sales Tax that may be due in connection with the Services provided under this Agreement. If SpanishDictionary.com determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you in connection with this Agreement, SpanishDictionary.com shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the payments required under Section 9.2 of this Agreement. If any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to SpanishDictionary.com, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify SpanishDictionary.com for any liability or expense SpanishDictionary.com may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon SpanishDictionary.com’s request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

**8.4 Automatic Renewal.** Although you may choose your payment plan for subscription services (i.e. 1 month, 6 months, or 12 months), your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Agreement. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each, a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at SpanishDictionary.com’s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless and until you cancel your subscription. Cancellation must occur prior to the Renewal Commencement Date and can be achieved by logging into and selecting the “Cancel auto-renew” option in the Subscriptions menu at the bottom of your “Settings” page. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize SpanishDictionary.com to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if SpanishDictionary.com does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand and/or (b) you agree that SpanishDictionary.com may continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin original date of attempted charge). In the event that SpanishDictionary.com fails to receive payment after repeated charge attempts, you agree that your subscription may be terminated. In order to reinstate a subscription service following termination, you may visit the spanishdict.com/premium-plans page to select and purchase your subscription of choice.

If you wish to extend your subscription plan duration, you may do so at any time by logging into and selecting the “Change” option in the Subscriptions menu at the bottom of your “Settings” page. The maximum duration for a subscription service is 12 months. Changes to your plan may impact the billing intervals and fees charged for the subscription services you receive. If you make an inadvertent change to your subscription plan duration, please contact SpanishDictionary.com to have the change reversed.

**8.5 Free Trials and Other Promotions.** Any free trial or other promotion that provides Registered User level access to the Services must be used within the specified time of the trial. At the end of the trial period, your use of that Service will expire and any further use of the Service is prohibited unless you pay the applicable subscription fee. If you are inadvertently charged for a subscription, please contact SpanishDictionary.com to have the charges reversed.

9\. Indemnification
-------------------

You agree to indemnify and hold SpanishDictionary.com, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners, suppliers, and licensors (each, a “SpanishDictionary.com Party” and collectively, the “SpanishDictionary.com Parties”) harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of any and all of the following: (a) Your Content; (b) your use of, or inability to use, any SpanishDictionary.com Property; (c) your violation of the Agreement; (d) your violation of any rights of another party, including any Users; or (e) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. SpanishDictionary.com reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with SpanishDictionary.com in asserting any available defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the SpanishDictionary.com Parties for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Website or any Services provided hereunder. You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your Account, the Agreement and/or your access to SpanishDictionary.com Properties.

16\. Dispute Resolution
-----------------------

Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with SpanishDictionary.com and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.

* 16.1 **Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with SpanishDictionary.com, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify,; and (2) you or SpanishDictionary.com may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.
* 16.2 **Arbitration Rules and Forum.** The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent \[include name and address of registered agent here\]. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, SpanishDictionary.com will pay them for you. In addition, SpanishDictionary.com will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.

You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

* 16.3 **Authority of Arbitrator.** The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and SpanishDictionary.com. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
* 16.4 **Waiver of Jury Trial.** YOU AND SPANISHDICTIONARY.COM HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and SpanishDictionary.com are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
* 16.5 **Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.** ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of Virginia. All other claims shall be arbitrated.
* 16.6 **30-Day Right to Opt Out.** You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: support@spanishdict.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your SpanishDictionary.com username (if any), the email address you used to set up your SpanishDictionary.com account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
* 16.7 **Severability.** Except as provided in subsection 17.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
* 16.8 **Survival of Agreement.** This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with SpanishDictionary.com.
* 16.9 **Modification.** Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if SpanishDictionary.com makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing SpanishDictionary.com at the following address: Curiosity Media, 777 Mariners Island Blvd., Suite 600, San Mateo, CA 94404.
