A defective Sonos product? This is our Sonos Warranty.

We stand for the quality of our Sonos products. We offer a one (1) year full warranty on all products sold. The details of this warranty are set out in our [Terms of Use, License and Warranty Agreement](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/legal/terms-of-use). A summary of the conditions of the Sonos Warranty is set out below. In the event that there is any conflict between this summary and the Terms of Use, License and Warranty Agreement, the Terms of Use, License and Warranty Agreement will control.  
  
Your local consumer protection laws may provide additional rules on warranty. The Sonos Warranty does not in any way restrict the rights that you may have under such rules.  
  
The Sonos Warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship in every Sonos product for one (1) year from the date of shipment from Sonos or the date of the original retail purchase from an Authorized Sonos Dealer. The Sonos warranty does not guarantee that Sonos products will at all times operate without interruption or will be error-free, or that all errors may be corrected.  
  
If you have a valid claim under the Sonos Warranty and have returned the product in accordance with the procedure set out below, we will repair or replace the defective product free of cost.  
  
If we determine that the problem is not covered under the Sonos Warranty, we will notify you and inform you of service or replacement alternatives that are available to you for an additional fee.  
  
The warranty period is not extended if we repair or replace your product.  
  
Your Sonos Warranty is transferable with ownership, so if you give or sell the Sonos product to someone during the guarantee period, it's still covered.  
  
There are some exclusions to the Sonos Warranty, including but not limited to:  
  

* Problems that result from external causes such as accident, abuse or misuse;
* Use that is not in accordance with Sonos' product instructions;
* Products with missing or altered serial numbers;
