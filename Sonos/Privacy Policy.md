The Types of Personal Information We Collect

Information you provide to us

We collect information you voluntarily provide to us, such as your name, phone number and email address; for instance, when you want to learn more about Sonos Products and Services or when you contact our Customer Support group for assistance with your Sonos Products.

Information we collect from our Products or Services

Sonos Products are media devices which are designed to connect to each other (a “Sonos System”) as well as to music and other content delivered through media servers in the cloud. Accordingly, there is a certain amount of information which will always need to be collected for the Sonos Products to function as intended (“[Functional Data](#legal-privacy-2024-interactions-using)") (as further outlined below). Beyond Functional Data, there is additional data (e.g. telemetry data) which we encourage our customers to share as it helps us improve your experience with Sonos Products and offer better, personalized Sonos Products and Services ("[Additional Usage Data](#legal-privacy-2024-interactions-using)") (as further outlined below). When you visit our website, we may collect information about you by using cookies, pixels and other similar technologies. We may, for example, collect information about the type of device you use to access our websites, the operating system and version, your IP address, your general geographic location as indicated by your IP address, your browser type, the webpages you view on our websites, and whether and how you interact with content available on our websites. To learn more about how we use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies, see [below](#legal-privacy-2024-cookies-container).

Information obtained from other sources

We may receive information about you from other sources, including third parties, such as music service partners and partners with whom we offer co-branded services or engage in joint-marketing activities. We may also receive information about you from social media platforms, for instance, when you interact with us on social media. We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this Statement and we also apply any additional restrictions imposed by the source of data.

Our Customers

Sonos does not target and is not intended to attract children under sixteen. Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website or use our App, we do not knowingly collect or request personal information from those under the age of sixteen without parental consent. If, following a notification by a parent or guardian or discovery by other means, a child under sixteen has been improperly registered on our site using false information, we will cancel the child's account and delete the child's personal information from our records.

[Return to top](#main)

Customer Interactions with Sonos

To make the information in this Statement easy to understand, we have highlighted different occasions when Sonos could potentially collect information from customers. The relevant sections in the Statement apply to you to the extent you use certain Products and/or Services and they are made available to you in your region.

Learning about Sonos

As you gather more information about Sonos, you may virtually or physically engage with us on an open platform. Examples include browsing our website, engaging with our social media channels, and calling our sales representatives. To learn more about Sonos Products, you may voluntarily provide personal information, such as your name and email address during these interactions. We may also collect information about you online via [cookies, pixels, and similar technologies](#legal-privacy-2024-cookies-container) when you visit our websites.  
  
**We collect:** name, email address, IP address, and information provided by cookies, pixels, or similar technologies.  
  
**Why:** We use this information to share news about events and products offered by Sonos or our partners, and provide you with more customized advertising and marketing offers. Additionally, the IP address helps us to understand geographic information about our websites’ visitors better so that we can improve our website for everyone. It is our legitimate interest to process your personal data for these purposes.

Buying Sonos Products and Services

Once you have decided to buy a Sonos Product and/or Service, we offer a way for customers to buy directly from us at www.sonos.com. When you buy from us, you will be asked to provide information so that we can complete your purchase.  
  
**We collect:** your name, phone number, email address, delivery/shipping address, company information (optional), and payment information including billing address (if different from shipping), credit card information.  
  
**Why:** We use this information to complete your transaction, follow up with you about your purchase, help with any delivery issues, handle returns, and other issues related to the purchase of your Sonos Products and/or Services. Processing your personal data for this purpose is necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you. **Please note, we do not store any payment or credit card information. We only use payment information in connection with the purchase of Sonos Products and Services.**

Setting up your Sonos Product

At Sonos we offer different types of audio products, some of which are primarily designed to be used as part of a broader Sonos System (most often in the home)(“System Products”) and others which are intended to be used primarily as an individual product (including outside of the home) and may be used in Bluetooth mode only (“Individual Products”).

System Products

Once you receive your Sonos System Products, you will be required to connect your Sonos System Product to a local network. Each Sonos System Product needs to be connected to the internet for setup. As part of the initial setup, you will be asked to download the Sonos App from either our website or a third-party website, such as the Google Play Store. The Sonos App allows you to control your Sonos System from the device of your choice (for example your phone or tablet). During the setup process, the Sonos App will ask you to set up an account and register your system with Sonos. **You must register your Sonos System Products in order for your Sonos System Products to work.**  
  
As part of registering any Sonos Product, the App will prompt you to enter information such as an email address and location data (country, postcode) which is required to provide this information to register your Sonos Products or System. Your Sonos System will then establish a unique alpha-numeric identification number which we use to help identify your specific Sonos System in a less personal manner. This identification number will be associated with the email address that you provide along with the individual Sonos Product serial number and the IP address from where the Sonos Product connected. As part of registration, you will need to set up a Sonos account. We collect your password to your Sonos account which is only used for authentication and Sonos account access.  
  
**We collect:** your name, phone number, email address, location data, language preference, Product serial number, your password and IP address. Please note, your password is stored using one-way hash, which means that it cannot be recovered (or disclosed) by anyone, including Sonos.  
  
**Why:** We collect this information to help get your Sonos Product and/or Service working securely (which helps prevent unauthorized access to your Sonos Products, Services or home network).This processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interest of ensuring network and information security when you are provided with Products and Services. Specifically, a Sonos account is necessary to authenticate users and to ensure that a specific device is linked to a specific account and user. As part of our legitimate interest assessment, Sonos performed a balancing test. You can obtain information about this balancing test upon request, by sending an email to privacy@sonos.com. Also, we collect this information to make sure that we enable you to select the right music service options based on your geographic location (e.g. radio stations available in your country). This processing is necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you. We also use your email to send you Sonos-related notifications, such as promotional messages, software updates, information about Sonos Products and/or Services, and to share exciting Sonos news and Product offerings. It is our legitimate interest to process your personal data for these purposes.

Individual Sonos Products

Once you receive your Sonos Individual Products, you may use them out of the box by connecting the Individual Product to a Bluetooth enabled device. Prior to registering your Individual Product to a Sonos System, we do not collect any information when you use your Individual Products in Bluetooth mode, however other services such as the device you connect to may collect certain information (for example your phone). Please see any privacy statement that accompanies such device for information about how such data is handled. You may continue to use your Sonos Individual Products in Bluetooth mode for as long as you like. If you decide to connect your Individual Products to your Sonos System, the devices will then behave like a Sonos System Product and we will collect data in the manner outlined above in the “System Products” section. For purposes of the remainder of this Privacy Statement, an Individual Product which has been connected to a Sonos System shall be considered an System Product and data shall be collected in the manner outlined herein for System Products.

Using Sonos Products and Services

At Sonos we believe you can enjoy great Products and Services without compromising your privacy. Learn more about how we use your personal information here.  
  
The information we collect from your Sonos System (including Sonos System Products, Individual Products that have been registered to your Sonos System, or the Sonos App) includes Functional Data, Advanced Feature Data, and Additional Usage Data. There are three main reasons we collect this information from your Sonos System Products: (1) to offer you music services or other audio content choices (e.g. radio, tv or games) which is necessary for the performance of the agreement we have with you, (2) to offer you control over your Sonos System (e.g. app, voice) which is necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you, and (3) to make your Sonos Products and Services better over time which is our legitimate interest.  
  

Functional Data

Sonos System Products work by connecting to a local wifi network which allows you to stream music from a music service to one or more of your connected System Products. In order for these System Products to function properly, there is a certain amount of information that must be collected by us and routed through servers in the cloud. This includes:  
  

1. Registration Data. This data includes your email address, location, language preference, Product serial number, IP address, and Sonos account login information (as described above).
2. System Data. This data includes things like Product type, controller device type, controller operating system, software version, security state, content source (audio line in), signal input (e.g. whether your TV outputs a specific audio signal such as Dolby to your Sonos system), information about WiFi antennas, information about Bluetooth, system settings (such as equalization or stereo pair), Product orientation, names of the music service(s) you added/enabled on your Sonos Product, the names you have given your Sonos Products in different rooms, whether your Product has been tuned using Sonos Trueplay technology, system performance metrics (e.g. the temperature of your Product or WiFi signal strength), WiFi Security Mode, and error information.
3. Content Management and Activity Information. This data includes information about your music services and music service use, Product or room grouping information, content control information (such as play, pause, change volume, or skip tracks), and information about playlists, recently played, favorites, “now playing” and track data, (each correlated to individual Sonos Products and your interactions with them). If you enable voice control or use Sonos Radio, we will additionally collect information about track data when using those features (see the Advanced Features section below).

  
**Why we collect Functional Data:** We collect this information to help ensure that your Sonos Products are working properly, to provide you with customer support and to honor your audio commands and preferences which is necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you. We also collect this information to guide product improvement and customer support decisions which is our legitimate interest.

Advanced Features

To get the most out of your Sonos system and enable all functionality, there are certain features for which additional data will be shared with us when you use the applicable feature. For these advanced features you have the option to not use the feature, which will minimize the data we obtain about your Sonos System. These features include:  
  
  
  

1. Voice Control. If your Individual Sonos Product is voice capable (not every product is voice capable), you will have to actively enable voice control for your Sonos System Product to utilize the voice feature. Voice control works by your voice-enabled Sonos Product 'listening' for a key wake word. In greater depth, this means that the voice-enabled Sonos Product continuously buffers (stores data for the time that it is being processed) locally, without transmitting or storing any information, unless it detects the wake word or phrase (“Hey Sonos” or “Alexa”) which triggers the device to begin processing the vocal request (for third party voice control, see below). If the Sonos Product does not detect the wake word, it continues to record over itself in a never-ending loop lasting a few mili-seconds. This is all done locally on your Sonos Product and is not sent to Sonos or any third party. If a wake word is detected, the Sonos Product begins processing the vocal request. In other words, it does not retain any audio data, or begin to transmit any data until it is 'woken up.'  
      
    
    1. Sonos Voice Control. **If the detected wake word is “Hey Sonos”, your voice command is processed locally on your product and no audio data will be saved. Both the voice recording and transcript are never sent to the cloud and Sonos does not retain a copy or transcript of your voice recording.**
    2. Third Party Voice Control. If the wake word is the one of a Third Party Voice service you have activated (e.g., Alexa), once the wake word is detected, the recording of your voice command is then sent to the voice partner you have authorized to receive such recording (for example, Amazon). **Sonos does not retain a copy or transcript of your voice recording.** Use of any Third Party Voice service is subject to the third-party’s terms of use or service and their respective privacy notices. We encourage you to read these third-party terms carefully before you enable them on your Sonos Products.
    
      
      
    Sharing the relevant data with these partners and further processing such data is necessary for the performance of the contracts with these partners for your benefit, in order to ensure that the voice control function is working properly. This information is needed to fulfil the agreement we have with you, to ensure proper functionality, and to help improve these features which is also our legitimate interest.
2. Sonos Radio. To help our customers get the music playing quickly once you take a Sonos Product out of the box, we offer an advertising supported content service called Sonos Radio. If you choose to use Sonos Radio, we will collect information about track and station data and location-based information when using Sonos Radio. Collecting this data is necessary for our licensing and reporting obligations as well as advertising purposes and is our legitimate interest. For more information on this, please visit [Provide Sonos Radio Service](#legal-privacy-2024-use-info-radio).
3. Home control Integrations  
      
    For customers who wish to control their Sonos System using a home control product (e.g. Lutron), you will need to go through a process to connect such devices with your Sonos system (similar to the process you go through to connect a music service). Once enabled, we collect and process the Functional Data and Sonos will share a subset of this data with the partner/s that provide/s the services you have requested.  
      
    Sharing your relevant data with these partners and further processing such data is necessary for the performance of the contracts with these partners for your benefit, in order to ensure that the direct control function is working properly. This information is needed to fulfil the agreement we have with you, to ensure proper functionality and to help improve these features which is also our legitimate interest.
4. Trueplay and Audio Optimization  
      
    1. Trueplay. Trueplay is a feature we offer which analyzes acoustic factors that can impact sound quality in the room where your Sonos Products are placed to optimize the sound quality that comes from your Sonos Products (regardless of where they are placed within the room). In order to use this feature, you will have to enable Trueplay in the Sonos App. To do this, a user goes through an interactive process (watch the video here) that gathers certain data about your speaker setup (for example, the number of speakers and speaker placement), including information about background noise levels and the room acoustics (for example decibel level at each frequency). This information is used to help make sure that the tuning gives you the best sound output possible. The collection of this data is necessary for the fulfillment of the agreement we have with you if you activate Trueplay.  
          
        Once enabled, some of the Products can automatically adjust their sound for your environment with Auto Trueplay (“Auto Trueplay”). Auto Trueplay starts tuning as soon as you begin playing audio. It automatically re-tunes as you play content and bring your Auto Trueplay enabled Product to different locations.
    2. Voice Audio optimization. Concurrent with any voice activity, Sonos System Products will collect data (for example, decibel level at each frequency) about the ambient noise in the room. It is not possible to extract any speech from this type of data. We collect this data to help us improve our speech recognition technology which is our legitimate interest. If you are trying to state a voice command while music is playing, for example, Sonos may improve the technology by lowering the music so that your voice command can be understood properly.

Additional Usage Data

In addition to the information that is required for your Sonos Products to work as outlined above, there is “Additional Usage Data” about your Sonos System Products that you may choose to share with us to help us improve the product experience for all of our Customers. If you opt to share the Additional Usage Data with us, we collect information about performance of your Sonos Products and/or System. This includes things like controller configuration data such as app preferences which capture the state of different settings inside the Sonos app, information about how often you use the Sonos app versus other control mechanisms (voice, etc.), flow of interactions within the Sonos app, controller device settings which capture the state of device-level (e.g. iOS, Android) settings that affect our App (e.g. the state of the system-level permission for Bluetooth, location, etc.); how often you use the physical controls on the unit; how often certain features are used in the Product, reliability data (including Wifi performance), types of HDMI devices connected to the product and audio formats used, hardware faults, duration of Sonos Product use, and, as required for certain Services location-based data using GPS (or similar technology, where available), crowdsourced Wi-Fi access points and cell tower locations collected from your third party device when the Sonos App is in use.  
  
**Why we collect Additional Usage Data.**  
  
We collect this information so that we can help ensure Sonos Products are functioning properly, provide a personalized experience for our customers, determine what types of Product or feature improvements would please our customers most and to help predict potential problems with Sonos Products. You may opt out of sharing this information with us by following the steps listed [here](#legal-privacy-2024-rights-container).

Getting Help from Sonos

From time to time, you may decide to contact our Customer Care group for assistance with your Sonos Products and/or Services. To be able to offer you the best service possible, we may collect certain data from you or your Sonos Products.  
  
**We collect:** This may include contact information, such as your name, email address, phone number, social media identifiers (if you contact us using a social media channel), and the content of your chats and other communications with Sonos Customer Care (including, in some cases, voice recording if you call Customer Care). In certain situations, it is useful for the Customer Care team to have a 'Diagnostic' of your Sonos system. This is essentially a technical system snapshot of all relevant information leading up to the incident and includes information such as the music service being used, volume level, Product configuration, WiFi signal and router information, Bluetooth information, error codes, device information (e.g. the operating system, and version of the Sonos app being used). Collecting the above described information is necessary to provide customer support. You will be informed in advance before we make a snapshot. We do not capture snapshots without telling you first. If you are a Beta tester, we take a daily diagnostic of your Sonos system automatically (per the terms of the Beta tester agreement).  
  
**Why:** We collect this information to give you the best and most efficient customer support possible. For instance, for customer inquiries and technical questions, we use the contact information to respond to the customer in their preferred channel (phone, email, social). For technical problems, we use system diagnostic data to effectively troubleshoot the issue. For product returns and/or exchanges, we use the contact information to ensure successful product receipt and/or delivery. Using these types of your data is necessary to fulfill the agreement we have with you.

Specifically, we may share the following information with our advertising partners: location and language of the registered Sonos user, station genre, listening audience data in the aggregate, and limited location information and identifiers (i.e. an IP address) with some of our third party radio content partners who may run ads on their stations.  
  
Additionally, we may share information with social media companies as outlined above in the “Communication, Marketing, and Advertising” section.

We will transfer your personal information in compliance with applicable data protection laws and will implement suitable safeguards to ensure that your personal information is adequately secured by any third party that will access your information (for instance, by using the Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission).

The Legal Bases for Using Personal Information

There are different legal bases that we rely on to use your personal information, namely:

Performance of a Contract

The use of your personal information may be necessary to perform an agreement you have with us. For example, to complete your purchase of your Sonos Product, to register and maintain your account, to help with delivery issues, to handle returns, to register your Sonos system, to provide you with Sonos Radio and to make sure that your Sonos Product performs its basic functions in a secure way or to respond to your requests.

Consent

Where legally required, we may rely on your consent to use your personal information. When this is the case, we will provide you with more specific information when we actually request your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by sending us an email to [privacy@sonos.com](mailto:privacy@sonos.com). Your withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before your withdrawal.

Compliance with Legal Obligation

We may use your relevant personal information to ensure compliance with applicable laws, for example to comply with lawful requests from law enforcement, and for regulatory investigations and compliance.

Legitimate Interests

We may use your personal information for our legitimate interests. For example, we rely on our legitimate interest to analyze and improve our Sonos Products and Services, including Sonos Radio, and the content on our websites and app, to send you notifications about software updates or information about Sonos Products and Services, and to use your relevant personal data for administrative purposes and for fraud detection and prevention. Furthermore, except where consent is required under applicable local law, we rely on our legitimate interest to send you relevant marketing communications.  
  
When using personal data to serve our legitimate interests, we will always balance your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data against our rights and interests.  
  
Where we process your personal information based on our legitimate interest and no opt-out mechanism is available to you (e.g. in your Sonos Product settings), you may exercise your right to object by sending an email to [privacy@sonos.com](mailto:privacy@sonos.com).

Security, Storage and Retention of Personal Information We Collect

Security

Sonos is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. However, while we take reasonable precautions to guard the personal information we collect, no security system is impenetrable.  
  
We use a variety of appropriate technical and organizational measures and industry standards to protect your personal information and help prevent information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. Additionally, we ensure that our third-party data center vendors provide adequate security measures. Additionally, your data is protected with encryption, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), during transmission over the Internet. Moreover, your password is stored using a one-way hash, which means that it cannot be recovered (or disclosed) by anyone, including Sonos (it can only be reset).  
  
You can only access your Sonos account information and our service through the use of an individual user login and password. To protect the confidentiality of your personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please alert us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. Additionally, always log out and close your browser when you finish your session. **Please note, we will never ask you to disclose your password.**  
  
If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at [privacy@sonos.com](mailto:privacy@sonos.com).

Storage

Personal data collected by Sonos may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Sonos or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers are located or maintain facilities. Sonos has put in place adequate mechanisms to protect personal information when it is transferred internationally, for example by using the Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission.

Retention

Sonos will retain your personal information:  
  

* for as long as we have a customer relationship with you and/or as necessary to enable you to use the website, your Sonos account and/or your Sonos Product(s);
* for the period required to provide services that you request from us;
* for the period required to provide marketing or other promotional materials that you request from us;
* to comply with our legal obligations, including requirements of regulators and governmental agencies that have authority over us such as tax and/or accounting obligations, which usually require retaining certain transaction data for periods between 7 and 10 years after a transaction has occurred;
* for the period required to resolve disputes with any parties and/or to investigate or defend against potential legal claims; and
* otherwise as necessary to allow us to conduct our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

  
  
All personal information we retain will be subject to this Privacy Statement and our internal retention guidelines. Sonos will delete your personal data when it is no longer required for the above-mentioned purposes. If there is any personal data that, for technical reasons, we are unable to delete entirely from our systems, Sonos will implement appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of such data. If you have a question about a specific retention period for certain types of personal information we process about you, please send an email to [privacy@sonos.com](mailto:privacy@sonos.com).

Advertising and Modern Marketing Tools

To help more people listen to more music on Sonos, we use several modern marketing tools in support of our advertising efforts.  
  
Sonos may work with third-party advertisers that use [cookies and similar technologies](#legal-privacy-2024-cookies-container) to provide more relevant advertising about Sonos Products and Services on our websites and across the internet. To provide this 'interest-based advertising', the parties combine information about your online activities acquired over time, which help cater advertising that we deliver to you. Examples of this may include a Sonos advertisement on a Facebook page, or a Google-owned page such as a search results page or YouTube, or on a site within Google’s advertising network. We may obtain your consent to this process depending on local law. At all times, you can opt out of these personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or who follow the [Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/) by visiting the [opt-out pages on the NAI websites](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/) and [DAA websites](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/). Opting out may make the ads you see across the internet less relevant to you. Users that enjoy rights under EU data protection laws can visit [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) to learn how to opt out of having their data used for interest-based advertising by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) member companies.

Sale and Sharing of Personal Information

During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Statement, we may have provided personal information (i.e., hashed email address and cookie related information) to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes, so that we can provide you with more relevant and tailored ads regarding our Products and Services, or use analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base. The disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA, or the “sharing” of your personal information for purposes of “cross-context behavioral advertising.”  
  
The following chart lists the categories of personal information we have sold or shared over the last 12 months and the categories of third parties to which we have sold or shared:  
  

| Categories of Information | Categories of Third Parties to Whom We Have “Sold” This Information | Categories of Third Parties to Whom We Have “Shared” This Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Information about your computer or device, including IP address, time and date of visit, browser type and version, operating system, device make and model. | * Advertising partners and advertisers<br>* Unaffiliated third parties for their advertising purposes<br>* Analytics providers | * Advertising partners and advertisers |
| Contact information, such as hashed email address. | * Advertising partners and advertisers<br>* Unaffiliated third parties for their advertising purposes<br>* Analytics providers | * Advertising partners and advertisers |
| IP address, zip code, Sonos device type (e.g. Beam, One, Arc, etc.), genre of the station you are currently listening to, listener ID, language | * Advertising partners and advertisers<br>* Unaffiliated third parties for their advertising purposes<br>* Analytics providers | * Advertising partners and advertisers |

Your CCPA Right to Opt Out of “Sale” or “Sharing” of Personal Information

Californians have a right to direct us not to “sell” or “share” certain personal information as those terms are defined in the CCPA. You can exercise that right by following the steps on our Your Privacy Choices page.  
  
Your browser may also offer a way to activate the Global Privacy Control signal (“GPC”). Our websites each treat qualifying browsers for which the user has activated the GPC signal as having opted out of what CCPA calls a “sale” of any California personal information that is collected on that site from that browser using cookies and similar technology. You can override that treatment for a GPC-enabled browser by using the cookie controls available from the website’s footer.  
  
Opting out of “sales” and “sharing” limits only some types of disclosures of personal information, and there are exceptions to all of the rights described in this section.  
  
Please note that we do not “sell” or “share” personal information (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age.  
  
Retention  
  
We retain your information only for as long as is necessary to provide the Services and to fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other necessary purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests. The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information. For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes (including complying with legal requirement to maintain records of deletion requests). If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. We may retain cached or archived copies of your information.  
  
Your CCPA Information, Correction, Deletion, and Other Rights  
  
The CCPA allows you to request us to:  
  

* Inform you about the categories of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we have disclosed certain personal information, and more specific detail about what categories of information were “sold,” “shared” or disclosed to particular categories of third parties, similar to the detail above this section of the Privacy Statement;
* Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you;
* Correct certain personal information we have about you; and
* Delete certain personal information we have about you.  
      
    If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may submit your request via email to privacy@sonos.com and through our toll free number at 1-800-680-2345.  
      
    Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information to provide our services to you, so we may reject a deletion request for that information while providing services to you.  
      
    Verification of Requests to Exercise CCPA Rights  
      
    We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to your request, which may include, depending on the sensitivity of the information involved, the nature of our relationship with you, and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, email address, and other information regarding your use of our services.  
      
    Requests Made by Agents  
      
    You can designate an authorized agent to make a CCPA request on your behalf. To do so, we must receive a legally sufficient power of attorney signed by you pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4121 to 4130, or other written authorization acceptable to us, for the agent to act on your behalf. You may still need to verify your identity and confirm the agent’s authority directly with us if we are not convinced of the validity of the agent’s request. For security and legal reasons, we may refuse to accept requests that require us to visit an agent’s website. Because opt-out requests for sales made through cookies and related technology must be performed from each browser that is used to access our services, it is easiest for the consumer to perform such opt-outs themselves. However, if you wish for an agent to perform browser-based requests on your behalf, you may arrange for the agent to your consumer’s browser to make such requests, but you may not share your login credentials or logged-in access to our websites with an agent or any other third party. We are not responsible for the security risks of giving an agent browser access or any other arrangements that you may have with an agent.  
      
    Nondiscrimination  
      
    You also have a right not to receive “discriminatory treatment” (within the meaning of the CCPA) for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.  
      
    NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES  
      
    We may offer incentives, such as a coupon or discount on purchase in exchange for personal information (e.g., email sign-up). We may also offer a loyalty program that will provide certain perks, such as rewards and exclusive offers, as well as other programs like sweepstakes or contests. We generally do not assign monetary or other value to personal information. If, however, we are required by law to assign such value, we have valued the personal information collected and used based in part on the value of consumer trial of new products and sharing future offers tailored to your interest with competitive value. The value is a practical and good-faith effort often involving the (i) categories of personal information collected (e.g., names, email addresses), (ii) the transferability of such personal information for us, (iii) the discounted price offered, (iv) the volume of consumers enrolled in our programs, and (v) the product or service to which the programs, or price or service differences, applies. The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards.
