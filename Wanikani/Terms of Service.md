The WaniKani Terms of Service
-----------------------------

Effective date: May 25, 2023

### A. Definitions

**Short version:** _We use these basic terms throughout the Agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There’s not going to be a test on it, but it’s still useful information._

1. “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the “Terms”) and all other operating rules, policies (including the WaniKani Privacy Policy, available at [wanikani.com/privacy](https://www.wanikani.com/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.
2. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, audio, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. “Content” also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Your Content” is Content that you create or own.
3. “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Tofugu.
4. “Tofugu,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Tofugu, LLC., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
5. “User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See [Section B.4): Additional Terms](#b-account-terms)).
6. “Website” or “WaniKani” refers to Tofugu’s website located at [wanikani.com](https://www.wanikani.com/), and all content, Services, and products provided by Tofugu at or through the Website. It also refers to Tofugu-owned subdomains of wanikani.com, such as [api.wanikani.com](https://api.wanikani.com/). Occasionally, Websites owned by Tofugu may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or Service.

### B. Account Terms

**Short version:** _A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; and you must provide a valid email address. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure._

#### 1\. Required Information

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid account](#i-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

#### 2\. Account Requirements

We have a few simple rules for accounts on WaniKani’s Service.

* You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young people excited to learn Japanese, we must comply with United States law. WaniKani does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s account immediately](#j-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* You may not use as a username that is a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity without appropriate authorization. You may not use a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar, or obscene.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.

#### 3\. User Account Security

You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account.
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. WaniKani cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly [notify WaniKani](mailto:hello@wanikani.com) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.

#### 4\. Additional Terms

In some situations, third parties’ terms may apply to your use of WaniKani. For example, you may download an application that integrates with WaniKani. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties’ terms govern their relationships with you.

### C. Acceptable Use

**Short version:** _While using the Service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the Service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other._

#### 1\. Compliance with Laws and Regulations

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

#### 2\. Content Restrictions

You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:

* is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;
* is or contains sexually obscene content;
* is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;
* is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;
* contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or
* infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.

#### 3\. Conduct Restrictions

While using WaniKani, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:

* harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including Tofugu employees, officers, and agents, or other WaniKani Users;
* use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;
* attempt to disrupt or tamper with Tofugu’s servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on Tofugu’s servers through automated means, or to access Tofugu’s Service in ways that exceed your authorization;
* impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with Tofugu, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site’s purpose; or
* violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person’s personal information without consent.

#### 4\. Services Usage Limits

You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without Tofugu’s express written permission.

#### 5\. Scraping

Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through WaniKani’s API. Please see [Section G](#g-api-terms) for our API Terms. You may scrape the Website for the following reasons:

* Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from WaniKani for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.
* Archivists may scrape WaniKani for public data for archival purposes.

You may not scrape WaniKani for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling WaniKani users’ personal information, such as to advertisers, recruiters, or job boards.

All use of WaniKani data gathered through scraping must comply with the [WaniKani Privacy Policy](https://www.wanikani.com/privacy).

#### 6\. Privacy

Misuse of WaniKani Users’ Personal Information is prohibited.

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from WaniKani must comply with the [WaniKani Privacy Policy](https://www.wanikani.com/privacy), particularly in regards to the collection of our Users’ Personal Information (as defined in the [WaniKani Privacy Policy](https://www.wanikani.com/privacy)). If you collect any WaniKani User’s Personal Information from WaniKani, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from WaniKani, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact” requests from Tofugu or WaniKani Users.

#### 7\. Excessive Bandwidth Use

If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other WaniKani customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your access until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

#### 8\. User Protection

You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.

### D. User-Generated Content

**Short version:** _You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the Service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to._

#### 1\. Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

#### 2\. Tofugu May Remove Content

We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Tofugu terms or policies.

#### 3\. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own (“Your Content”). If you’re posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other WaniKani Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4–D.5. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Tofugu the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4–D.5. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers.

#### 4\. License Grant to Us

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant Tofugu the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

#### 5\. Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this Agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Tofugu the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### E. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

If you believe that content on our Website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](#e-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on WaniKani violates your rights, please contact us by emailing [copyright@wanikani.com](mailto:copyright@wanikani.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We disable and terminate the accounts of users who may infringe upon the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Tofugu or others, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion.

### F. Intellectual Property Notice

**Short version:** _We own the Service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed._

#### 1\. Tofugu’s Rights to Content

Tofugu and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © Tofugu, LLC. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from Tofugu.

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/tofugu/wanikani-policies#license).

### G. API Terms

**Short version:** _You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section G, when using any of WaniKani’s APIs (Application Program Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses WaniKani._

No Abuse or Overuse of the API

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to WaniKani via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. Tofugu, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed WaniKani’s rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from WaniKani for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling WaniKani users’ personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the WaniKani API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [WaniKani Privacy Policy](https://www.wanikani.com/privacy).

Tofugu may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of Tofugu’s Service.

### H. Advertising on WaniKani

**Short version:** _We generally prohibit the use of WaniKani for advertising, so it does not become a spam haven. No one wants that._

Advertising Content is limited to the promotion of personal projects or personal professional development. Any advertising for a business entity is prohibited without approval by Tofugu.

Any Advertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, such as the restrictions on appropriate use of WaniKani. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any Tofugu terms or policies.

### I. Payment

**Short version:** _You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of WaniKani. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change._

#### 1\. Pricing

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [wanikani.com/account/subscription](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term. Decreases in a subscription price may be applied in the middle of a payment term.

#### 2\. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change your level of service, we will prorate the cost difference and apply any charges or discounts immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your [subscription settings](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription). If you choose to downgrade your account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your account.

#### 3\. Billing Schedule; Refunds

* For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively. For lifetime plans, the Service is billed once at time of purchase.
* Refunds may be requested within 60 days of payment for any level of service, for any reason.

By using the Service, you agree to pay Tofugu any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, [contact our support team](mailto:hello@wanikani.com). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid accounts. Free accounts are not required to provide payment information.

### J. Cancellation and Termination

**Short version:** _You may close your account at any time. If you do, we’ll treat your information responsibly._

#### 1\. Account Cancellation

You can cancel your subscription at any time via the [subscription settings](https://www.wanikani.com/account/subscription). Your access to paid content and features will remain in effect until the end of your current billing period. At the end of the billing period, access to paid content and features will be revoked, though your account will still be accessible and you can re-subscribe at any time. As part of keeping your account accessible, we will retain your data indefinitely, or until such time that you request an account deletion.

#### 2\. Account Deletion

It is your responsibility to properly delete your account with WaniKani. You can [delete your account at any time](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/danger_zone) by going into your settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen and then navigating to the “Danger Zone” section. The Danger Zone screen provides a simple account deletion link, though email confirmation of the action is required. We are not able to delete accounts in response to an email or phone request.

#### 3\. Upon Deletion

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our Agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile immediately. Note that some information may remain in secure backups. This information can not be recovered once your account is deleted.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to the community forums, but it will be publicly anonymized.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing account contents before account cancellation, deletion, termination, or downgrade.

#### 4\. Tofugu May Terminate

Tofugu has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. Tofugu reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### O. Changes to These Terms

**Short version:** _We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren’t that important — we don’t want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this Agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them._

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.
