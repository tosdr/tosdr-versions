#### What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

The Application does not provide an option to create an account therefore, we do not store nor have access to your entries and data. **Your data are stored only locally on your device and all calculations are done on your device as well**. You can optionally backup your data to Google Drive (Android) or to Apple iCloud (iOS). Your backups are stored in your private cloud space and we donâ€™t have access to your backup files.

We obtain your email address when you request support via email or customer support contact form. We use your email only to contact you to provide support, feedback or important information.

#### Backup

We advise our users to regularly backup their data. Our users can choose to manually export the backup file and store it wherever they want or they can optionally make cloud backups. The cloud backups are kept in users' private cloud space where we have no access.

**Android Google Drive Backups**

Android users can optionally backup their data using Google Drive. Their backups are stored in their private Google Drive space and count against their quota. We use a secure connection to your Google Account and data is safely stored in a folder where we nor other apps have access.Â View Google Privacy Policy at [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)

The email and name permissions within the Android are requested in order to display the account details within the app to inform users about the account which is being used for the backups. The app does not keep email addresses and names within the app. The app asks Google Sign In for a connected account and displays the account info only when accessing the Backup section. Even if the user agreed to anonymous analytics data collection your email address or name is never sent with the analytics data.

**iOS iCloud Backups**

iOS users can optionally backup their data usingÂ iCloud Drive. Their backups are stored in their private iCloud Drive space and count against their quota. iCloud secures your information by encrypting it when it's in transit, storing it in iCloud in an encrypted format, and using secure tokens for authentication. For certain sensitive information, Apple uses end-to-end encryption. This means that only you can access your information, andÂ only on devices where youâ€™re signed into iCloud. No one else, not even Apple, can access end-to-end encrypted information.Â You can find out more about iCloud security and privacy overview at [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303)

  

### **Apple Health Integration**

You may opt-in to integrate the app with Apple Health. If you grant the app access to Apple Health, the app will import your data from Apple Health into the Application. The app cannot read from Apple Health unless you grant access.Â **Data accessed from Apple Health will never be shared with third parties, such as third-party service providers and/or advertisers.**

The app is in no way responsible for the protection of the Health Data and/or other information stored with Apple Health. You and Apple are solely responsible for protecting such information in Apple Health. Please review Apple's applicable policies and procedures before syncing and backing up your Health Data and/or other information with Apple Health.
