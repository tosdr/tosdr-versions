Why millions of people are using TunnelBear
-------------------------------------------

### Stop password and data theft

Hackers can steal passwords and data over insecure public WiFi. TunnelBear blocks them to keep you secure.

### Access global content

Some content is only available in certain regions. TunnelBear changes your virtual location so you can see it anywhere.

### Bypass local censorship

Some governments block popular websites and apps. TunnelBear unblocks them by changing your virtual location.

### Protect your online privacy

Network owners and internet providers can see everything you do online. With TunnelBear on, they can't see a thing.

### Prevent IP-based tracking

Ad services use your IP address to track your behaviour across sites. TunnelBear stops them by assigning you a new IP.

### And way, way more

Play on new game servers, prevent speed throttling, and unblock apps and websites on school and work networks.
