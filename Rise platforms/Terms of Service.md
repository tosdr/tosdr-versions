The award passed by the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on both the parties. Nothing contained herein shall prevent us from applying to any court of law in order to obtain injunctions, equitable relief or any equivalent remedy, against the other Party, in order to restrain the breach of any covenants pursuant to these Terms. The arbitration award shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any motion to enforce or vacate an arbitration award under this agreement shall be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible.

Our failure to take action or enforce any rights against you in the event of any violation under the Terms shall not be constructed as a waiver of such rights. The Terms and any right granted herein may not be assigned by you without receiving our prior written consent. Nothing in the Terms will be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and us.
