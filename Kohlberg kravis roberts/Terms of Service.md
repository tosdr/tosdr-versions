This Site does not provide specific investing advice or strategies to any individual or entity. The investments and strategies discussed in the Content may not be suitable for all investors and are not obligations of or guaranteed by KKR. The investments are not bank deposits and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other entity and are subject to investment risks, including the loss of the principal amount invested. Nothing contained on the Site constitutes investment, legal, tax or other advice nor is to be relied on in making an investment or other decision. Decisions based on the Content are the sole responsibility of the user. If you would like investment, accounting, tax or legal advice, you should consult with your own financial advisors, accountants or attorneys regarding your individual circumstances and needs. You agree that KKR is not liable for any action you take or decision you make in reliance on any Content. KKR will not treat users of the Site as its partners, clients, customers or investors by virtue of their accessing the Site.

Actual realized value of currently unrealized investments will depend on, among other factors, the value of the investments and market conditions at the time of disposition, related transaction costs, and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ from the assumptions and circumstances on which the currently unrealized valuations are based. Accordingly, the actual realized values of unrealized investments may differ materially from the values indicated herein.
