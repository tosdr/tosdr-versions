#### Purchase Policy

The following terms and conditions (this “**Purchase Policy**”), which are expressly incorporated into, and made part of, these Terms of Use, apply to the purchase of Coins, the use of Coins to redeem Digital Goods within the Store, and the purchase of Subscription Services. For the avoidance of doubt, all purchasers of Coins, redeemers of Digital Goods, and/or purchasers of Subscription Services are considered Users, and are required to have an active Account in good standing.

_Coins_

Coins are virtual currency that can only be used to redeem Digital Goods within the Store as further described in the “Digital Goods” subsection below. Coins cannot be used, bought, or sold outside of the Store, or transferred among Users, have no real-world monetary value, and are illiquid and not convertible or exchangeable whatsoever into cash or fiat money or cryptocurrency or other digital currencies. Users are able to purchase Coins through the Essential™ Mod by following the in-game prompts to a one time use web checkout page powered by the Payment Processor, subject to the “Payments for Coins and Subscription Services and Purchase Agreement” subsection below. Prices for Coins are listed at the point of purchase in U.S. Dollars (USD), are subject to change at any time, and may differ from prices advertised by Essential elsewhere at various times or quoted by Essential customer service from time to time. Once a User completes their transaction, the purchased Coins will appear in their Account and then may be used to redeem Digital Goods within the Store.

If Essential no longer operates or maintains the Service or the Store, then the Coins that a User has purchased may no longer be redeemable for Digital Goods or serve their intended purpose at the time of purchase and may ultimately be forfeited or lost.

_Digital Goods_

Digital Goods are displayed within the Store and are only redeemable with Coins purchased as described above in the “Coins” subsection above. All Digital Goods are considered Platform Content and accordingly owned by Essential and, when and as redeemed by a User through the Store, are solely licensed to that User in accordance with the terms of the Service License; redeeming Digital Goods with purchased Coins does not transfer ownership or confer any ownership rights in the Digital Goods. Digital Goods cannot be used, bought, or sold outside of the Store, or transferred among Users, and have no real-world monetary value.

Users are able to redeem Digital Goods in exchange for a specific number of Coins as displayed at the point of redemption within the Store. Redemption prices for Digital Goods are subject to change at any time and may differ from prices advertised by Essential elsewhere at various times or quoted by Essential customer service from time to time. Once a User completes their transaction, the Coins are debited from their balance and the Digital Goods will appear in their wardrobe.

Essential makes every effort to display Digital Goods and their functionalities, qualities, and attributes, such as their colors, sizes, textures, and appearance, as accurately as possible on the Service. However, you should be aware that the displayed qualities and attributes of Digital Goods depend upon a variety of factors out of Essential’s control, including users’ monitor or mobile device screen resolution, physical environment while viewing or using Digital Goods through the Service, and other factors, so Essential cannot guarantee that the qualities and attributes of Digital Goods will always be accurately portrayed on the Service. If you have any questions about any of the qualities and attributes of any specific Digital Goods, please do not hesitate to email Essential at [requests@essential.gg](mailto:requests@essential.gg).

Not all Digital Goods displayed or advertised in the Store from time to time may always be available for redemption. Essential may, at any time and from time to time, for any reason in its sole discretion, limit the quantity of certain Digital Goods that may be redeemed by all Users or any single User at one time and/or discontinue certain Digital Goods. Sometimes you may add a Digital Good to your cart but, by the time you check out and your order processes, that Digital Good may no longer be available for redemption; if that happens, Essential will automatically reject the redemption and the corresponding Coins for that Digital Good will not be deducted from your balance.

If Essential no longer operates or maintains the Service, the Store, and/or a particular Digital Goods, then the Digital Good(s) that a User has redeemed through the Store may no longer be operational or serve their intended purpose at the time of redemption and may ultimately be forfeited or lost.

_Subscription Services_

Essential may, from time to time, sell one or more Subscription Services that include certain Essential products and services in exchange for a recurring fee as further described on the Website (as amended from time to time, the “**Subscription Offering Terms**”), which are subject to change at any time without prior notice.

The Subscription Offering Terms will describe, among other things, the products and services included within the relevant Subscription Service, the price for the relevant Subscription Service and the frequency with which payment will be due (e.g., monthly, annual, etc.), any promotional pricing or offers for the Subscription Service, and any special terms, conditions, or restrictions. In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and any Subscription Offering Terms, the Subscription Offering Terms will control, but solely with respect to that Subscription Service and no other Subscription Service.

Users are able to purchase Subscription Services through the Essential™ Mod by following the in-game prompts to a web interface powered by the Payment Processor, subject to the “Payments for Coins and Subscription Services and Purchase Agreement” subsection below. Prices for Subscription Services are listed in the Subscription Offering Terms and the point of purchase in U.S. Dollars (USD), are subject to change at any time, and may differ from prices advertised by Essential elsewhere at various times or quoted by Essential customer service from time to time.

Subscription Services continue and automatically renew at the price and on the periodic payment basis advertised in the Subscription Offering Terms (or, if none specified, then on a monthly basis) until you cancel the Subscription Service or Essential discontinues the relevant Subscription Service, whichever is earlier.

To cancel a Subscription Service, either go to [https://checkout.tebex.io/payment-history/login](https://checkout.tebex.io/payment-history/login) and login using the email address you used to subscribe and navigate to the subscriptions tab, or email Essential at [requests@essential.gg](mailto:requests@essential.gg). Cancellation is also possible by opening Minecraft using your account that is linked to an Essential subscription, navigate to manage “Club” Modal - manage your subscription, and login using the email address you used to subscribe. Cancellation is effective at the end of the then-current billing period, and you will continue to have access to your Subscription Service benefits until such date, at which point your Subscription Services, and the benefits received in connection therewith, will expire.

From time to time, Essential will offer Subscription Services at promotional rates. Those offers are not transferable, may not be combined with any past, present, or future offers or promotions, may not be available in all jurisdictions, may be limited-time offers, and/or may only be available to new subscribers.

_Errors or Inaccuracies in Pricing, Information, and Descriptions_

Essential is not responsible for typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions on the Service pertaining to Coins, Digital Goods, and Subscription Services and their availability, price, or product descriptions, qualities, or attributes. As a result, Essential does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information on the Service, including prices, product images, specifications, and/or availability. Essential reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update information at any time without prior notice.

_Payments for Coins and Subscription Services and Purchase Agreement_

To purchase Coins or a Subscription Service, you will be asked to supply Essential and/or its third-party payment processor (presently, Tebex Limited) (as updated from time to time, the “**Payment Processor**”) with certain information relevant to your transaction, including, without limitation, your name and Minecraft UUID, your email address where Essential or the Payment Processor can send you a receipt and information about your purchase, information about your form of payment (i.e., credit card, payment card, Gift Certificate (as defined below), or other payment method and the expiration date and security/CVV code, if applicable), the billing address associated with such form of payment, and other information relevant to your purchase (collectively, “**Transaction Information**”), and Essential may need to share that Transaction Information with certain third-party Persons to complete your order as further described in the Privacy Policy. If you decline to provide Essential or the Payment Processor with Transaction Information as Essential or the Payment Processor deems necessary, or do not wish to permit Essential or the Payment Processor to share Transaction Information with any third-party fulfillment service providers, then Essential and/or the Payment Processor may refuse or be unable to process the order or, if already processed, Essential may cancel the order and issue (or direct the Payment Processor to issue) a refund to your original form of payment (to the extent payment has been processed).

YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARDS, GIFT CERTIFICATES, OR PAYMENT CARDS OR OTHER PAYMENT METHODS USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PURCHASES YOU MAKE THROUGH THE SERVICE AND TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL WITH ALL RELATED TRANSACTION INFORMATION.

You agree to pay all fees and charges that may be incurred by you or on your behalf through the Service (including through your Account), at the prices and amounts in effect when such fees and charges are incurred and you authorize Essential and the Payment Processor to charge all applicable amounts for the orders that you make to the credit card, Gift Certificate, payment card, or other payment method specified at the time the order is placed. In addition, you remain responsible for any taxes that may be applicable to your purchases of Coins or Subscription Services. When purchase a Subscription Service, Essential or the Payment Processor will continue to charge, on a monthly basis (or other periodic basis, if any, specified in the Subscription Offering Terms), the credit card, Gift Certificate, payment card, or other payment method specified at the time the order is placed or otherwise updated within your Account from time to time until you cancel your Subscription Service in the manner set forth in the “Subscription Services” subsection above or Essential discontinues the relevant Subscription Service, whichever is earlier.

Please contact the Payment Processor directly by visiting [https://www.tebex.io/support-customer](https://www.tebex.io/support-customer) if you require assistance with payments made, or to be made, with respect to the purchase of any Coins or Subscription Services, have any difficulty using the Payment Processor’s web interface for collecting and processing payments, or need to report fraudulent purchases or charges. Essential will not be able to provide any customer support or technical assistance.

_Refund Policy_

All purchases of Coins, redemptions of Digital Goods, and purchases of Subscription Services are final (subject to a User’s right to cancel future cycles of a Subscription as described in the “Subscription Services” subsection above). Refunds are solely at the discretion of Essential and/or the Payment Processor (where applicable). Refunds will not be issued to any User whose access to the Service is denied, suspended, or terminated due to a breach of these Terms of Use, Additional Terms, or any policies, terms, or conditions of the Payment Processor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Users who are citizens or residents of the European Economic Area (collectively, “**EU Users**”) and who make purchases through the Service have the legal right of withdrawal on software sales. Per Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights, EU Users may withdraw from a contract for digital content purchased online and receive a full refund therefore within fourteen (14) days of an EU User’s purchase thereof. However, a service provider may exclude this right of withdrawal from a contract for digital content that has started performing, where an EU User has given prior consent to start the service during the right of withdrawal period. By purchasing Coins, redeeming Digital Goods, and/or purchasing Subscription Services, you provide Essential with your express consent to start the applicable service, and you hereby waive your right of withdrawal pursuant to Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights.

_Limitations on Purchases_

Essential reserves the right to place limits on or otherwise regulate purchases of Coins, redemptions of Digital Goods, and purchases of Subscription Services. Essential may limit, cancel, or prohibit any orders of Coins, Digital Goods, or Subscription Services, including, without limitation, for pricing errors, actual or suspected violation of this Purchase Policy, or actual suspected fraudulent activity.

Essential does not authorize the purchase of commercial quantities of Coins or redemption of commercial quantities of Digital Goods and reserve the right to, in Essential’s sole discretion, prohibit transactions by resellers, dealers, and distributors.

In the event Essential refuses any orders placed through the Service, Essential will not charge (or direct the Payment Processor not to charge) the form of payment you originally provided. In the event Essential limits or cancels, in whole or in part, any orders placed through the Service, Essential will issue (or direct the Payment Processor to issue) a refund to your original form of payment (to the extent payment has been processed) for the portion of the canceled order.

_Gift Certificates_

Essential may, from time to time, sell or issue Essential-branded gift certificates, gift cards, merchandise cards, rewards cards, vouchers, store credit cards, or other stored value products, whether in physical or electronic form, redeemable only to purchase Coins and/or Subscription Services or as a Store credit balance to your Account to redeem Digital Goods (as the case may be) (each, a “**Gift Certificate**”), subject to the following terms and conditions:

* Gift Certificates are issued and administered by either Essential or a third-party Person specified at the time of issuance, which will have the sole responsibility for those Gift Certificates and their operation and maintenance.
* Gift Certificates are only valid if obtained from Essential. Essential does not honor gift certificates, gift cards, merchandise cards, rewards cards, vouchers, store credit cards, or other stored value products issued by Mojang AB or Microsoft Corporation, even if they relate to the Minecraft® game, unless explicitly stated by Essential.
* Gift Certificates are redeemable only for Coins, Digital Goods, and/or Subscription Services (as indicated on or in connection with the Gift Certificate), directly from Essential, at the time of redemption/purchase. A Gift Certificate for a Store credit used to redeem Digital Goods may only be redeemed once and will be considered redeemed once the monetary value has been credited to the Account of the recipient (designated by the purchasing User), which is necessary for redemption.
* Gift Certificates have no cash value and may not be redeemed for cash except as required by Applicable Law. Gift Certificates are not redeemable to purchase another Gift Certificate or towards previously-purchased Coins, previously-redeemed Digital Goods, or previously-purchased Subscription Services. Gift Certificates are non-returnable or refundable except where required by Applicable Law.
* Gift Certificates may be transferred or given to another User, but may not be sold or resold.
* In most cases, the balance of a Gift Certificate is adjusted immediately at the time it is used to make a purchase, though there may be instances where the balance adjustment is delayed.
* Gift Certificates do not expire except as may be permitted by Applicable Law.
* Lost, stolen, or damaged Gift Certificates will not be replaced. Essential will have no liability for lost or stolen Gift Certificates or the unauthorized use of any Gift Certificate.

Essential may set additional or differing terms and conditions for specific Gift Certificate, which will be specified at the time of issuance; in the event of a conflict between the foregoing terms and conditions and any Gift Certificate-specific term or condition, the later-issued terms and conditions will apply. Essential may modify the foregoing terms and conditions, or any Gift Certificate-specific term or condition, at any time in the manner provided in these Terms of Use or otherwise with notice to the Gift Certificate holder.

_Promotional or Discounts Codes_

Essential may, at any time and from time to time, for any reason in its sole discretion, create promotional or discount codes that may either discount the purchase price for Coins, redemption price for certain Digital Goods, or purchase price certain Subscription Services or be redeemed for credit in your Account or for other features or benefits related to the Services (collectively, “**Promo Codes**”), subject to any additional terms that Essential establishes on a per-promotion or per-Promo Code basis. Promo Codes may only be used, and its associated benefits or discounts may be redeemed, only once per User or Account and/or once per transaction. Essential reserves the right to void Promo Codes for duplicate benefits. Only Promo Codes sent to Users through Automatic Communications, Voluntary Communications, or other communications directly from Essential to you are valid and will be honored. You understand and agree that Promo Codes (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose and in accordance with Applicable Law and these Terms of Use; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold, or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public forum or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by Essential; (iii) may be disabled by Essential, at any time and from time to time, for any reason in its sole discretion, without liability to Essential; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that Essential establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not redeemable for cash, Gift Certificates, or cash equivalents except where redeemable for Coins; and (vi) may expire prior to your use and, if that happens, Essential may decline to reissue a replacement Promo Code.

_Customer-Provided Ratings, Comments, and Feedback_

To the extent the Service functionalities allow for Users to submit, upload, post, or transmit ratings, reviews, comments, or feedback pertaining to Coins, Digital Goods, and/or Subscription Services (collectively, “**Product Reviews**”) in Interactive Areas or elsewhere, those Product Reviews constitute User Content and may be displayed on the Service pursuant to the User Content License.

#### Claims Of Copyright Infringement And The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)

Essential avails itself of the protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S. Code § 512 (as may be amended from time to time, the “**DMCA**”) and will treat User Content that allegedly infringes a Person’s copyright in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth therein and in these Terms of Use.

_Designated Agent for Receiving Notices of Claimed Copyright Infringement and Counter Notices_

Essential has designated an agent with the United States Copyright Office in accordance with the DMCA (the “**Designated Agent**”) and all notices of claimed copyright infringement and counter notices to Essential provided pursuant to the DMCA should be sent to:

ModCore Inc. Attention: DMCA Designated Agent Leopoldstr. 2-8 32051 Herford Germany

[dmca@essential.gg](mailto:dmca@essential.gg)

_Notice of Claimed Copyright Infringement:_ If the owner of a copyrighted work or its agent of a copyrighted work (each, a “**Copyright Claimant**”) believes, in good faith, that any User Content infringes such copyrighted work under Applicable Law, such Copyright Claimant may provide the Designated Agent with a written notice containing the following in accordance with the DMCA:

* The Copyright Claimant’s name, address, telephone number, and email address;
* A description of the copyrighted work that the Copyright Claimant claims has been infringed;
* A description of where within the Service the User Content that the Copyright Claimant claims is infringing may be found, sufficient for Essential to locate the allegedly infringing User Content;
* A statement that the Copyright Claimant has a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted work is not authorized by the copyright owner or its agent or by Applicable Law;
* A statement by you under penalty of perjury under Applicable Law that the information in your notice of claimed copyright infringement is accurate and that the Copyright Claimant is the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf; and
* The Copyright Claimant’s electronic or physical signature.

If the Designated Agent receives notice of claimed copyright infringement in a manner that complies with the above requirements and the DMCA, Essential will respond expeditiously by removing, or disabling access to, the User Content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity. Failure to include all of the above information, especially specific information about where infringing User Content may be found, will result in a delay in the processing of your notice of claimed copyright infringement and may result in your having to repeat some or all of the above process.

Essential will also comply with the appropriate provisions of the DMCA in the event a counter notice is received as described below.

Applicable Law imposes substantial penalties for falsely submitting a notice of copyright infringement.

_Counter Notice to Restore User Content Removed for Alleged Copyright Infringement:_ If a User believes that its User Content has been removed by mistake or misidentification, that User dispute the removal by providing Essential with a written counter notice containing the following information in accordance with the DMCA:

* The User’s name, address, telephone number, and email address;
* A description of its User Content that was removed from the Service;
* A description of where within the Service the User Content that was removed previously appeared;
* A statement that the User has a good faith belief that its User Content was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification;
* A statement by the User under penalty of perjury under Applicable Law that the information in your counter notice is accurate;
* A statement that the User consents to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, the United States District Court for Southern District of New York, and that you will accept service of process from the Person who filed the original notice of claimed copyright infringement or an agent of that Person; and
* The User’s electronic or physical signature.

After the Designated Agent receives your counter notice, Essential will forward it, including any Personal Information contained therein, to the Copyright Claimant who submitted the original notice of claimed copyright infringement and to such other Persons as permitted or required by Applicable Law. After Essential forwards your counter notice, the Copyright Claimant must then notify Essential within ten (10) days that they have filed a Claim seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to your User Content or other material on the Service. Essential will not restore the disputed User Content if it receives such notice from the Copyright Claimant. Essential may, but is not required to, restore the disputed User Content if it does not receive such notice from the Copyright Claimant.

If you reside outside of the United States of America, please understand that filing a counter notice may lead to legal proceedings between you and the Copyright Claimant to determine ownership of the copyrighted material that is subject to the notice of claimed copyright infringement, which could result in legal consequences in your country and/or the United States of America.

_Repeat Infringer Policy_

Essential enforces a policy that provides for the denial, suspension, or termination in appropriate circumstances of Accounts and access privileges for Users whose User Content repeatedly infringes other Persons’ copyrights.

_Liability for Making False DMCA Claims or Counter Notices_

Under the DMCA, any Person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability, including, without limitation, monetary damages. If you are not sure whether certain User Content infringes your copyright or the copyrights of others or whether to file a counter notice in response to a claim of copyright infringement, Essential suggests that you first contact a licensed attorney. ESSENTIAL IS NOT YOUR ATTORNEY, AND THE INFORMATION PRESENTED HERE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND NOT AS LEGAL ADVICE. CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN ATTORNEY REGARDING ANY DMCA CLAIMS.
