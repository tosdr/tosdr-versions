You agree that you shall have no recourse against Essential for any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary or other right in or related to the User Content. You acknowledge and agree that your submitting, uploading, posting, or transmitting of User Content in or to the Platform does not create any new or alter any existing relationship between you and Essential.

You acknowledge and agree that submissions of User Content to Interactive Areas may be publicly available to other Users or, in certain cases, specific other Users, and that you will be publicly identified by your real name or screen name/player profile (i.e., Minecraft Unique User Identifier ("**Minecraft UUID**")) when communicating in Interactive Areas, and Essential will not be responsible for the action of any Users with respect to any information or materials posted in Interactive Areas.

* A description of where on the Platform the allegedly infringing Platform IP or User Content may be found, sufficient for Essential to locate the material;
* A statement that the Trademark Claimant has a good faith belief that the use of the registered Trademark is not authorized by the owner, registrant, or licensee thereof or their respective agents, or applicable law;
* A statement by the Trademark Claimant under penalty of perjury under applicable law that the information in your notice is accurate and that the Trademark Claimant is the Trademark owner, registrant, or licensee or authorized to act on their behalf; and

If such User believes the User Content should not have been removed, that User can follow up with the rights holder (i.e., the Trademark Claimant) directly to try to resolve the issue. Essential does not provide a counter-notice or appeal mechanisms for claims of Trademark infringement and disclaims any liability for claims any User might make regarding mistaken or misidentified Trademark infringement notice and takedown requests.

Essential reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without notice or liability to you, to investigate complaints or reported violations of the Terms of Use and to take any action Essential deems appropriate, including, without limitation, reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third-party Persons, or suspending or terminating your use of, or access to, the Platform (either in whole or in part) at any time for any reason with any conditions, including, without limitation, if Essential believes in good faith that you have violated or acted inconsistently with these Terms of Use or any applicable law or the Minecraft Terms, or that you have engaged in conduct that Essential determines, in its sole discretion, to be inappropriate or unacceptable. In connection with the investigation or reporting thereof, Essential reserves the right to disclose any information, including, without limitation, a User's Personal Information and usage of the Platform, as Essential deems necessary or appropriate to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third-party Persons.

Essential also reserves the right, at Essential's sole discretion, to seek and obtain any other remedies available to Essential pursuant to any applicable laws and regulations or at equity as a result of your breach of these Terms of Use or any other act or omission by you that gives rise to a legal claim or legal action by Essential. In the event your right to use the Platform terminated, limited, or suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect and enforceable against you.

You may terminate these Terms of Use at any time by ceasing all use of the Platform and Platform Content; provided, however, that all sections of these Terms of Use which by their nature should survive the expiration or termination shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding the expiration or termination of these Terms of Use.

#### Third-Party Content and Products

The Platform may include, and provides Users the functionality within Interactive Areas to submit, upload, post, or transmit their own User Content that may include, embedded third-party content or links (such as hyperlinks) to third-party websites, products, or services (including external websites that are framed by the Platform as well as any advertisements displayed in connection therewith) that are not owned or controlled by Essential (collectively, "**Third-Party Content**"). Third-Party Content is provided as an information service, for Users' reference and convenience only. Essential does not control any such Third-Party Content and is not responsible for their (i) availability or accuracy, (ii) content, advertising, or products or services, or (iii) infringing nature.

Additionally, the Platform may enable Users to purchase certain goods and services from third-party Persons ("**Third-Party Products**"), in which case Third-Party Terms, and not these Terms of Use, will apply to your use of that third-party merchant's website and purchase of such Third-Party Products.

Inclusion of any Third-Party Content or Third-Party Products on the Platform does not constitute or indicate Essential's endorsement thereof and Essential shall not be liable or responsible for any Third-Party Content transmitted through the Platform or Third-Party Products displayed on the Platform. You shall be subject to any additional terms and conditions of use, guidelines, rules, privacy policies, and other practices applicable to any Third-Party Content that you access through the Platform ("**Third-Party Terms**").

By using the Platform, you expressly release and hold Essential harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any Third-Party Content or purchase of any Third-Party Product, including any Losses (defined below) incurred as a result of any dealings between you and any third-party Persons, or as the result of the presence of such Third-Party Content or Third-Party Product on the Platform or the failure of such Third-Party Content or Third-Party Product to function as intended. It is your responsibility to evaluate the content and usefulness of the information obtained from third-party Persons.

#### User Accounts

In order to utilize certain full functionalities of the Platform, each User may need to register and create an Account. You agree to create only one (1) unique Account and that you shall be the sole authorized user of your Account. As part of the registration process, Users will be asked to submit certain information, such as your email address, screen name/player profile/Minecraft UUID,and password, and to create an Account login password (collectively, "**Registration Data**"). You agree that all Registration Data you provide to Essential will be, and remain at all times, true, accurate, current, and complete. Essential may from time to time modify or add to the Registration Data information fields required to create an Account, and you agree to promptly complete any such additional or modified information fields when and as requested by Essential.

Essential is not responsible for any Losses as a result of another User or Person using your Account, Registration Data, or password, with or without your knowledge.

#### Information Relating to Children

The Platform is not directed to children under the ages of thirteen (13), and Essential does not knowingly collect, use, or disclose Personal Information from (i) children under the age of thirteen (13) or (ii) children between the age of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18) (or any other applicable age required to be deemed to have reached the ages of majority under the applicable law of the state or jurisdiction of such child's primary residence) that do not have parental or legal guardian consent to use the Platform. If Essential ever discovers that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information from a child under the age of thirteen (13) on or through the Platform, Essential will delete such Personal Information from our records as soon as possible.

If you are between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18) (or any other applicable age required to be deemed to have reached the ages of majority under the applicable law of the state or jurisdiction of your primary residence), you may register and become a registered User and maintain an Account on your own as long as you obtain your parent or legal guardian's consent prior to registering, and by continuing to use Essential, you represent and warrant that you have obtained that permission.

If you believe that we have Personal Information about, or have collected Personal Information from, (i) a child under the age of thirteen (13), or (ii) a child between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18) (or any other applicable age required to be deemed to have reached the age of majority under the applicable law of the state or jurisdiction of such child's primary residence) without parental or legal guardian consent, or that such child is using the Platform, please contact us at [contact@essential.gg](mailto:contact@essential.gg) to report the unauthorized use and registration and Essential will delete such Personal Information from our records as soon as possible and, if applicable, deactivate or delete such child's Account.

#### Cosmetic Store; Fees and Payments

Through the marketplace functionality within the Platform (the "**Store**"), Essential makes available certain first-party and third-party cosmetic modifications to the Minecraft® game (commonly referred to as "cosmetics") ("**Cosmetics**") for purchase by Users who are at least sixteen (16) years old. Each Cosmetic is considered Platform Content and accordingly owned by Essential and, when and as purchased by a User through the Store, licensed to that User in accordance with the terms of the Platform License.

All Cosmetics are virtual and have no value, and cannot be exchanged for real-world currency of any kind. For the avoidance of doubt, Essential's provision of the Store and sale of Cosmetics are subject to the terms and conditions of the Disclaimers section below, including that the Store and Cosmetics are provided to Users on an "as is" basis without express or implied warranties of any kind and that access to the Store and Cosmetics are not guaranteed to be uninterrupted or themselves error-free. If Essential no longer operates or maintains the Platform, the Store, and/or any Cosmetics, then the Cosmetics that a User has purchased through the Store may no longer be operational or serve their intended purpose at the time of purchase and may ultimately be forfeited or lost.

To purchase a Cosmetic through the Store, a User is required to establish an Account and shall pay all fees and charges, including all applicable taxes (including sales and use taxes and VAT), incurred through its Account at the price then-advertised on the listing for such Cosmetic in the Store (which may vary from time to time) when and as charged to the User or its Account by Essential's third-party payment processor, Tebex Limited (the "**Payment Processor**"), which facilitates all Store transactions through its checkout platform located at [https://checkout.tebex.io/](https://checkout.tebex.io/). The Payment Processor will detail accepted methods of payment, delivery times, fees and charges (including additional fees associated with, among other things, currency conversions, gateway fees, originator fees), and applicable taxes as part of the checkout process and, when you provide payment information to the Payment Processor, you represent and warrant that you are the authorized user of that method of payment (e.g., a credit card) and authorize the Payment Processor to charge such method of payment. The Payment Processor has complete control over transactions made through the Store and may decline any transaction for any reason it sees fit, including, but not limited to, potential fraudulent activity or your previous interactions with the Payment Processor. The payment information you submit when making a transaction through the Store will be collected and used by the Payment Process in accordance with its privacy polices and as further described in the [Privacy Policy](https://essential.gg/privacy-policy).

All transactions made through the Store are final. Refunds are solely at Essential and the Payment Processor's discretion. Refunds will not be issued to any User whose access to the Platform is denied, suspended, or terminated due to a breach of these Terms of Use or any policies of the Payment Processor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Users who are citizens or residents of the European Economic Area (the "**EU Users**") and who make purchases through the Store have the legal right of withdrawal on software sales, though content provided digitally, such as a Cosmetic, is excluded from this right once the content is provided to the end-user purchaser. This statutory right of withdrawal ends fourteen (14) days after such EU User purchases or, where the EU User has provided the appropriate consent and acknowledgement, the moment such EU User starts downloading the content and services for the first time, whichever is sooner. The statutory right of withdrawal is not applicable as regards the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the EU User's prior express consent and its acknowledgment that the EU User thereby loses its right of withdrawal. To exercise the right of withdrawal, an EU User must inform the Payment Processor of its decision in writing by email at [https://www.tebex.io/contact/checkout](https://www.tebex.io/contact/checkout) to withdraw from the purchase by an unequivocal statement before the withdrawal period has expired. If an EU User exercises its right of withdrawal, the Payment Processor will reimburse to such EU User all payments received from that EU User without undue delay and in any event not later than fourteen (14) days from the day on which the EU User provides such withdrawal notice to the Payment Processor. The Payment Processor will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as the EU User used for the initial transaction, unless it has expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, the EU User will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

If you require assistance processing a transaction through the Store, need to report fraudulent activity, or have any other questions or concerns, contact the Payment Processor at [https://www.tebex.io/contact/checkout](https://www.tebex.io/contact/checkout). Essential will not be able to provide any customer support or technical assistance.

To the extent any portions of the Platform or the Platform as a whole requires a subscription agreement and/or a prepaid fee, which may be modified from time to time in Essential's sole discretion, such prepaid fee, and all taxes and other fees related thereto, will be paid by each User in advance and in no event will a User be allowed access to the relevant portion of the Platform or Content for which a prepaid fee is required unless and until Essential receives all fees and charges payable by such User.

#### Advertisers on Platform

Advertisers and sponsors are responsible for ensuring that Content submitted for inclusion on the Platform is accurate and complies with applicable laws.
