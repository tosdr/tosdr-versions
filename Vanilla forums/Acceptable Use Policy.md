This Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) shall be deemed a part of and incorporated into the Service Provider Master Subscription Agreement by reference. By using the Service Provider Software Services, the Subscriber agrees, and shall require each of its Users to agree, to comply with this AUP. All determinations as to whether a Subscriber mailing or practice conforms to these rules will be determined by Service Provider in its sole reasonable discretion.

Service Provider reserves the right to modify this AUP from time to time in our sole discretion without notice; such changes will take effect upon the posting of such revised terms on this website. Accordingly, we recommend that Subscribers check this AUP periodically. Continued access or use of the Software Services after the posting of such revised terms constitutes agreement to comply with and commitment to be bound by such revised terms. In the event of any conflict between this AUP and any other policy or agreement referenced herein, this AUP shall govern in the absence of specific language to the contrary in such policy or agreement.
