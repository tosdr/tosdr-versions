Higher Logic Vanilla **FAQ**


--------------------------------

Why should I choose Higher Logic Vanilla for my online community tool?

Higher Logic Vanilla is the best-in-class community platform helping B2B and B2C companies create a digital place where their customers can access critical knowledge, get support, and connect with each other. We are community-first, meaning we only provide community, it is not an add-on to another solution and our team are experts in the space. Additionally, we were built to scale, so whether you are a small company or a large enterprise, Higher Logic Vanilla is equipped to help you succeed. 

What is Vanilla Forums?

Vanilla Forums is a Canadian software company founded in 2009 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was acquired by Higher Logic in 2021 and rebranded as Higher Logic Vanilla. 

How can online community support your customer success strategy?

One, it can help you centralize FAQs and resources to streamline customer onboarding. Two, it allows you to create a place where customers can access help docs and exchange best practices with their peers, driving product adoption and better outcomes. Lastly, it enables your customer success team to scale because they have a mechanism for facilitating 1:many relationships. Together these lead to a better customer experience and helps reduce churn. 

What is scaled customer success?

Instead of a team fielding individual customer requests, scaled customer success is 100% proactive. It is a set of programs designed to drive outcomes proactively, such as how to recognize time-to-value quickly, increase product or feature adoption, and drive lifetime value for both you AND your customers.    

How can I create a customer community?

It is likely you already have one! Online communities can look like Slack channels or LinkedIn groups for customers. However, to give your community a home, we recommend investing in a platform, like Higher Logic Vanilla. We can guide you through the steps of setting it up. 

How can I better engage B2B customers?

Community should be engrained in your customer experience. It’s the one place your customers go to find information about your product and connect with peers to share best practices. Posting product updates, relevant content, and events to draw them to the community is a great way to start getting your customers to engage. Gamifying your community with Higher Logic Vanilla’s ranking and rewards system can also help drive engagement! 

How can an online community increase product adoption?

Community helps you build a customer experience around your product. When your customers are part of a community of peers talking about best practices and seeing frequent product updates, they will be more aware of new features, and, in turn, more likely to adopt features and renew their subscription. Communities also create a place where you can host documentation, so customers can learn about your product and configure it to meet their needs.
