**_Your Release of Us_** — Unless otherwise provided under applicable law, if you have a dispute with another player, you release us (and our employees, officers, directors, agents, corporate parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures, and each of their respective legal representatives, successors, and assigns) from any claims, demands, losses, costs, liabilities, damages (indirect, actual, or consequential, including loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data), and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) of every kind and nature, whether known or unknown, expected or not expected, contingent or absolute, apparent or not apparent, that arise out of or relate to that dispute.

**_Waiver of California Civil Code Section 1542_** — If you reside in California, you acknowledge familiarity with California Civil Code §1542, a statute that otherwise prohibits the release of unknown claims, which provides as follows:

**A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.**

You (as the “credit or releasing party”) expressly agree to waive any rights you may have under Section 1542 or under laws of similar effect in any applicable jurisdictions.

1. **Report Conduct or User Content on the Services; Trademark & DMCA/Copyright Policy**
    

**_Report Conduct or User Content on the Services_** — If someone may have violated these Terms (including the Code of Conduct), misused the Services, posted inappropriate User Content, engaged in inappropriate activity, or distributed illegal content, or if you have any other issue you would like to raise with us, please let us know by using any links provided in the Services or by contacting Customer Support at support@peoplefun.com.

**_Trademark & DMCA/Copyright Policy_** — We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask that you do the same.  We respond to notices of alleged trademark or copyright infringement, consistent with the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act or laws of similar effect.  For more information, please review our [Copyright Page](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.peoplefun.com/copyright&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716210248486915&usg=AOvVaw2eD1Na1SDVRTQNFryPPPcr).  We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and without notice, to terminate any player’s access to the Services if we determine that the player may be a “repeat infringer.”

1. **In-Game Purchases, Virtual Items, and Payment Terms**
    

**_In-Game Purchases and Virtual Items_** — The Services do not require you to make any purchase of any kind.  The Services may include an opportunity to make in-game purchases or earn virtual, in-game items, including virtual coins, tokens, points, or other goods or services (collectively “Virtual Items”).  If you choose to purchase Virtual Items, you will be required to pay a fee using “real world” money to obtain a limited, personal, non-transferable, and revocable license and right to use these Virtual Items within the Services for your personal, non-commercial, and entertainment purposes only.  Virtual Items do not have an equivalent “real world” money value and can never be redeemed, transferred (to another user, between games, etc.), or cashed out for “real world” money, goods, or any other item of monetary value from us or any other party.  We offer Virtual Items only for additional entertainment value within our Services.    

You understand that pricing for Virtual Items may be dynamic and may vary over time and for different users.  In addition, you understand that while you may “earn,” “buy,” or “purchase” Virtual Items in our Services, you do not legally “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to “real” money or any credit balance in actual real-world currency.  We own your account and any related Virtual Items.  The amounts of any Virtual Items or any “virtual currency” balance shown in your account have no value outside of the game (e.g., in the real world), and instead only constitute a measurement of the extent of your limited license.  We may modify or eliminate Virtual Items (or the pricing of those Virtual Items) at any time and at our sole discretion, with or without notice.

**_Web Stores and Third-Party Payment Platforms_** — Virtual Items purchased in our games on other applications stores or platforms, including Meta, Apple, or Google, will be subject to those platforms’ payment terms and conditions.  We do not control how you pay on third-party platforms and are not responsible (or liable) for processing those payments.  Please review those platforms’ terms and conditions for additional information.  Your order for Virtual Items will represent your offer to obtain a limited license for the relevant Virtual Items, which will be accepted by us when we make the Virtual Items available in your account or process your payment, whichever comes first. Your limited license to Virtual Items begins when we accept your payment. When you get a limited license to use Virtual Items, they will be available in your account until used through the Services or otherwise surrendered as a result of termination of the Services in accordance with these Terms.

You are not allowed to transfer Virtual Items outside of the Services (e.g., in the “real world”), for example by selling, gifting, or trading them.  We will not recognize those transfers as legitimate.  In addition, you may not sublicense, trade, sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Items for “real” money, or exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of a game.  Any such prohibited transfer or attempted transfer will be void, and we may terminate your Account because of it, among exercising other remedies available to us under these Terms or applicable law.

**_Sales & Payment Terms_** — When purchasing Virtual Items or other content as may be made available, you agree to pay us (either directly or through a third-party platform) the applicable charges for your purchase, including applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an account registered to you, using a valid payment method we (or the applicable third-party platform) may accept in accordance with the billing terms and prices in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable.

**All sales of Virtual Items and/or other content are final**.  If you are charged for Virtual Items that you did not purchase, or you did not receive the items you purchased, or you were charged an incorrect amount, you may request a refund or correction pursuant to our or the relevant third-party payment provider’s practices, guidelines, or policies.  As explained above, if you purchased Virtual Items on other applications stores or third-party platforms, including Meta, Apple, or Google, those purchases and any requests for refunds will be subject to those platforms’ payment terms and conditions and will need to be sent directly to those providers.  You can request a refund for purchases made directly from us by contacting Customer Support or following other instructions available from within our Services.  Any refund request to us must be received within 96 hours after the purchase.  Any refund request to third-party payment providers must be received within the time period specified in the relevant third-party payment provider’s terms.

**ALL SALES ARE FINAL**.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, OR WHETHER YOU MADE A PAYMENT THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR ANOTHER PLATFORM SUCH AS APPLE, GOOGLE, META, OR ANY OTHER SITES OR PLATFORMS WHERE WE OFFER OUR SERVICES.  YOU WILL FORFEIT ALL VIRTUAL ITEMS IF WE TERMINATE OR SUSPEND YOUR ACCOUNT FOR ANY REASON, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION, OR IF THE SERVICES (OR ANY ASPECT OF THEM) BECOME NO LONGER AVAILABLE. IF YOUR ACCOUNT, OR A PARTICULAR SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT, IS TERMINATED, SUSPENDED, AND/OR IF WE HAVE TO REMOVE OR REVOKE ANY VIRTUAL ITEMS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT, NO REFUND WILL BE GRANTED, AND NO VIRTUAL ITEMS WILL BE CREDITED TO YOU OR CONVERTED TO CASH OR OTHER FORMS OF REIMBURSEMENT.  **PURCHASES TO ACQUIRE A LIMITED LICENSE AND RIGHT TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.**

You agree that all sales of Virtual Items to you are final, and we have no obligation to refund any transaction once it has been made.  You agree that when you purchase a Virtual Item, you request that the Virtual Item be delivered to you as soon as your order has been accepted.  If you live in the European Economic Area or in the United Kingdom, this means that you will lose your statutory right to withdraw from your purchase of a Virtual Item and the associated terms as soon as you access and use that Virtual Item.  

If, for any reason, you are refunded for a purchase of a Virtual Item, then we may also revoke your access to that Virtual Item.  We may (i) refuse a request for a refund, (ii) suspend or cancel payment of a refund we have agreed to make, and (iii) revoke your access to a Virtual Item to which that refund relates, if we find evidence of fraud, abuse, or other manipulative behavior by you.

**_Recurring Subscriptions_** — We may offer subscriptions to a recurring payment plan for the Services, including Virtual Items.  By purchasing a subscription (or activating a free trial subscription that automatically converts to a paid subscription if not canceled prior to the expiration of the free trial period), you request that we begin supplying the subscription Services immediately and you have entered into a periodic subscription contract with us.  Your subscription will automatically renew after the specified cycle (e.g., 30 days) without notice unless you cancel.  On your renewal date (or the date on which your free trial converts to a paid subscription, if not canceled by you), we will automatically charge the payment method associated with your account, plus applicable taxes, until you cancel.  Please note that prices and charges, including the fees associated with any subscriptions or the prices for any Virtual Items, may change at any time and in our sole discretion.  If we make a change to the periodic subscription rate, we will let you know in advance and give you the option to cancel.  **Subscriptions purchased through third-party platforms will be charged by the platform in accordance with its payment terms.  Please review the appropriate platform’s payment terms carefully for additional information.**

**_Subscriptions Auto-Renew Unless Canceled_** — Your subscription will automatically renew each subscription period unless and until you terminate your subscription, or we terminate it.  **You must cancel your subscription before it renews each billing period (or your trial subscription before expiration of the trial period), otherwise payment of the subscription fees for the next period will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method**.  You are solely responsible for the timely payment of all fees and charges and in ensuring the accuracy of the payment information associated with your account.  If your payment does not process for any reason, your subscription may be automatically canceled.

**_Cancellation of Subscriptions_** — For subscriptions purchased through us, you can cancel at any time by contacting Customer Support or navigating to the payment settings page (if applicable).  For subscriptions purchased through a platform such as Apple or Google, you may cancel at any time directly through the platform, as follows: you can manage and cancel your subscription at any time in the “Settings” of your device.  For iOS subscriptions, please see Apple’s support page available [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716210248489582&usg=AOvVaw1MQ4NQ22aTOYeFZGQaZIQ7).  For Google Play subscriptions, please see Google Play’s support page available [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl%3Den-GB%26co%3DGENIE.Platform%253DAndroid&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716210248489875&usg=AOvVaw0_a-2EOaqOExAos1TN5y6I).  

**EXCEPT WHERE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENTS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE AND THERE WILL BE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS.**  

If you live in the European Economic Area or in the United Kingdom, then you may withdraw from your initial purchase of a subscription within 14 days of that purchase.  To withdraw from a subscription, you must send us a clear written communication of your decision before the end of the 14-day withdrawal period.  If you purchased the subscription through a third-party retailer (like Apple or Google), then you should send this communication to them, and they will carry out this refund. You can request a refund from Apple ([here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/billing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716210248490315&usg=AOvVaw3ZNtC8hrxcGxkhRmPjOp6-)) and you can request a refund from Google ([here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl%3Den-GB%26ref_topic%3D3364671%26sjid%3D2645815341904122354-EU&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716210248490485&usg=AOvVaw1FpcWfDtq_qonAzvsOYSpH)).  If you purchased the subscription directly from us, you request a refund by contacting Customer Support or following other instructions available from within the Services.

1. **Disclaimers and Limitation of Our Liability**
    

Nothing in these Terms affects the statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of certain liabilities.  In those jurisdictions, the exclusions and limitations below shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of these jurisdictions.

**_Warranty Disclaimers_** — You access and use the Services at your own sole risk.  We provide the Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranty of any kind.  

* We make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the Services, or the information, content, materials, products (including software), or other services included on or otherwise made available through the Services.  As set forth above, the Services’ performance may be affected by your hardware, software, internet access, or other factors, each of which we do not control.  In addition, we may suspend, withdraw, or restrict the availability of all or any part of our Services at any time and for any reason.

To the full extent permissible by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, about the Services, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, non-infringement or availability, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.

* **YOU ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICES AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES.**
    

**_Limitation of Our Liability and Cap on Damages_** — To the full extent permissible by law, you acknowledge and agree that neither we nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Services (including our affiliates and corporate parents), will be liable:

* **For any personal injury or indirect, incidental, punitive, special, exemplary, consequential, liquidated, or punitive damages, including lost profits, loss of data or goodwill, service interruption, computer damage, system failure, or the cost of substitute services, in anyway whatsoever (and under any theory in any applicable jurisdiction, including warranty, contract, and tort or negligence) arising out of or in connection with these Terms or your use of or access to the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages; or**
    
* **For the conduct of third parties, including other users of the Services, User Content, and any operators of external platforms, apps, products or services, websites, or resources.  You acknowledge sole responsibility for, and assume all risk arising from, your use of any third-party platforms, products or services, websites, or resources. The risk of using any third-party app or third-party platform rests entirely with you.**
    

**THE RISK OF USING THE SERVICES RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU, AS DOES THE RISK OF ANY FORM OF INJURY FROM THE SERVICES OR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES.**

In addition, to the full extent permissible by law, the aggregate (or total) liability of us (and any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Services, including our affiliates and corporate parents) to you arising out of or relating to these Terms, your relationship with us, or your use of or access to the Services will not exceed the total amount paid by you in the six (6) months immediately before you first assert any claim.  These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.  Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, if no amount has been paid by you in the six (6) month period immediately before you first assert any claim, our aggregate (total) liability in any form of action whatsoever in connection with these Terms, your relationship with us, or your use of or access to the Services will be the total sum of twenty U.S. dollars (US$20).

1. **Time Limitation on Your Claims against Us**
    

You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or relating to these Terms or your relationship with us must be filed within one (1) year after the purported claim arose.  Otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that your claim will be permanently barred as untimely.  

1. **Governing Law and Venue for Legal Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration**
    

These Terms, and all claims or defenses based on, arising out of, or related to these Terms or our relationship under these Terms shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of California, without reference to its choice of law rules or any principle calling for application of the law of any other jurisdiction.

Except as provided below, any disputes not subject to the Agreement to Arbitration set forth in these Terms shall be heard only in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California, unless we mutually agree to some other location.  Each of us consents to venue and personal jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California, for purposes of any such action.

1. **Informal Dispute Resolution Process; Agreement to Arbitration; Consolidated, Class Action, Collective Action, and Representative Action Waiver**
    

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND INCLUDES A WAIVER OF A TRIAL BY JURY IN A COURT AND OF THE ABILITY TO BRING ANY CONSOLIDATED, CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.**

**Notice of Claim and Required Informal Dispute Resolution Process**

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, we shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing our mutual interests, attempt to reach a satisfactory solution, through first contacting Customer Support and then through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described below.  If these informal efforts do not resolve the concern or issue, as explained in more detail below, we each agree to resolve any dispute between us through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.

If you have any concerns about, or experience any issue with, the Services, most user concerns or issues can be resolved by contacting our Customer Support team at support@peoplefun.com.  **Before initiating the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as described below) or any arbitration or court proceeding pursuant to this Section, you must first contact us to address your concerns or issues.  Most disputes can be resolved that way**. 

If you have any concern or dispute that we cannot resolve, you agree to then try to resolve the dispute informally (the “Informal Dispute Resolution Process”) and in good faith by contacting us and providing a written notice of claim (the “Notice of Claim”) by sending an email to support@peoplefun.com  (Attention: Legal).  The Notice of Claim must provide us with an individualized and detailed description of the nature and factual basis of your individual, personal claim(s), the relief you seek (including a good-faith calculation of the specific amount in dispute), and information sufficient to identify your account(s) (such as a user ID or similar details).  Your Notice of Claim may only include your individual personal claim(s) and may not be combined with a Notice of Claim for other individuals.  After submitting your Notice of Claim, you then agree to meet and confer by email, telephonically, or by videoconference (such as Zoom), in good faith regarding your individual claim before taking any further action.  

If any dispute related to your Notice of Claim cannot be resolved through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process within sixty (60) days of our receipt of the Notice of Claim, this Section explains how you and we agree to resolve it.  **As explained in more detail below, except for certain exceptions described below, we each agree to resolve any dispute between us through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction**.  **You understand and agree that you and we are giving up the right to sue in court and the right to have a trial before a judge or jury**.

**Agreement to Arbitration; Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitration**

If we cannot resolve our dispute through customer support or through an Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as described above), **YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR, INCLUDING CLAIMS CONCERNING ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US, YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES**, **YOUR USE OF ANY GAME, ANY USER CONTENT, OR YOUR ACCOUNT**.  

This Agreement to Arbitration is intended to be interpreted broadly, and it applies to all disputes or claims of any kind under any theory (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory) that you may have or assert against us.  

You and we agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope, applicability, or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitration.  This includes questions about whether any dispute between us is subject to this Agreement to Arbitration (i.e., the arbitrator will decide the arbitrability of any dispute) and whether all or any part of these terms are void or voidable.

Please note that an arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court and provides more limited discovery.  It follows different rules than court proceedings and is subject to very limited review by courts.  The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  **YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND THE RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY**.

**Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitration**

This Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or we may bring in court in accordance with these Terms: 

(1) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; 

(2) claims for preliminary injunctive relief for violations of these Terms;

(3) claims to request enforcement or recognition of any award or order in any appropriate jurisdiction; and

(4) our ability to suspend or terminate access to the Services pursuant to these Terms.

_Small Claims Court_ — This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.  In addition, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in Santa Clara County, California, or the county or jurisdiction where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if such claims meet the requirements to be brought in that small claims court.  If either party files a claim in arbitration that could have been brought in small claims court, the other party may elect to resolve the claim through small claims court (rather than through arbitration) by providing notice to the other party before appointment of an arbitrator; upon receipt of such notice, the arbitration provider shall administratively close the case before assessing any fees, and the party bringing the claim must proceed in small claims court in lieu of arbitration.

_Our Right to Opt-Out of Mass Arbitrations_ — In addition, if ten or more demands for arbitration are filed that share common factual or legal issues, and if counsel for the parties submitting those demands are the same or coordinated, we have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Agreement to Arbitration and elect to resolve the claim through small claims court (if applicable) or courts of general jurisdiction (rather than through arbitration) by providing notice to the other parties (and the arbitration provider) of our opt out and election before appointment of an arbitrator.  Upon receipt of such notice, the arbitration provider shall administratively close the case before assessing any fees, and the parties bringing the claims must proceed in small claims court (if applicable) or courts of general jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.

**Procedure for Arbitration**

The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section.  The arbitration will be governed by the (i) Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures of JAMS and (ii) the Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines of JAMS if five or more demands for arbitration are filed that share common factual or legal issues and if counsel for the parties submitting those demands are the same or coordinated (collectively the “Rules”), as modified by these Terms.  The Rules are available at [https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716210248497160&usg=AOvVaw3EizTtNgGDnSHAWuNnXWPS) and [https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716210248497492&usg=AOvVaw3YYPsMHCrzfuD6FgNE4iwD).  We shall appoint one arbitrator (fluent in English), who will be bound by these Terms.  In the event of a conflict between the rules of the arbitration provider and the Terms, including with respect to the assessment of the fees and costs of arbitration, these Terms will govern.

To start an arbitration proceeding, use the form available on the JAMS website ([https://www.jamsadr.com/submit/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jamsadr.com/submit/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716210248497894&usg=AOvVaw2bUjYyTKYJZEeYv0T1auGm)).  Your arbitration demand must include an individualized and detailed description of the nature and factual basis of your individual, personal claim(s), the relief you seek (including a good-faith calculation of the specific amount in dispute), and information sufficient to identify your account(s) (such as a user ID or similar details).  In addition, your arbitration demand must demonstrate your compliance with the preconditions to arbitration outlined above (e.g., first contacting customer support and then following the Informal Dispute Resolution Process before proceeding to arbitration).  

Any arbitration under this Section that must take place in person (rather than through a more convenient virtual forum) will take place pursuant to the Rules and these Terms.  The parties agree that any live proceedings, including the arbitration hearing, will be conducted at a location reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.   

Payment of all filing, administrative, arbitrator fees, and costs of arbitration will be governed by the Rules, except as modified by these Terms.  If your claim is for US$25,000 or less, we agree to reimburse your share of the arbitration costs (but not your attorneys’ fees), including your share of arbitrator fees, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous, your claims were brought for an improper purpose, or your arbitration costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.  If you seek more than US$25,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and us according to the rules of the arbitration provider.  Notwithstanding the above, if you demonstrate that you are unable to afford the fees or costs of arbitration, qualify for a statutory exemption, or if the arbitrator determines that your payment of any portion of the costs or fees would be cost-prohibitive (as compared to litigation), we will pay them.  Irrespective of the amount you seek, neither party shall be entitled to have their attorneys’ fees or costs paid by the other party; provided, however, that either party may seek to recover their attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration if the arbitrator determines that the other party’s claims (or counterclaims) are frivolous or were brought for an improper purpose.

**For non-US Users**

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, termination, or breach thereof, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a satisfactory solution. If they do not reach a settlement within a period of sixty (60) days, then, upon notice by any party to the other(s), any unresolved controversy or claim shall be settled by arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“ICDR”) ([www.icdr.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.icdr.org&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716210248498579&usg=AOvVaw3oCZ2PClGCraPsj2fP7hHt)) in accordance with the provisions of its International Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration shall be in London, England, or another location that you and we mutually agree to, and the number of arbitrators shall be one. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English.

**Consolidated, Class Action, Collective Action, and Representative Action Waiver**

For disputes arising between us and you, or any other user, you and we agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. NEITHER YOU NOR WE CAN BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.  THE ARBITRATOR CANNOT COMBINE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIM INTO A SINGLE CASE, AND CANNOT PRESIDE OVER ANY CONSOLIDATED, CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING, UNLESS WE BOTH AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING.  NONETHELESS, IF ANY PORTION OF THIS CONSOLIDATED, CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER IS DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE OR INVALID, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE ANY AND ALL REMEDIES AUTHORIZED BY LAW. 

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CONSOLIDATED, CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.  HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION. 

### **30-Day Right to Opt Out**

You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Agreement to Arbitration within thirty (30) days after **first** becoming subject to this Agreement to Arbitration by sending us written notice of your decision to opt out to Support@peoplefun.com.  Your notice must include your name, account information, the email address associated with your account (if applicable), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitration.  If you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitration, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you, and we also will not be bound by this Agreement to Arbitration.

**Changes to this Section**

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future material change to this Section, you may reject any such material change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to legal@peoplefun.com.

**Severability**

This Section applies to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  If any competent authority deems any portion of this Section illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be severed, and the remainder of this Section will be given full force and effect.  

If any competent authority determines that applicable law precludes the arbitration of any claim, cause of action, or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action, or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action, or requested remedy, will be severed from this Agreement to Arbitration (as described below) and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.  If a claim, cause of action, or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action, or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action, and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.
