What data does the Work Smart app collect?
------------------------------------------

The Work Smart app collects and processes the following data across 2 categories.

1. User data
2. Functional data

**User data**  
This category includes data related to the individual user of the app. Such data is derived from the account used to log into Microsoft Teams and includes:

* Given name (The user's first name)
* Surname (The user's last name)
* Email (The user's email address)
* Tenant ID (The ID relating to the Office 365 tenant for the user's organisation)
* Object ID (The ID relating to the user within the specified organisation)

**Functional data**  
This category includes data related to the necessary proper functioning of the app itself.

* Messages sent to the app from the user via the chat feature

_Note: You may see references in Microsoft AppSource and the Microsoft Teams App Store about the collection of data other than the items listed under User and Functional data. This is because the Azure Bot Framework and Microsoft Teams Development Platform allows for the collection of data other than that specified in this Privacy Statement. Please rest assured that although the app could be capable of collecting more data, we only choose to actively collect, process, and sometimes store the data specified in this Privacy Statement._

Why does the Work Smart app collect data?
-----------------------------------------

The Work Smart app collects the specified User data for the following reasons:

* To provide a personalised user experience i.e. Greet the user by name within the app
* To understand usage analytics i.e. how many people have installed the app
* To allow ModernCollab. Ltd to contact users i.e. Important updates or issues

The app collects the specified Functional data for the following reasons:

* To fulfill the apps main purpose in providing the user with knowledge and answers relating to Microsoft Office 365

How does the Work Smart app this collected data?
------------------------------------------------

The Work Smart app collects User data upon the app being installed within Microsoft Teams, and only upon this one-time event. The app does not repeatedly collect User data again within the lifetime of the app. This User data is collected, processed, and stored for a finite period.

The app collects Functional data every time the user chooses to send the app a message. Messages are sent by the user to the app in 1 of 2 forms:

1. A message freely written in text format by the user using the chat feature
2. A button that is clicked by the user within the app navigation

This Functional data is collected, processed but not stored.

_Note: Although both User data and Functional data is collected, we do not correlate the 2 types of data together. We do not therefore know which user has submitted which message. Therefore, all user messages sent to the app is private and confidential and will not be stored, monitored, or analysed by ModernCollab. Ltd_

Where does the Work Smart app store data?
-----------------------------------------

The Work Smart app stores User data within the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. More specifically, User data is stored in a Cosmos DB service located in the Western Europe region. User data residing in this service is therefore compliant with all Microsoft privacy terms and security practices as stated in the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/trust-center)

User data stored in this context will reside in the Cosmos DB service for a maximum period 12 months to allow for relevant reporting and usage analysis.

The app does not store Functional data outside of the Microsoft Teams application. This Functional data stored within the Microsoft Teams application is bound by the data measures implemented by the user's organisation and therefore resides in the organisations Office 365 tenant.

Although Functional data is not stored, it is collected and processed. This enables the app to understand the intention of the user and respond with an appropriate reply. Functional data is processed within the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. More specifically Functional data is processed by the Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) service.
