Effective: May 7th, 2024

What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers how we treat Personal Data. “Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual and also includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules or regulations.

In this document "Personal Data" shall apply to Personal Data of individual Service users who are not child registrants. References to "Children's Personal Data" shall only apply to Personal Data of Child under the Age of Consent (defined below) users of the Services. General references to "data" or "information" shall apply to all users.

Company gathers Personal Data and Children’s Personal Data when you or your Child under the Age of Consent accesses or uses the Services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or how your Personal Data or Children's Personal Data is handled, please email us at [compliance@splashlearn.com](mailto:compliance@splashlearn.com)

How is children's Personal Data treated?

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. Moreover, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) requires that data controllers obtain consent from the holders of parental responsibility over children who are under 16 years of age before such controllers knowingly collect and process Personal Data from such children.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from a child under the age of 13 (if such child is located in the United States) or a child under the age of 16 (if such child is located in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom) (in each case, a “Child under the Age of Consent”) without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian (such consent, “Parental Consent” and such individual, “Parent ”), except for the limited amount of Personal Data we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (“Required Information”). Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent. Parental Consent is further described below in the “Data about Children” section.

If you are a Child under the Age of Consent, you may not register for the Services or otherwise disclose any Children's Personal Data to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except that you may share Required Information solely for the purpose of the Company obtaining Parental Consent. You may only interact with the Services under an account created by your Parent who has provided Parental Consent.

If you believe that a Child under the Age of Consent has provided us with Children’s Personal Data (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at [compliance@splashlearn.com](mailto:compliance@splashlearn.com). We do not condition participation in our Services on disclosure of more Children’s Personal Data from a Child under the Age of Consent than is reasonably necessary for that Child under the Age of Consent participation in the Services, and we do not retain Children’s Personal Data from Children under the Age of Consent any longer than is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was disclosed.

If you are a Parent of a user of our Services who is a Child under the Age of Consent , you may contact us at any time ([compliance@splashlearn.com](mailto:compliance@splashlearn.com)) to ask that (a) we stop collecting Children’s Personal Data from such user, (b) we delete any Children’s Personal Data already collected from such user (although note that we may further retain and use Anonymized Data as set forth the “Data that is Not Personal Data” section below), or (c) we stop disclosing Children’s Personal Data collected from such user to third parties, but continue to allow for collection and use of Children’s Personal Data collected from such user in connection with the Services.

If you are a child and your parent has signed up for the Service, you understand that your parent may be able to view all data within or associated with the account, including without limitation progress reports and usage data that tracks your performance on games, assessments and other tests available through the Services.

What Personal Data Does Company Collect?

The Personal Data you provide is used for such purposes as providing you the Services, answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Company's products and services, including specials and new features. The Children's Personal Data you provide shall only be used for creating individual account (which will allow you to receive progress reports that include tracking your child's performance and progress). You can choose not to provide us with certain data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

You may review, modify, stop collection of or remove your Personal Data or, if you are a Parent, your Child under the Age of Consent's Personal Data identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or account information.

If you are a teacher or a school, by sharing information about students (“Student Data”) or other data to SplashLearn, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to SplashLearn a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license during the term of the Agreement to use, transmit, distribute, modify, reproduce, display, and store the Student Data solely for the purposes of (i) providing the Services as contemplated by the Agreement, and as otherwise described herein, (ii) maintaining, supporting, evaluating, improving and developing our products, applications, and Service, and (iii) enforcing our rights under the Agreement.

We collect the following types of data from our customers:

Children’s Personal Data

**Profile Information:** We collect certain information about Child under the Age of Consent such as screen name, age and gender directly from Parents when such Parents set up an account. For additional information about the data that we collect from Child under the Age of Consent, please see the table further below.

If you are a teacher or a school administrator, you may also provide a full name for each applicable student to be able to track progress and distinguish students. Therefore, you may choose to provide a different identifier instead of a student’s name for this purpose. You may also provide us with a username and a password for each of the student accounts.

As a teacher you may also avail a QR code based login feature for their students. This method requires students to scan a QR code using their device's camera. The process of scanning the QR code does not capture any image, video, or other personal information. The process only reads the information contained in the QR code, which does not include any personal information.

**Activity Data:** We also record data around Child under the Age of Consent’s usage of the Services such as their activities, their performance on games and activities, in order to send you reports and recommend the most appropriate games and activities.

**Voice Recordings:** A Child under the Age of Consent (or Parent) can record their voice while reading a digital book and play it back to help them learn to read. This recording stays on your device and is not sent to our servers. The recording is automatically deleted as soon as you move to the next page of the book. The record voice feature is optional, and microphone access can be denied without affecting access to the books.

**Live Classes and Class Recordings:** SplashLearn’s live classes offering (“Live Classes”) have live tutoring sessions (“Class Sessions”) conducted over video conferencing by expert tutors. There may be more than one student participant in a Class Session. Student participants cannot turn on their video or audio and they cannot see or interact with other student participants during the Class Session. They may answer questions through a quizzing platform or using the chat feature available on the video conferencing platform. Their answers are only visible to the tutors and class coordinators and not to other student participants.

SplashLearn may make recordings of the class during a live class session (“Class Recordings”). As described above, since student participants cannot turn on their audio or video, Class Recordings only capture the audio and video of the tutor conducting the Class Session.

The Class Recordings may be used for improving the quality of instruction and to improve the class experience. To enable student participants to review a Class Session or in the case they were not able to attend it, Class Recording may also be shared with student participants and their Parents.

**Parental Consent:** SplashLearn obtains verifiable parental consent before collecting Personal Data from Children under the Age of Consent. If the Parent does not provide consent, we will not collect, use or disclose any Personal Data about the Child under the Age of Consent.

To prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or improper use of your information, and to maintain data accuracy, we've established physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the Personal Data and Children’s Personal Data we collect. In particular:

* We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
* We perform application security testing; penetration testing; conduct risk assessments; and monitor compliance with security policies.
* When you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) by default.
* SplashLearn's database where we store your Personal Data and Children’s Personal Data is encrypted at rest, which converts all Personal Data or Children’s Personal Data stored in the database to an unintelligible form.
* We ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption and salted hashing.
* SplashLearn's Website and the Service is hosted by [third-party service providers](https://aws.amazon.com/security/) at separate facilities, with whom we have a contract providing for enhanced security measures.
* We restrict access to Personal Data and Children’s Personal Data to authorized SplashLearn employees, agents or independent contractors who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

Company endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account information is kept private, however, Company cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Your Personal Data or Children's Personal Data is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your account and Personal Data or Children's Personal Data by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. The website contains links to other sites. Company is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services. Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post information to public areas on the Services or any other public forums, such information can be accessed by the public.

If SplashLearn becomes aware of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party or that any user data was used for an unauthorized purpose, we will comply with relevant state and other data breach laws. As and when required by the applicable laws, we will notify users of any breach resulting in unauthorized release of data electronically, at minimum, and without unreasonable delay so that you can take appropriate steps. The notification will include details as mandated by applicable laws, such as: date of the breach, the types of information that were subject to the breach, general description of what occurred and steps SplashLearn is taking to address the breach.

Data Deletion & Retention

We store your Personal Data or Children’s Personal Data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services, including those described above. Personal Data or Children’s Personal Data associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services.

Please note that we may have to retain some information after your account is deleted, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our community or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our Terms.

Deleting Your Account

You have the right to ask us to delete your account at any time. You can do so by contacting us at [help@splashlearn.com](mailto:help@splashlearn.com). In case a parent wants to get a student's classroom account deleted, please contact the student's school.

**Student Data Protection Policy:** We will not retain a student's Personal Data for any longer than is necessary for educational purposes, legal or contractual obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the child's Personal Data. Additionally, we only keep a student's Personal Data for as long as his or her student account is active, unless we are required by law or the child's school to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service or to enforce our Terms.

Please see the following section on information about data deletion due to account inactivity:

**Home Accounts:** For accounts created by parents, if neither the student, nor the student's parent(s) or any of the other student accounts associated with the parents' accounts have logged into their account in 2 years, SplashLearn will automatically delete or de-identify the Personal Data tied to the student account that is not necessary for educational purposes or legal obligations, including device tokens, device identifiers and IP addresses. In effect, the student account will be anonymized and de-linked from the parent account and the data will be non-recoverable. We will make reasonable attempts to inform parents about the account modification a few days in advance. We may retain some Personal Data about the parents for reasons outlined earlier, but these will not be tied to any Personal Data about the student. Parents can always request deletion of their accounts as outlined in the "Deleting your account" section.

**Classroom Account:** If neither the teacher, nor any of the students associated with the teacher account have logged into their account in 2 years or performed any activity, SplashLearn automatically deletes or de-identifies any Personal Data tied to the student accounts that is not necessary for educational purposes or legal obligations, including device tokens, device identifiers and IP addresses.

Please note that some content will not be deleted given various compliance and record-keeping obligations schools have. Please contact your (or the student's ) school if you would like this content deleted. If the school determines that the request should be implemented, they may submit a request to us.

**What happens when an account is deleted:** SplashLearn de-identifies or deletes any Personal Data tied to the accounts, including emails, usernames. device token, device identifiers, IP addresses. Some information may persist in backups that we maintain, for a reasonable amount of time. SplashLearn retains de-identified usage information about the accounts unless we contractually obligated to delete such information.

When a teacher or school administrator deletes an account from within their SplashLearn dashboard, the deleted accounts are kept in a recoverable state for 14 days before the deletion actually takes place. This is done so that any erroneous deletions on the user's part can be recovered and accounts may be restored.

Please note that after an account is deleted from our systems, it is not possible for us to restore the account or any Personal Data or Children’s Personal Data associated with it.

Communication Choices

During the time that you use the Services, you will receive emails from us, which includes emails around new features and updates, practice reports and reminders, promotional offers and account related emails.

You may opt-out from receiving emails from within your SplashLearn account, or by using unsubscribe links included in the emails themselves. Opting out from certain types of emails may prevent us from providing you key portions of the services, such as providing progress reports that explain your child’s performance and progress using the Services.
