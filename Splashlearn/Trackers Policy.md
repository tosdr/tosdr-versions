SplashLearn is on its way to becoming a learning experience like no other. We will surprise you soon with something super exciting and fun!

**In case you're wondering...**

* **Q1. I'm a parent/teacher with an existing account on Splash Math. Does it change anything for me?**
    
    No change. You can continue using your account just like you've always been. The progress of your children or students will remain intact.
    
* **Q2. I'm a teacher and am inviting parents to Splash Math. Do I have to do anything differently?**
    
    No, you can continue to invite parents the same way you've been doing all this while. The change in name will not affect the parent's experience or yours in any way.
    
* **Q3. I use the Splash Math app. Does this mean I need to download a new app or create a new account?**
    
    No need to download a new app, you can continue using the same app.
