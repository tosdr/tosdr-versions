E.             Choices You Have About How Allscripts Uses Your Information

1.         _Managing Your Account_.  You have the following choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to Allscripts for use:
    
    1. Generally, you may change how your information is used and disclosed through the account setting and account management features. As explained more fully in the [Terms of Use](https://www.followmyhealth.com/UseDocuments/TermsOfUse), modifications to your FollowMyHealth record are not automatically communicated to your Providers or any third-party sources. If you want your Provider or a third party to know of changes within your FollowMyHealth record, you must inform the Provider or third-party of such changes.
        
        You may access your FollowMyHealth account at any time to review your PHR Data. To request a change to any of your Personal Information, please contact your healthcare provider or the organization that provided the Personal Information for your FollowMyHealth account. For technical questions related to the FollowMyHealth product, please access the email support link on the FollowMyHealth Support page.
        
    2. You may opt out of receiving various communications with regard to the Service by changing your account settings or, if the account settings feature is unavailable, by notifying Allscripts at [support@followmyhealth.com](mailto:support@followmyhealth.com).
2.         _Authorized Individuals_.  You may grant access to your FollowMyHealth account to one or more Authorized Individuals or Authorized Individual-Representatives. You may grant an Authorized Individual access to your FollowMyHealth account by specifically authorizing FollowMyHealth to permit access by such Authorized Individual to your FollowMyHealth account. When you grant access to an Authorized Individual, you may permit the Authorized Individual to: (a) have the same level of access to your FollowMyHealth account as you have, i.e., the Authorized Individual will be authorized to access your FollowMyHealth health record and to communicate with your Providers and/or engage in other transactions with your Providers to the same extent that you are able using FollowMyHealth; or (b) have "read-only" access to your FollowMyHealth account, i.e., the Authorized Individual will be authorized to access and read your FollowMyHealth health record ONLY, and will NOT be able to communicate with or otherwise engage in transactions with your Providers. Whether or not to grant an Authorized Individual full-access or read-only access to your FollowMyHealth account is your decision. You acknowledge and agree that: (a) you are solely responsible for verifying the identity of, and monitoring the use by, any Authorized Individual you select; and (b) Allscripts has no responsibility or liability in connection with any access to, or use of, your account and information by any Authorized Individual or Authorized Individual-Representative.
3.         _Deactivating a Provider, Other Third-Party or Authorized Individual_.  You may revoke any Provider's, third-party's, or Authorized Individual's authorization to communicate with you, or request information from you or your FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record through the Service by utilizing the account management tool of the Service. Once revoked, the Provider, third-party, or Authorized Individual may no longer access and use the Service with respect to you and your Personal Information. Any disclosure of your PHR Data or Personal Information made prior to the authorization revocation cannot be recalled, removed, or retrieved by Allscripts. By using the Service, you agree that Allscripts cannot, and has no obligation to, remove Personal Information from your Provider's, other third-party's or Authorized Individual's records once properly disclosed.
4.         _Terminating Your Account_.  You may terminate your Allscripts account at any time by notifying us at [support@followmyhealth.com](mailto:support@followmyhealth.com). In addition, except with respect to an Authorized Individual-Representative who establishes an account on behalf of a Dependent, Allscripts will terminate your account within thirty (30) days of its receipt of a death certificate certifying your death. With respect to an Authorized Individual-Representative, Allscripts will terminate all accounts associated with such Authorized Individual-Representative within thirty (30) days of its receipt of a death certificate certifying the death of such Authorized Individual-Representative unless a Dependent also has a living Authorized Individual-Representative associated with the account. Otherwise, Allscripts will maintain and/or destroy all PHR Data and Personal Information associated with your account in accordance with its then current document retention and destruction policies. Please note that copies of your Personal Information may remain in your Providers', other third-parties' and Authorized Individual-Representative's and/or Authorized Individual's records, as described in Section F.3, above.

F.             Data from Children Under the Age of 18

The Service is not intended for use by children younger than 18 years old. Allscripts will not knowingly collect information from site visitors younger than 18 years. However, parents or guardians may elect to establish FollowMyHealth Universal Health Records for their children through the Service as Authorized Individuals-Representative and, in doing so, expressly consent to Allscripts utilizing such information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Use](https://www.followmyhealth.com/UseDocuments/TermsOfUse).

An Authorized Individual-Representative may authorize and/or have access to a FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record for a Dependent. Through the account, the Authorized Individual-Representative may:  (a) review and update the Dependent's personal health record as maintained on FollowMyHealth; and (b) engage in such communications and transactions as permitted between the Authorized Individual-Representative and the Dependent's Providers through the FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record. Accounts created for Dependents are specific to each healthcare Provider. Thus, an Authorized Individual-Representative will have to specifically authorize each Provider to establish a FollowMyHealth account in the name of the Dependent. A Dependent's FollowMyHealth account will be linked to an Authorized Individual-Representative's FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record account until the earlier of the date: (i) the Dependent reaches the age of 18; (ii) the Authorized Individual-Representative is no longer the legal representative of the Dependent; or, (iii) FollowMyHealth is notified by the Dependent's Provider or a court of law or agency with appropriate authority that the Dependent has been emancipated, attained legal custody of his or her own health information, or that a different Authorized Individual-Representative has been named. Each Authorized Individual-Representative agrees that a Dependent's FollowMyHealth account also may be linked to the FollowMyHealth account of another Authorized Individual-Representative, and each Authorized Individual-Representative will have the same rights to access and communicate through the Dependent's FollowMyHealth account.

G.             Security and Confidentiality

Allscripts uses both technical and procedural Security Measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and security of the FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record and other databases, including the use of firewalls, complex passwords, dual-factor authentication, various audit trails, data loss prevention, regular penetration testing, risk assessments, and anti-virus software. FollowMyHealth encrypts all PHR Data during transmission between your Provider and FollowMyHealth. Within FollowMyHealth, all PHR Data is encrypted at three levels: each individual has a unique encryption key; demographic information is encrypted; and clinical data is separately encrypted.

The safety and security of your Personal Information and PHR Data also depends on you. You are solely responsible for deciding to disclose or transmit PHR Data in your FMH account to any external third party and whether to do so via encrypted or unencrypted mechanisms. To further protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information and PHR Data, change your password on a regular basis and keep your password confidential. Notify Allscripts immediately if you believe your password has been breached. Also, remember to log off the FollowMyHealth site before you leave your computer.

H.             Security Breach Notification Requirements

Pursuant to applicable law, Allscripts may be required to send you notice of security breaches or suspected security breaches that impact your Personal Information and PHR Data.

I.             Changes to this Privacy Policy

Allscripts reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy in its sole discretion. In such case, Allscripts will post the new Privacy Policy on the web site and the effective date of the new Privacy Policy will be clearly marked. When Allscripts makes material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you within a reasonable period of time prior to the change.
