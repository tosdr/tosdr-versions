----------------------

You may grant access to your FollowMyHealth account to one or more Authorized Individuals or Authorized Individual-Representatives. You may grant an Authorized Individual access to your FollowMyHealth account by specifically authorizing FollowMyHealth to permit access by such Authorized Individual to your FollowMyHealth account. When you grant access to an Authorized Individual, you may permit the Authorized Individual to: (a) have the same level of access to your FollowMyHealth account as you have, i.e., the Authorized Individual will be authorized to access your FollowMyHealth health record and to communicate with your Providers and/or engage in other transactions with your Providers to the same extent that you are able using FollowMyHealth; or (b) have "read-only" access to your FollowMyHealth account, i.e., the Authorized Individual will be authorized to access your FollowMyHealth health record ONLY, and will NOT be able to communicate with or otherwise engage in transactions with your Providers. Whether or not you grant an Authorized Individual full-access or read-only access to your FollowMyHealth account is your decision. You acknowledge and agree that: (a) you are solely responsible for verifying the identity of, and monitoring the use by, any Authorized Individual you select; and (b) Allscripts has no responsibility or liability in connection with any access to, or use of, your account and information by any Authorized Individual.

Authorized Individual-Representative

An Authorized Individual-Representative may authorize and/or have access to a FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record for a Dependent. Through the account, the Authorized Individual-Representative may be able to: (a) review and update the Dependent's personal health record as maintained on FollowMyHealth; (b) communicate with the Dependent's Providers with regard to the Dependent's health status and otherwise; and (c) engage in such transactions as permitted between the Authorized Individual-Representative and the Dependent's Providers through the FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record. Accounts created for Dependents are specific to each health care Provider. Thus, an Authorized Individual-Representative will have to specifically authorize each Provider practice to establish a FollowMyHealth account in the name of the Dependent. A Dependent's FollowMyHealth account will be linked to an Authorized Individual-Representative's FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record account until the earlier of the date: (i) the minor Dependent reaches the age of 18, or (ii) FollowMyHealth is notified by the Dependent's Provider or a court of law or agency with appropriate authority that the Dependent has been emancipated, attained legal custody of his or her own health information, or that a different Authorized Individual-Representative has been named. Each Authorized Individual-Representative understands that a Dependent's FollowMyHealth account also may be linked to the FollowMyHealth account of another Authorized Individual-Representative, and each Authorized Individual-Representative will have the same rights to access and communicate through the Dependent's FollowMyHealth account. Each Authorized Individual-Representative agrees that if he or she becomes aware of any change in any Authorized Individual-Representative's relationship to the Dependent that may result in the Authorized Individual-Representative no longer qualifying as an Authorized Individual-Representative, the Authorized Individual-Representative will advise the Dependent's Providers of the same.
