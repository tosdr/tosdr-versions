**If you do not agree to the terms and conditions below, please do not** **proceed with your purchase.**

**Terms & Conditions**

At Hearth and Home, we are invested in each order 100%. During our conversation, we will help you measure, choose your padding thickness, and select your fabric and accents, taking into account the perfect feel for the room. Please understand that each cushion is handmade to fit your space,  so we rely on great communication from our clients so we can get a good understanding of your space. Reach out to our [Design Consultant](https://thehearthandhomestore.com/design-consultation/) to get personal assistance.

**Color/Fabric Selection**

We strongly recommend purchasing a swatch before placing your order if you are color matching as computer monitors can show a variation of color. We firmly DO NOT accept returns based solely on the expectation of color. Product images on our site are not the exact item your will be receiving so please understand the colors, textures, patterns may appear slightly different than the actual product material you will be receiving. Browse to the [Fabric Choices](https://thehearthandhomestore.com/fabric-choices/) page to our options. Fill in the form at the bottom of the page to request a swatch.

**Measurements**

Please be sure your dimensions are accurate.  It is our responsibility to create custom cushions and pillows in the fabric, trim, and fill selected by the customer in the dimensions provided by our customer with our allowable variance.

Allowable Variance for the following products:

Standard Box Cushion: +/- 1/2 inch width, depth and length of provided dimensions

Button Tufted Cushions: +/- 1/2 inch width, depth and length of provided dimensions

Hand Tufted Cushions : +/- 1 inch width, depth and length of provided dimensions

Your comfort is important to us, however we cannot guarantee or accept returns based on the firmness/softness or other factors regarding the comfort level of our products.  When we speak with you, we’ll find out what comfort level you are seeking and will advise accordingly.

**Care & Cleaning**

We recommend spot cleaning _all_ of your upholstery fabric for best results. Use cold water and mild detergent (such as Woolite). Drying is NOT recommended – Air Dry Only.

If you have chosen a [Premier Prints fabric](https://thehearthandhomestore.com/fabric-choices/), the manufacturer recommends not laundering as it may shrink.

If you do choose to wash your Hearth and Home custom upholstered fabric or item(s), we are not responsible for any damages that may occur during the process. Hand tufted and button tufted cushions cannot have their cover removed for washing.
