However, the PDPA expressly excludes the following categories of personal data from its application:
    
    a) 'business contact information,' which is defined as 'an individual's name, position name or title, business electronic mail address or business fax number and any other similar information about the individual, not provided by the individual solely for his personal purposes;'
