Information we collect and how its used
---------------------------------------

Usually, your username cannot be traced back to you except if it contains your name or if you also use it on other platforms. Because of that, we protect your username the same way we protect personal data.

Your password is already concealed on your computer (hash) and will then be stored with more security (hash + salt) on our servers. So your password will never reach our servers in plaintext and is extra secured.

We also save the point in time of your registration to create statistics. Besides that, we have to save that time to be able to prove that you have accepted this policy.

All settings of your Minecraft server and all files that are created by your Minecraft server are saved on our servers. Furthermore, we may send this data to remote backup servers

To be able to understand what happened when errors or problems occur we save miscellaneous activities on our website in a log file, e.g. when you start your server, who enters or leaves your server, when you up- or download a world or when you change your email address or password.

This information can and will be used to:

* Security purposes (guarantee it's you making the changes)
