### **DISCLAIMER AND PRIVACY STATEMENT**

**Exhibition** 

Before committing the work to a public show or any other display, the purchaser must give the artist notice of his/her intent to do so. All details of the show should be made known to the artist.

**Privacy** 

The purchaser gives the artist permission to use the purchaser's name (or company name), along with a reproduction of the item purchased from the artist (including but not limited to a portrait, writing, idea, or anything available on or listed on this web site) for (including but not limited to) exhibition, website display, advertising, and online resume and gallery, without violation of the purchaser's rights of privacy, or any other personal or proprietary rights the purchaser possess in connection with the reproduction and sale of the work, the preliminary design, or any incidental works made in the creation of the work.

**Destruction and restoration** 

The purchaser agrees that the purchaser will not intentionally destroy, damage, alter, modify or change the original work in any way. The purchaser agrees to see that the original work is properly maintained. If any alteration of any kind occurs after receipt by the purchaser, whether intentional or accidental and whether done by the purchaser or others, the work shall no longer be represented as the work of the artist without the artist's written consent. If the work is damaged, the purchaser will consult the artist before any restoration and must give the artist the first opportunity to restore it, if practicable. 

**Kill fee** 

In event of a cancellation of an agreed upon Work, the Artist will be paid 50% of the agreed upon final fee for time and effort invested in the Work ("kill fee"). The Artist will also retain the actual Work and all rights laid out in the contract as if the Work had been completed. If the Purchaser is still not satisfied with the final work, even after the Artist's best efforts to reach his/her satisfaction, the Artist will retain the aforementioned kill fee for time and effort invested in the work.

**Satisfaction** 

If the Purchaser is not satisfied, the Artist will work to change and complete the work -- within reason -- for the Purchaser or Client. The Artist will stay within the limits of his own style and manner of working, while understanding that the Purchaser is already aware of the qualities the Work will have upon completion. If no reasonable resolution can be reached with the Work, the Purchaser may cancel the project with the stated "kill fee" still applying.

**Permission** 

If you wish to have permission to use something from this site, or have any questions, please email your question to the artist. Lydia Roberts and/or Evan Schultz, or any known aspect of badinkstudios.com -- will not use any personal information provided by you in emails for any purpose other than to answer a question or coorespond personally with you as necessary. Your email or personal address will not be sold or given out to anyone else, unless specifically requested by you. If, however, someone sends me an email or message with something quotable or important to say, I do reserve the right to place it on this website -- unless preference against is specifically stated by the contributer. I will give credit -- where possible -- to the contributer for such a quote or shared information. Prices and policies are subject to change without notice. All legal and intellectual copyright terms listed here are effective for all contractual work agreed upon as of January 1, 2022. Wherever possible, these terms are also retroactive to all recent previous work, taking into consideration previous contract agreements up to this date.

**Any violation of these terms, both direct or implied as set out here, will result in legal and compensatory action.**
