### 6\. WHO HAS ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

**6.1. Employees and consultants.** Haldor’s employees and consultants are authorised to access your personal information only to the extent necessary to serve the applicable purpose(s) and to perform their job functions.

**6.2. Sharing your information.** In general, we do not sell, rent, share or otherwise disclose your personal information with other users or the public, unless you have consented and/or instructed us to share your information by choosing a privacy setting that allows for such disclosure, or otherwise agreed to share your information with third parties on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, you should always exercise caution or discretion when using the Service and/or websites, in particular when using social network applications that are integrated into our Service and/or websites.

Notwithstanding, in our endeavour to provide you with quality services, we may need to make certain exemptions to this general non-disclosure principle (for example, when information about you cannot be transferred in anonymous and/or in pseudonymised form). If so, we may:

**a)** use third-party service providers to process information on our behalf for the purposes outlined above, for example, to provide technical and support assistance, to providing IT and cyber security services, to providing fraud checking services and other user services etc.

**b)** to share personal data when required under applicable statutory laws, court proceedings or other legal proceedings or if we reasonably conclude that it is necessary to disclose the information in order to; (i) investigate, prevent or take measures upon suspicion or actual detection of illegal activities or in order to aid public authorities; (ii) fulfil our agreements with users; (iii) protect the security and/or the integrity of the Service and websites.

**6.3. Research and statics.** For research and statistical purposes, to the extent possible, we prepare anonymous, aggregate, or generic data (including “generic” statistics) for a number of purposes outlined above. As we consider that you cannot reasonably be identified from this information, we may share it with any third party (such as our partners). However, also in this we apply a restrictive approach in order to ensure a high level of security, safety and integrity.

**6.4. Third party service providers.** Our third-party service providers, acting on our behalf, always operate under contract and only in accordance with our and the customers instructions, in line with this policy, and are subject to appropriate confidentiality, privacy and security obligations. Please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://haldoredu.com/cookie-policy/) for further details and cookie settings related to third party service providers.

**6.5. Transfer of personal data outside the EU/EES.** Haldor may engage external partners and suppliers to perform services on behalf of Haldor and customers, such as to provide system services, hosting services, software or applications solutions or other services aimed to enhance the Service performance or user experience. The performance of these services may entail service providers’, both within and outside of the EU/EEA, obtaining access to customer contents and personal data. We use a variety of legal and technical mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data. Service providers processing personal data on behalf of Haldor and/or its customers (as sub-processors) are contractually obliged to enter into agreement with Haldor in order to ensure a high level of protection for your personal data.

For service providers located outside the EU/EEA, additional protective measures and legal mechanisms are undertaken, including entering into an agreement which includes the European Commission’s latest adopted model clauses for data transfers, which can be found on the European Commission’s website: [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en).

When you, as a user, choose a privacy setting that allows third parties to access your personal data, you consent explicitly that your information may be transferred to third parties outside of the EU/EES pursuant to Article 49(1)(a) of the GDPR. For further information about the possible risks of data transfer for data subjects and appropriate safeguards adopted by our service providers, please refer for example to section 6.6.

YOU SHOULD ALWAYS EXERCISE CAUTION OR DISCRETION WHEN CHOOSING A PRIVACY LEVEL THAT ALLOWS FOR THIRD PARTY DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION DUE TO THE POSSIBLE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAFEGUARDING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA THAT IS TRANSFERRED TO COUNTRIES WITHOUT ADEQUATE LEVEL OF PROTECTION AFFORDED TO THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA.

### 7\. FOR HOW LONG AND WHERE DO WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

**7.1.** We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you the Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services or visiting our website. However, we will not retain your personal data for a longer period than is necessary, taken into account the purpose for which they were initially retained and our legal obligations. In some cases, we choose to retain certain information (for example, visits to our website or other automated logs) in a depersonalised or aggregated form.

**7.2.** If you choose to close your account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 48 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.

We may retain certain personal data about you for an extended time after you have chosen to close your user account, if it is necessary for us to fulfil our legal obligations (including requests from authorities), comply with laws and regulations, establish, invoke, or defend legal claims, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, fulfil our legal, regulatory or social responsibilities.

For more specific information on Haldor’s specific retention policies and principles of your personal data, please contact us at the address indicated in section “_Contact Information_” below.

**7.3.** We take reasonable steps to ensure that the data we collect or retain under this Policy is processed according to the provisions of this Policy and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.

**7.4.** Information you have shared with others (for example, through the Service) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own account, and we do not control data that other users have copied out of our Services.

**7.5.** The information processed by Haldor, including the Service or websites, is stored on servers as listed in section 6.6. Please see our server host(s)’ privacy policy and/or statement for further details.

### 8\. YOUR RIGHTS

**8.1.** With respect to personal data for which we, Haldor, is Data Controller, the users are hereby advised of the following rights:

**a) Right of Access.** If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your personal data and, if so, provide you with a copy of that personal data (along with certain other details such as purpose of the processing etc.).

**b) Right of Data Portability.** In certain cases, you have the right to obtain your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. You may reuse it elsewhere.

**c) Right to Rectification.** If your personal data is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to have it rectified or completed. If we have shared your personal data with others, we will tell them about the rectification where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your personal data so that you can contact them directly.

**d) Right to Erasure.** You may ask us to delete or remove your personal data and we will do so in some circumstances, such as where we no longer need it. Notwithstanding, we retain the right not to delete personal data pursuant to this Policy. If we have shared your data with others, we will tell them about the erasure where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so that you can contact them directly.

**e) Right to Restrict Processing.** We provide your choices about the collection, use and sharing of your personal data and updated digital contents, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your account information. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. Notwithstanding, you may ask us to restrict or ‘block’ the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of that personal data or object to us processing it. If we have shared your personal data with others, we will tell them about the restriction where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so that you can contact them directly.

**f) Right to object.** You may ask us at any time to stop processing your personal data, and we will do so: (i) if we are relying on a legitimate interest to process your personal data — unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing; or (ii) if we are processing your personal data for direct marketing.

**g) Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling.** You have the right to be free from decisions based solely on automated processing of your Personal Data, including profiling, unless such profiling is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, an agreement between you.

**h) Right to Withdraw Consent.** We provide your choices about the collection, use and sharing of your personal data and updated digital contents, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your account information. We offer you settings to control and manage the personal data we have about you. Notwithstanding, you have always the right to inform us that you wish to withdraw that consent. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your prior consent.

**i) Right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority.** If you have a concern about this Policy, including the way we have handled your personal data, you may report it to the competent data protection authority that is authorised to address those concerns. The Swedish Data Protection Authority (_Sw.: Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten, IMY_) is the competent data protection authority in Sweden charged to protect the individuals’ privacy in the information society.

**8.2.** You may exercise your rights by contacting us as indicated under the section “_Contact Information_” below.

### 9\. SECURITY INFORMATION

**9.1.** We maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and administrative security measures to protect personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction in light of the risks inherent in processing this information, including where appropriate the following:

**a)** Using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption in transit (transferring data) and state-of-the-art encryption when data is at-rest;

**b)** Limiting access rights to the information we collect about you according to your chosen privacy setting (for example, only those of our personnel who need your information to carry out our business activities are allowed access to process your information);

**c)** Implementing physical, digital, and procedural safeguards in line with relevant business standards and guidelines.

For more information regarding our security, please contact us at the address indicated under section “_Contact Information_” below.

**9.2.** We regularly monitor our systems to identify possible vulnerability and potential attacks. However, we cannot guarantee the security for information which users make available to other users within the Service. Please consider that there is no guarantee for the protection from unauthorised access or disclosure, change or destruction of personal data despite our physical, technical and administrative security measures. The same applies to all information that has been made publicly available on the internet.

### 10\. MARKETING AND ADVERTISEMENT

**10.1.** Advertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products and services. Haldor does not use customer contents in the Service to target ads to you. We use other data and sources for marketing and advertising our products and services. For example;

**a)** Each time you create or reply to a survey, post, or thread on a Haldor blog or website forum, blog, RSS, or other information sharing sources (including specific forms on our websites for signing up for marketing materials, advertisements, event invitations or any other information about our services and products etc.), we may record the forum, blog, RSS or information sharing source name and the time and date of your post or thread with your (account) details. We do this to better understand our users, to provide user tools and guidance and to select or tailor our products, services, marketing communications to reflect your use activity. We do not use the content of such posts or threads for any other additional purposes.

**b)** We may link or combine the information that we collect from the different sources outlined above (including information received from our business partners and third-party developers). Information may be linked via a unique identifier, such as a cookie, plugin, or other account identifiers. Alternatively, we may decide to combine two or more databases into a single database of user information. We may do this for your and/or our convenience (for example, to allow you to register for a new product or service more easily), to allow us to provide a more seamless user support whenever you contact us and to provide you with qualitative, personalised services, content, marketing, and adverts.

**10.2.** Haldor also adheres to the self-regulatory advertising/marketing program [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

### 11\. DISPUTES AND COMPLAINTS

If you have any complaints concerning Haldor’s compliance with this Policy or related policies and statements, please contact us first.
