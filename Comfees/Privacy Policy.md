======================

**Attindas Hygiene Partners** 

**Attends Healthcare Products Inc. Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date**: June 2018

**Last Updated:** March 1, 2021

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to the websites, applications, and electronic communications on which it appears (the “Platform”).  This Policy describes how Attends Healthcare Products Inc. (a part of Attindas Hygiene Partners) as well as our affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively "Attindas" or "we" or "us" or "our") you in the United States uses the Personal Information that we collect, receive, maintain, and store about.  Please read this Policy carefully, by interacting with us through the Platform you consent to this Policy.

**Types of Personal Information Collected**

We may collect a range of Personal Information.  “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual.  When we combine Personal Information with other information (i.e. information that does not, on its own, identify you), we treat the combined information as Personal Information.  

**Contact Information –** If you sign up for our newsletter, submit an inquiry, request a sample, or make a purchase we may collect your contact and mailing information.  This may include your email name, address, and phone number.  

**Employment Information** – If you apply for employment with Attindas, we will collect your employment and work history, as well as other Personal Information related to your potential employment.  This may include your education and employment history, address and contact information, demographic information, and any other information included in your resume or application.  

**Location Data** – While navigating our Platform your mobile device or browser may share your location data, both through WiFi and GPS.  Attindas will collect this information based on the settings of your phone and browser. 

**Usage Information** – We may also collect usage and device information when you visit our Platform.  This may include information about the browser, operating system, and/or device identifier for the device you are using, your ISP and IP information, your navigation activity on the Platform, as well as the websites that you came from and the site you visit when you leave.

**Method of Information Collection**

We may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways.  We may collect Personal Information directly from you; for example, when you register an account on the Platform, make a purchase, submit a job application, or correspond with us through the Platform.  

We may also collect Personal Information from third parties.  For example, we work with business partners, subcontractors in technical and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information providers.  

We may also collect Personal Information from you passively.  Our Platform uses tracking tools like cookies, pixels, and web beacons.  We do this both on our Platform and in emails that we send to you.  Through these tools, we collect Personal Information about users over time when you use our Platform.  This collection includes usage and browser information.  We may also have third parties collect Personal Information in this way.  For more information about the trackers that we use, please see Section 6 of this Policy.  Additionally, if you enable location data on your device, this data will be collected passively based on the location settings on your device. 

**Combining Information**

We may combine Personal Information we obtain.  For example, we may combine Personal Information that we have collected online with Personal Information that we have collected offline, for instance during calls between you and our support team.  We may also combine Personal Information that we have collected across other third party sites or from other third parties with Personal Information we already have.  Finally, we combine Personal Information across devices.

**How We Use Personal Information**

We will use your Personal Information to fulfill your purchases and offer our services, respond to your requests and inquiries, as well as to send you communications.  We may also use your Personal Information to communicate with you for transactional purposes.  For example, we might contact you about this Policy or our Terms of Use.  We may also use your information to process your employment application and assess your employment candidacy, as well as communicate with you for hiring purposes. 

We may also use your Personal Information to improve our Platform, products, and services.  This may include using your Personal Information to customize your experience with us.   We may also use your Personal Information for the security of the Platform and our company, our customers, and other third parties. We may also use your Personal Information to protect against fraud and other malicious activity.

We may also use your Personal Information for marketing purposes.  For example, we may send you information about new features on the Platform, new services we offer, and special offers.  When legally permitted, this may also include using your Personal Information to serve you ads and to tell you about products or offers available through us, or third parties, that we think you might find interesting.   

Finally, we may use your Personal Information for other purposes, as permitted by law.  

**Sharing Personal Information**

We may share your Personal Information in the following circumstances:

* **Within Attindas** – We may share your Personal Information within our family of companies. 
* **Service providers –** When we hire a service provider to help operate the Platform or our business, we may give access to Personal Information as necessary to perform the service for Attindas.  This may include service providers that operate our Platform, send our communications, or run our promotions.

* **Third Parties for Marketing Purposes** – We may share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes.  This may include third parties whose services we believe you may be interested, or who are interested in providing you with services.  These third parties may share your Personal Information with others and may use it for their own interest based advertising.
* **Legal obligation or protection from harm -** When we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of Personal Information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy or comply with any requirement of law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce or investigate a potential violation of the Terms of Use, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise respond to fraud, security or technical concerns, (d) support auditing and compliance functions, or (e) protect the rights, property, or safety of Attindas, its users, or the public against harm.
* **Merger or sale -** If and when Attindas is involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of transfer or sale of some or all of its business, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding. Personal Information may be transferred along with the business.  Where legally required we will give you prior notice and if you have a legal right to do so, an opportunity to object to this transfer. 
* **Purposes described to you –** We may share your Personal Information for other purposes, as we describe to you. 

**Cookies and Other Technologies**

We collect Personal Information about users over time on the Platform by using several common types of cookies and other tracking technologies including web beacons, pixels, and flash cookies.  We also have third parties that collect Personal Information in this way on our behalf and for their own purposes.  Cookies are small files that download when you access certain websites.  For more information about cookies visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).  Web beacons, pixels, and other tracking technologies operate independent of cookies.

We may use a variety of cookies:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Type of Cookies | Description |
| Required | Required cookies are essential for the Platform to function properly and for you to navigate our Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Platform and using our services. |
| Performance | These cookies collect information about how you use the Platform, including which pages you go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages. These cookies do not collect information that individually identifies you. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Platform functions and performs. |
| Functionality | Functionality cookies allow the Platform to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of the Platform after logging-in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. |
| Targeting or Advertising | From time-to-time, we may engage third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Platform. We sometimes use cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Platform. The information provided to third parties does not include Personal Information, but this information may be re-associated with Personal Information after we receive it.<br><br>By way of example, as you visit the Platform, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our advertising partners then enable us to present you with retargeted advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with the Platform.<br><br>We also contract with third-party advertising networks and similar partners that collect IP addresses and other information on our Platform, from emails, and on third-party sites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting Site Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other websites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.<br><br>Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Platform or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. |

You can control cookies and tracking tools.  Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that prevents a website from tracking you, as well as additional cookie settings.  Our Platform does not currently respond to these signals.  If you choose to block cookies and other trackers, certain features of the Platform may not work.  Blocking or rejecting cookies will not stop all of the tracking described in this Policy.  These features and options are browser and device specific and are not uniform. You can usually find these settings in the options or preferences menu of your browser. To understand these settings, the following links for commonly used browsers may be helpful, or you can use the help option in your browser for more details:
