This policy is an integral part of the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy of this Website.

We inform you that the Website uses cookies or other data storage and retrieval devices with similar functionality (hereinafter "Cookies").

You will find below information about what cookies are, what type of cookies are used on the Website and how they can be configured or disabled.

1\. WHAT IS A COOKIE?
---------------------

Cookies are files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to the user's device when visiting a website.

Cookies are essential for the functioning of the Internet, as they offer technical solutions that allow the user to browse the different websites; they cannot damage the user's equipment/device and can be used to identify and resolve possible errors in the functioning of websites. They may also be used for advertising or analytical purposes.

2\. OUR USE OF COOKIES 
-----------------------

The Website uses Attindas own Cookies generated directly by this domain and third-party Cookies generated from other websites and belonging to third party companies, for the specific purposes described below. We may eventually use new Cookies on the Website to provide you with more and better services. In such case we will update this policy.

### (i) Technical Cookies.

Technical Cookies allow the user to browse the Website and use the different options or services that exist on it, such as, for example, controlling traffic and data communication, identifying the session, accessing restricted access areas, controlling fraud linked to the security of the service, counting visits for the purposes of billing licenses for the software with which the service works (website, platform or application), using security elements during browsing, storing content for the broadcasting of videos or sound or enabling dynamic content (for example, text or image loading animation).

We do not need your consent to install on your device Cookies that are necessary to activate the functionalities of the Website, and their use is based on the need to provide the services requested. Therefore, as they are necessary for the operation of the site, these Cookies will be activated by default and cannot be denied or deactivated.

In particular, we install technical cookies in order to:

* provide you with an ID to save your session preferences
* save your cookies preferences
* facilitate content caching on the browser to make pages load faster
* physical address validation

### (ii) Analytical Cookies. 

Analytical Cookies help website owners understand how visitors interact with the website by gathering and providing information in aggregate form.

The information obtained by these cookies is unlikely to represent a risk to the privacy of users, as they are analysed in aggregate form, for the purposes of obtaining statistics and reports that enable the Website to function better.

These are the analytics Cookies used on the Website:

| Cookies | Analytical Cookies Providers and Information | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * \_ga<br>* \_gat<br>* \_gat\_UA-107768699-1<br>* \_gid | [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB) | Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that uses the information from Cookies to analyse the number of visitors and visits to the Platform, the average duration of the visit, the average number of pages viewed by each user, geographical and socio-demographic reports (based on language, location, Internet provider, mobile device, etc.). |

You can accept or reject the installation of these Cookies.

### (iii) Advertising cookies. 

Advertising Cookies are used to show adverts that are relevant to the user. They are also used to limit the number of times a user sees an advert, as well as to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers.

You can accept or reject the installation of these Cookies. These Cookies are only installed on the user's device when the user accepts them.

### (iv) Connection with Google Products

This Website uses technologies that enable us to cross information from other platforms like your Google account. In this sense, the information visualised by these means is aggregated and it is not possible to identify a single individual.

For example, we could know the kinds of devices that have browsed the website, but we cannot identify a single device.

In the case of Google, the information from your account is only shared if you have activated [ads personalisation](https://support.google.com/My-Ad-Center-Help/answer/12155451?visit_id=638094517335233077-3261952638&rd=1).

You will find more information about this technology in the following [link](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7532985?hl=en&ref_topic=7668613#signedin&zippy=%2Cin-this-article).

3\. CONSERVATION PERIODS
------------------------

The Cookies used by us will be kept on your device for the time necessary for the purpose for which they were installed, and for a maximum of 2 years, unless you decide to delete them through the configuration options of your browser (see section 5 of this policy).

4\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
---------------------------

Some of the personal data obtained through third-party Cookies will be subject to international transfers, in which case we guarantee that the necessary guarantees will be adopted to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the same.
