Privacy Policy
==============

Complete Licensing Limited needs to collect your data that you share with us, in order to conduct our normal business activities, including providing services to you. We take data security very seriously and this policy sets out how and why we use your data, when and to who we disclose it and how we protect it.

We may amend this policy from time to time.  An up to date version of the policy will at all times be maintained and available on our website at www.completelicensing.uk.

Complete Licensing Limited is registered with the Information Commissioner, Registration Number: [**ZA764285**](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/ZA764285)

**Complete Licensing Limited as Data Controller**

We control the ways your personal data is collected and the purposes for which your personal data is used by Complete Licensing Limited. Complete Licensing Limited is the “controller” for the purposes of (i) the [**General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)**](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/contents)  (ii) [**the Data Protection Act 2018**](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted); and (iii) any other applicable laws and regulations relating to the processing of your personal data and privacy.

To learn more about GDPR visit [**gdpr.eu**](https://gdpr.eu/) by clicking [**here**](https://gdpr.eu/). 

**Legal basis for processing your personal information**

How we use your personal data will depend on whether you are a client, a representative of a client, a business contact, someone whose personal data we necessarily process as part of our provision of professional services, or otherwise. We may process your personal data for the following purposes:

(a)       providing a proposal to you or your organisation in relation to the professional services we offer and for client engagement purposes (including the carrying out of background checks);

(b)       providing professional services to you and / or our clients;

(c)       managing our relationship with you and / or our clients (including billing and financial management), for record-keeping purposes and more generally for the proper operation of Complete Licensing;

(d)       dealing with any complaints or feedback you may have;

(e)       monitoring and improving the performance and effectiveness of our services, including by training our staff;

(f)       seeking advice on our rights and obligations, such as where we require our own legal advice, and to exercise and defend our legal rights;

(g)         compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations, such as anti-money laundering laws (which may include the carrying out of background checks and retention of a record of such checks), data protection laws and tax reporting requirements, and / or to assist with investigations by police and / or other competent authorities (where such investigation complies with relevant law) and to comply with Court orders;

(h)         safeguarding the security of our systems and communications; and / or

(i)       for security purposes generally and to ensure the safety of our employees and visitors; and / or

(j)        any other purpose for which you provide us with your personal data;

We may process your personal data for any of the purposes set out above where one (or more) of the following lawful processing grounds applies:

(a)       the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, or to take steps at your request before entering into a contract with you;

(b)       the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations;

(c)     the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (including the operation of Complete Licensing Limited and the provisions of professional services) or those of any client or relevant third party, unless those legitimate interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights or freedoms; and / or

(d)     you have consented to the processing in question.

Where we process sensitive personal data, other lawful processing grounds may apply, such as that the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (for example to protect and / or defend our property or rights, or those of our clients) or for reasons of substantial public interest; or where you have given us your explicit consent.

**Who we share your information with.**

We shall not disclose any confidential information which we obtain to any other person or party except as is reasonable and necessary for the purpose of carrying out your instructions. We may also, from time to time, store data, including confidential information, on servers controlled by third party providers whose software or systems we use to provide, or decide to evaluate for the purposes of providing, our services (including e-disclosure, data retrieval and forensic investigations). In each such case we will ensure an appropriate confidentiality agreement is in place and/or where reasonably practicable any such data will be anonymised:

(a)        as required by law including, without limitation, in response to any requests for information under freedom of information or environmental legislation; and /or

(b)        as required by any regulatory, governmental or other authority to which we are subject or submit. In this regard we, and randomly selected client matters, are annually inspected for compliance purposes by regulated third parties and by our auditors.

**Marketing Emails.**

Our newsletter service provider is **[Mail Chimp](https://mailchimp.com/)** which is hosted on servers in the USA and has self-certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield framework and our agreements with them include a set of clauses approved by the European Commission to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data. We only share your email address with them for the specific purpose of sending you our email newsletter. You can view their privacy policy [**here**](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/#3._Privacy_for_Contacts).

You may opt-out of receiving our newsletter at any time, by clicking the unsubscribe link, in which case your details will then be permanently removed. If you have any problems with this process please email us at **[\[email protected\]](https://completelicensing.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**.

We use Mailchimp to manage our email marketing campaigns. Mailchimp uses tiny invisible images called ‘pixels’ that are contained within emails to enable us to see:

* whether you opened an email
* where in the world the device used to open the email was located (based on your device’s IP address)
* whether you shared the email on any social media platforms
* whether you marked the email as spam
* your overall level of engagement with our email marketing campaigns

We don’t use this information any purposes except if it appears that you’re not opening our emails

**Website Analytics.**

We collect some information when you visit the Website but this does not allow us to identify you personally. The information we collect includes the type of browser visitors use, time and date of visits, which pages are most viewed, and which other websites and search engines direct visitors to the Complete Licensing website. This enables us to evaluate the Website and work to improve it.

The software that we use to analyse our website is [**Matomo**](https://matomo.org/). We use Matomo Cloud-hosted service, details of their privacy policy can be viewed here. Unlike Google Analytics, Matomo does not share a visitor’s behavior with advertising companies.

Complete Licensing has specifically configured Matomo to respect your privacy by anonymising the IP addresses of visitors to our site and by respecting any ‘Do Not Track’ settings that you may have selected within your web browsers.

**How we protect your information**

We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your information secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of the data we collect about you.

We take information security very seriously and have implemented several technical and organisational measures to protect the information and personal data we hold. These include:

However, we tend to use whatever communications tools are preferred by our clients. Phone calls made to or from our mobiles are not encrypted (and if you dial into any conference call which uses encryption, your connection won’t be encrypted).
