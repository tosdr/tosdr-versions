Termination  
Sesame Workshop may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Sites at any time. Sesame Workshop may restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Sites and/or this Agreement if we reasonably believe or suspect you have acted inappropriately on the Sites or you are in breach of these Terms of Use or applicable law, or for any other reason without notice or liability. Additionally, Sesame Workshop may terminate use or access privileges to the Sites of users who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights. You may terminate this Agreement by discontinuing your use of and access to the Sites.

Miscellaneous  
This Agreement shall be deemed to include all other notices, policies, disclaimers, and other terms contained in the Sites, including our Privacy Policy; provided, however, that in the event of a conflict between such other terms and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

You agree that Sesame Workshop may assign any of its rights and/or transfer, sub-contract or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement is personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to a third party.

This Agreement is governed by and is construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in New York County, New York, U.S.A. in all disputes arising out of or relating to your use of the Sites.

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law including but not limited to the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations stated above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Sesame Workshop with respect to the Sites and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Sesame Workshop with respect to the Sites. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
