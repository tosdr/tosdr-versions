We do not have access to your credit or debit card details;
* Information regarding your donation history, donation amount, and your charitable interests; or

Depending upon the activity, some Personal Information will be mandatory for participation, and we will indicate it as such. If you do not provide the mandatory Personal Information with respect to an activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

Some of our Platforms are intended for children under the age of 13 (we refer to these individuals as a “Child” or “Children”). If we learn that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a Child on any of our Platforms that are not intended for Children, we will take steps to promptly delete that information.

We refer to this type of information as “**Usage Information**”. We collect Usage Information directly from your device through the use of cookies, web beacons, third party analytics providers, or other similar technologies.

We use cookies, web beacons (e.g., pixel tags), and local and session storage technologies to collect some of this information.

When we engage in cross-border data transfers, we will ensure that your legal rights and protections travel with any transfer of personal information, as required by applicable data protection laws.

**Security of Your Personal Information**

We implement and maintain technical and organizational measures to help secure your Personal Information. We host Personal Information in secure, cloud-based environments that use firewalls, encryption and other industry-standard technologies in an effort to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.  

While we strive to maintain the security of your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that information security measures are fail-safe or guarantee that Personal Information on a Platform may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.

**Retention of Your Personal Information**

We will retain your Personal Information in accordance with the time period allowed under applicable law, and with consideration for the sensitivity, volume, and type of Personal Information, as well as the purpose for which we have collected it, after which time we will take steps to delete it.

**SESAME WORKSHOP CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

We operate certain Platforms that are focused on children’s education and entertainment (“Children’s Platforms”) and we strive to operate the Children’s Platforms in alignment with the principles of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

_Information We Request on Our Children’s Platforms_

We will not ask a child to provide us with more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in any Platform activity or service.  For certain activities, there may be a “Share with a Friend” option where children can provide their first name, a friend’s first name, and friend’s email address to send a feature from a Children’s Platform to the friend via email. We use such Personal Information only to fulfill the child’s request and do not store that Personal Information for any longer than reasonably necessary to send the relevant email.

In the future, should we request Personal Information from a child in a manner that requires prior, verifiable consent from a parent, we will notify you of that change by updating this privacy policy and will implement practices that align with the requirements of COPPA.

If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a Child without the legally required prior, verifiable parental consent, regardless of where in the world they are located, we will delete that information promptly.

_Information We Collect Automatically on Our Children’s Platforms_

We automatically collect certain information from visitors to our Children’s Platforms to help us understand trends about our Children’s Platforms are used. This helps us to maintain and administer the Children’s Platforms, including to support our security efforts, to make improvements, and to understand aggregated information about the makeup of our visitors.

We use certain Service Providers to help us collect and understand this information. The information might include, for example, the Uniform Resource Locator (“**URL**”) from which the visitor arrived, the URL to which you next go, browser information, Internet Protocol addresses, a mobile device identifier, operating system, or general location data such as a city or zip code, as well as information about use of the Children’s Platforms, such as the pages or sections visited most often, the time spent there, and how a visitor moves through the Children’s Platform.  When this information is considered to be Personal Information, we treat it in accordance with this section of the privacy policy.

We and our service providers collect this information directly from the device through the use of cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies. A “cookie” is a small data file that a web site transfers to a user’s device and is stored on the user’s browser. As a user moves from one page or one screen to another, a cookie is used to tell us that it is the same device and to remember your preferences. A “web beacon” (also referred to as a “clear gif” or “pixel tag”) is a one-pixel image (which may be visible or transparent), which may be embedded on a web page or in an e-mail message, and which may also provide us with information about usage of that page or e-mail message, including if and when you have opened it. More information about the cookies used in our Children’s Platform is available in our [Cookie Notice](#CookieNotice). Most browsers allow you to control placement of cookies by third parties on your browser. To learn more about cookies and how to manage or delete them, refer to the “Tools,” “Help,” or similar section of your web browser.

_How We Use and Share Personal Information Collected on Our Children’s Platforms_

We use Personal Information collected from or about children to operate our business, such as to administer and maintain our Children’s Platforms and in support of our Children’s Platform internal operations, in accordance with consent provide by a parent, to comply with our legal obligations, and otherwise as described above.

We contract with third parties to provide certain services and to facilitate the internal operations of our Children’s Platforms, such as data hosting, analytics, and content delivery. These third parties may require access to certain Personal Information, only in order to provide their services.

_Managing Personal Information Collected on Our Children’s Platforms_

Parents may contact us at [dotorgmail@sesame.org](mailto:dotorgmail@sesame.org) with requests to review, update or delete any of their Children’s Personal Information that we may have collected, to revoke any consent that had been previously provided, and to elect for us not to collect any additional Personal Information from their children.  Please be aware that we may request additional Personal Information in order to verify your identity and your relationship to the Child before we can proceed with your request, particularly a request to access a Child’s Personal Information. We will use any such Personal Information only to validate the request. We will fulfill any valid request to review, update or delete any such Personal Information within a reasonable time period.

_Security of Information Collected on Our Children’s Platforms_

We implement and maintain technical and organizational measures to help secure Personal Information collected through our Children’s Platforms. We host Personal Information in secure, cloud-based environments that use firewalls, encryption and other industry-standard technologies in an effort to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.  

While we strive to maintain the security of your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that information security measures are fail-safe or guarantee that Personal Information on a Platform may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization.

**COOKIE** **NOTICE**

We use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons, to collect and store information when you visit our Platforms. A “cookie” is a small data file that a website transfers to a user’s device and is stored on the user’s browser. As a user moves from one page or one screen to another, a cookie is used to tell us that it is the same device and to remember your preferences. A “web beacon” (also referred to as a “clear gif” or “pixel tag”) is a one-pixel image (which may be visible or transparent), which may be embedded on a web page or in an e-mail message, and which may also provide us with information about usage of that page or e-mail message, including if and when you have opened it.

_Types of Cookies We Use_

We might use both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies last for as long as you are using your browser, while persistent cookies will last for some time after you close your browser. The time that persistent cookies last is dependent on your browser configuration and the lifespan of each cookie.

These cookies may be “first party” cookies, which are served by us, or “third party” cookies, which are served by a domain other than ours. While we allow third parties to access the Platforms to place cookies on users’ devices, the information those cookies supply is controlled by the third party and subject to their privacy policy.

The Platforms use four types of cookies: essential, functional, analytics, and marketing cookies.

Marketing cookies are not served on our Children’s Platforms.

_How We Use Cookies_

We use the information that is automatically collected through cookies to support our operations, analysis, and promotion of the Platforms. This includes the following:

_Disabling, Deleting, or Opting Out of Cookies_

You may visit the “Cookie Preferences” link at the bottom of each page on our Sites to make choices about cookies we and third parties place on our Platforms. If you do not or no longer want to have cookies placed on your browser by third parties, many of them also offer ways to opt out. Most browsers also allow at least some control of most cookies through browser settings. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser to decline cookies. You may also delete existing cookies through your browser.

**PRIVACY POLICIES OF OTHER WEBSITES WE LINK TO**

Our Platforms may link to other websites or apps, including content offered by third parties that we do not control and whose privacy and data collection practices may differ from ours (“Third Party Platforms”). We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Platforms, including the information or content contained within them.

When you go via our link to Third Party Platforms, you become subject to their Terms of Use and privacy policies rather than ours. You should review these other website privacy policies regarding any Personal Information that they may collect about you.

**JOB APPLICANTS**

When you visit the Careers portion of the website, we collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in connection with your job application. This includes but is not limited to business and personal contact information, professional credentials and skills, educational and work history and other information of the type that may be included in a resume. This may also include diversity information that you voluntarily provide. We use this information on the basis of our legitimate business interests to facilitate our recruitment activities and process employment applications, such as by evaluating a job candidate for an employment activity, to monitor recruitment statistics and to respond to surveys. We may also use this information to provide improved administration of the services and as otherwise necessary (i) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us, (ii) to protect and defend our or others’ rights or property, (iii) in connection with a legal investigation and (iv) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use.
