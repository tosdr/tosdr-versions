-------

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Internxt and the other Company Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
----------------------------------

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH INTERNXT AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Internxt (a) waive your and Internxt respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement or the Services resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and Internxt's respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Internxt will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

Any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services is personal to you and Internxt, and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Internxt will be sent by e-mail to Internxt at hello@internxt.com. Notice to you will be by email to the then-current email address in your Account. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Internxt cannot agree on how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Internxt may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 17, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 17.1, file a claim in court.

Any arbitration will occur in Spain. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located in Spain will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.

This Agreement and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

Governing Law and Venue
-----------------------

This Agreement and your access to and use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Spain, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Spain any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties arising out or relating to this Agreement that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the courts of the Spain.

Severability
------------

If any term, clause or provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of this Agreement.

Termination or Suspension

All rights and licenses granted to you under this Agreement will immediately be revoked upon our termination of the Agreement or our suspension of your access to the Services, and you must immediately submit payment for any fees payable to Internxt under the Agreement (as specified in the Storage Terms). Internxt users can pay for a lifetime plan. A lifetime plan has the duration of up to 99 years. Lifetime accounts come with a standard 30 day money-back guarantee, which covers the rest of our plans.

We calculate availability based upon the service records we maintain. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of any scheduled maintenance.

Storage Platform
----------------

The Storage Services enable you to store data and other materials (“Storage Materials”) via a distributed network of third-party devices (“Storage Nodes”) that comprise the Storage Platform. The Storage Platform is an interconnected set of Storage Nodes that independently operate open-source software to facilitate the storage of your Storage Materials. Users acting as Storage Nodes acknowledge that they must comply with EU GDPR Privacy Law. The Storage Services are designed to encrypt Storage Materials locally on your device and then facilitate the distribution of such encrypted data fragments to the Storage Nodes. The Storage Platform and Storage Nodes are not operated or maintained by Internxt, and Internxt has no responsibility or liability for the Storage Platform or Storage Nodes. The Storage Services enable you to protect against loss of your Storage Materials due to the failure of any individual Storage Node by allowing you to configure the redundancy and distribution of your Storage Materials. You are solely responsible for your use of the Storage Platform, including for configurations that you deem appropriate to maintain access to your Storage Materials in a manner that meets your expectations. In order to use the Storage Services, you will need to register for an account (“Account”). In connection with your creation of any Account, you will (i) provide accurate, current and complete Account information, (ii) maintain and promptly update your Account information as necessary, (iii) maintain the security of your Account, including by not using the same password for the Storage Services that you use for third-party services, (iv) not disclose your password or private keys to any third party, and (v) immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any unauthorized activities in connection with your Account or the Storage Services. You acknowledge and agree that if you lose your password, you may be unable to recover any Storage Materials. One same person cannot hold various free Internxt accounts. Internxt reserves the right to modify the features or storage capacity of its free plans at any time without any prior warning.

Storage Materials
-----------------

(a) Internxt will not be responsible for any loss, misuse, or deletion of Storage Materials or any failure of any Storage Materials to be stored or encrypted. You are solely responsible for backing up any Storage Materials.

(b) You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Storage Services to store your Storage Materials via the Storage Platform, and for maintaining appropriate security of your Storage Materials, which may include the use of encryption. We reserve the right at any time, without notice, to remove, reject or delete any Storage Materials that contain plain text data or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement (including Internxt Terms of Use relating to User Content).

(c) You are solely responsible for ensuring that any processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services is in compliance with all applicable laws. We make no representations or warranties regarding the suitability of the Storage Services for the processing of any particular types of data. You will provide all notices to, and obtain any consents from, third parties as required by applicable law in connection with the processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services. You must not process any Storage Materials that include sensitive data that require heightened security protections, including any (i) “protected health information,” as defined under HIPAA, (ii) “cardholder data,” as defined by the PCI DSS, or (iii) “Sensitive Personal Data” as defined under the EU Directive 95/46/EC as enacted in the member states of the European Union.

Payment
-------

(a) We will provide notice via the Storage Services of the fees applicable to use of the Storage Services ('Fees'). All Fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes unless stated otherwise, which are your sole responsibility. We will provide notice at least 30 days in advance of any increase to the Fees.

(b) Except where otherwise indicated via the Storage Services, we will charge all Fees to a payment method designated by you via the Storage Services that is acceptable to us. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Storage Services and authorize us to charge all Fees to that method. If your payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right to use the Storage Services may be suspended automatically. Fees will be charged on a monthly basis based on the prior month’s usage. You can avoid incurring Fees at any time by discontinuing your use of the Storage Services to store your Storage Materials.

(c) Users who do not log in to their account for a period of one year will be considered inactive. Users will receive an email notice 7 days prior to reaching inactive status. Once an account reaches that status, its files will be removed from the network to free up space for those free users who are actively using their account.

(d) Accounts on any of our premium plans who fail to renew their plan within a period of 7 days will be terminated.

(e) All users who buy any of Internxt's premium plans will be eligible for a 30 day refund, unless they already receive a 30 day trial period of any of Internxt's premium plan. After those first 30 days using any of our premium plans have passed, no refund will be applicable. To request a refund, you should reach out to us via email, at hello@internxt.com.

(f) Storage Nodes agree to let Internxt generate invoices on their behalf, so that both parties can legally justify the payment Internxt sends to Storage Nodes every month. The invoice will be issued by the Storage Nodes (with the personal details he specifies at sign up), to Internxt. Storage Nodes can contact us and request those invoices at any time.

Effect of Suspension or Termination
-----------------------------------

If your access to the Storage Services is suspended or terminated, you will no longer have access to the Storage Materials processed via the Storage Services for storage in the Storage Platform, and your Storage Materials may not be recoverable. If we terminate or suspend your access to the Storage Services for reasons other than your breach of the Agreement, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you an opportunity to retrieve your Storage Materials via the Storage Services. We will terminate any free accounts that have no activity for one year (this includes any account that has not uploaded, downloaded, shared or modified a file in a period of one year). We will also terminate accounts under any of our paid plans, that fail to renew their plan after 7 days from the payment renewal deadline. Appropriate notice will be given to the user to try to avoid account termination.

Miscellaneous
-------------

The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Internxt relating to your access to and use of our Services. We may assign our rights and obligations under the Agreement. The failure of Internxt to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the Agreement where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control. Except as otherwise provided in herein, the Agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.

For example, we collect information you provide when you create an account, subscribe to our updates, respond to a survey, fill out a form, request customer support or communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your email address, survey responses, and any other information you choose to provide. If you use our Storage Services, our third-party service provider may collect your payment method information for use in connection with your payments for storage.

Information collected by cookies and other tracking technologies via our services.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We and our service providers use various technologies to collect information when you interact with our websites and mobile apps, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your device when you visit a website, which enable us to collect information about your device identifiers, web browsers used to access the Services, pages or features viewed, time spent on pages, mobile app performance and links clicked. Web beacons (or pixel tags) are electronic images that may be used in our web Services or emails to help deliver cookies, count website visits, understand usage and determine the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns.

We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as when logging into your Storage Services account by using your account credentials for a separate third-party service. We will receive information from that service as indicated in the relevant third party’s authorization screen.

Using Internxt's Core software makes your computer part of a distributed network. This means your computer may communicate with many other computers. As part of this process, those other nodes can store some information about your computer and your interactions. None of this information is dangerous to share with the network. Your computer shares a lot of it every day when you browse the web. We firmly believe that you have the right to be aware of the information you're sharing, and be able to make decisions about your own privacy. Here's a list of some things that other people can learn about your computer. IP Address: This is your computer's address on the Internet. This needs to be shared so that other nodes' messages can reach your computer. IP-associated information: Using your IP address, it is often possible to look up an approximate location (usually what city you are likely in) as well as your ISP. Network information: When you communicate with another node, it can record how long it takes your node to respond, and test your internet connection's bandwidth. Node ID: This is a pseudonym for your computer. It's a long group of random numbers that can be used to identify a node on the network. You need to send this out so that other nodes can identify and contact your node. Disk space information: In order to negotiate storage contracts, your computer has to let other nodes know some information about how much it can store. If you are not comfortable sharing this information, we suggest you do not run Internxt's Core program.

We may allow others to provide analytics services on our behalf in connection with our Services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and apps, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, app performance, time spent on pages and links clicked. This information may be used by Company and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand your online activity.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
----------------------------------

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH INTERNXT AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Internxt (a) waive your and Internxt respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement or the Services resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and Internxt's respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Internxt will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

Any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services is personal to you and Internxt, and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Internxt will be sent by e-mail to Internxt at hello@internxt.com. Notice to you will be by email to the then-current email address in your Account. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Internxt cannot agree on how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Internxt may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 17, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 17.1, file a claim in court.

Any arbitration will occur in Spain. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located in Spain will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.

This Agreement and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

Governing Law and Venue
-----------------------

This Agreement and your access to and use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Spain, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Spain any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties arising out or relating to this Agreement that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the courts of the Spain.

Severability
------------

If any term, clause or provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of this Agreement.

We calculate availability based upon the service records we maintain. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of any scheduled maintenance.

Storage Platform
----------------

The Storage Services enable you to store data and other materials (“Storage Materials”) via a distributed network of third-party devices (“Storage Nodes”) that comprise the Storage Platform. The Storage Platform is an interconnected set of Storage Nodes that independently operate open-source software to facilitate the storage of your Storage Materials. Users acting as Storage Nodes acknowledge that they must comply with EU GDPR Privacy Law. The Storage Services are designed to encrypt Storage Materials locally on your device and then facilitate the distribution of such encrypted data fragments to the Storage Nodes. The Storage Platform and Storage Nodes are not operated or maintained by Internxt, and Internxt has no responsibility or liability for the Storage Platform or Storage Nodes. The Storage Services enable you to protect against loss of your Storage Materials due to the failure of any individual Storage Node by allowing you to configure the redundancy and distribution of your Storage Materials. You are solely responsible for your use of the Storage Platform, including for configurations that you deem appropriate to maintain access to your Storage Materials in a manner that meets your expectations. In order to use the Storage Services, you will need to register for an account (“Account”). In connection with your creation of any Account, you will (i) provide accurate, current and complete Account information, (ii) maintain and promptly update your Account information as necessary, (iii) maintain the security of your Account, including by not using the same password for the Storage Services that you use for third-party services, (iv) not disclose your password or private keys to any third party, and (v) immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any unauthorized activities in connection with your Account or the Storage Services. You acknowledge and agree that if you lose your password, you may be unable to recover any Storage Materials. One same person cannot hold various free Internxt accounts. Internxt reserves the right to modify the features or storage capacity of its free plans at any time without any prior warning.

Storage Materials
-----------------

(a) Internxt will not be responsible for any loss, misuse, or deletion of Storage Materials or any failure of any Storage Materials to be stored or encrypted. You are solely responsible for backing up any Storage Materials.

(b) You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Storage Services to store your Storage Materials via the Storage Platform, and for maintaining appropriate security of your Storage Materials, which may include the use of encryption. We reserve the right at any time, without notice, to remove, reject or delete any Storage Materials that contain plain text data or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement (including Internxt Terms of Use relating to User Content).

(c) You are solely responsible for ensuring that any processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services is in compliance with all applicable laws. We make no representations or warranties regarding the suitability of the Storage Services for the processing of any particular types of data. You will provide all notices to, and obtain any consents from, third parties as required by applicable law in connection with the processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services. You must not process any Storage Materials that include sensitive data that require heightened security protections, including any (i) “protected health information,” as defined under HIPAA, (ii) “cardholder data,” as defined by the PCI DSS, or (iii) “Sensitive Personal Data” as defined under the EU Directive 95/46/EC as enacted in the member states of the European Union.

Payment
-------

(a) We will provide notice via the Storage Services of the fees applicable to use of the Storage Services ('Fees'). All Fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes unless stated otherwise, which are your sole responsibility. We will provide notice at least 30 days in advance of any increase to the Fees.

(b) Except where otherwise indicated via the Storage Services, we will charge all Fees to a payment method designated by you via the Storage Services that is acceptable to us. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Storage Services and authorize us to charge all Fees to that method. If your payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right to use the Storage Services may be suspended automatically. Fees will be charged on a monthly basis based on the prior month’s usage. You can avoid incurring Fees at any time by discontinuing your use of the Storage Services to store your Storage Materials.

(c) Users who do not log in to their account for a period of one year will be considered inactive. Users will receive an email notice 7 days prior to reaching inactive status. Once an account reaches that status, its files will be removed from the network to free up space for those free users who are actively using their account.

(d) Accounts on any of our premium plans who fail to renew their plan within a period of 7 days will be terminated.

(e) All users who buy any of Internxt's premium plans will be eligible for a 30 day refund, unless they already receive a 30 day trial period of any of Internxt's premium plan. After those first 30 days using any of our premium plans have passed, no refund will be applicable. To request a refund, you should reach out to us via email, at hello@internxt.com.

(f) Storage Nodes agree to let Internxt generate invoices on their behalf, so that both parties can legally justify the payment Internxt sends to Storage Nodes every month. The invoice will be issued by the Storage Nodes (with the personal details he specifies at sign up), to Internxt. Storage Nodes can contact us and request those invoices at any time.

Effect of Suspension or Termination
-----------------------------------

If your access to the Storage Services is suspended or terminated, you will no longer have access to the Storage Materials processed via the Storage Services for storage in the Storage Platform, and your Storage Materials may not be recoverable. If we terminate or suspend your access to the Storage Services for reasons other than your breach of the Agreement, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you an opportunity to retrieve your Storage Materials via the Storage Services. We will terminate any free accounts that have no activity for one year (this includes any account that has not uploaded, downloaded, shared or modified a file in a period of one year). We will also terminate accounts under any of our paid plans, that fail to renew their plan after 7 days from the payment renewal deadline. Appropriate notice will be given to the user to try to avoid account termination.

Miscellaneous
-------------

The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Internxt relating to your access to and use of our Services. We may assign our rights and obligations under the Agreement. The failure of Internxt to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the Agreement where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control. Except as otherwise provided in herein, the Agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.

Information you provide to us
-----------------------------

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information you provide when you create an account, subscribe to our updates, respond to a survey, fill out a form, request customer support or communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your email address, survey responses, and any other information you choose to provide. If you use our Storage Services, our third-party service provider may collect your payment method information for use in connection with your payments for storage.

Information collected by cookies and other tracking technologies via our services.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We and our service providers use various technologies to collect information when you interact with our websites and mobile apps, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your device when you visit a website, which enable us to collect information about your device identifiers, web browsers used to access the Services, pages or features viewed, time spent on pages, mobile app performance and links clicked. Web beacons (or pixel tags) are electronic images that may be used in our web Services or emails to help deliver cookies, count website visits, understand usage and determine the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns.

We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as when logging into your Storage Services account by using your account credentials for a separate third-party service. We will receive information from that service as indicated in the relevant third party’s authorization screen.

Using Internxt's Core software makes your computer part of a distributed network. This means your computer may communicate with many other computers. As part of this process, those other nodes can store some information about your computer and your interactions. None of this information is dangerous to share with the network. Your computer shares a lot of it every day when you browse the web. We firmly believe that you have the right to be aware of the information you're sharing, and be able to make decisions about your own privacy. Here's a list of some things that other people can learn about your computer. IP Address: This is your computer's address on the Internet. This needs to be shared so that other nodes' messages can reach your computer. IP-associated information: Using your IP address, it is often possible to look up an approximate location (usually what city you are likely in) as well as your ISP. Network information: When you communicate with another node, it can record how long it takes your node to respond, and test your internet connection's bandwidth. Node ID: This is a pseudonym for your computer. It's a long group of random numbers that can be used to identify a node on the network. You need to send this out so that other nodes can identify and contact your node. Disk space information: In order to negotiate storage contracts, your computer has to let other nodes know some information about how much it can store. If you are not comfortable sharing this information, we suggest you do not run Internxt's Core program.

We may allow others to provide analytics services on our behalf in connection with our Services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and apps, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, app performance, time spent on pages and links clicked. This information may be used by Company and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand your online activity.

Security
--------

Internxt takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

Transfer of information to governing authorities
------------------------------------------------

Internxt is based in Spain and the information we collect is governed by Spanish law. By accessing or using our Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to Spain and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under your local law. Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Since Internxt uses client-side end-to-end encryption, it cannot know the content a user has under his Drive account.
