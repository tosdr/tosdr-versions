### Usage of Google AdSense

On our website, we also use the functions of the online advertising service Google AdSense. Google AdSense is a service of Google Inc. ("Google"), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google AdSense is a Google service that displays Google advertisements from advertisers on third-party websites. By integrating Google AdSense we provide Google with appropriate advertising space on our website. Google AdSense uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are saved on your device and that enabled the website to conduct an analysis of the websites you visited. Google AdSense may also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Via these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on the pages of this offer can be evaluated. The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the usage of our website (including your IP address) and the delivery of advertising formats will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries. This way, Google can reconstruct on which websites the usage of advertising media took place in order to be able to allocate a commission to the website operator. Information on Google’s existing Privacy Shield certification and other relevant data relating to Google’s processing of data in the scope of using Google services can be found in:

Through the integration of Google AdSense, we pursue the purpose of being able to offer you interest-based advertisements, and to be able to finance our offer through the successful use of advertising media. The data will only be stored as long as it is necessary for the provision of this function. You can find the Google Advertisment Privacy Policy here: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
