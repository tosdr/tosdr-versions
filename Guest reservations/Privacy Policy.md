Guest Reservations controls the processing of personal information and data on the Site as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We value your privacy rights and strive to provide flexibility with how your personal information is used and shared. Subject to applicable law, you have certain rights and choices with respect to your personal information. Generally, we adhere to the following privacy rights described below, subject to certain limitations authorized by law:

* The right to know and access: You have the right to know what information we have collected about you, where and how we collected it, whether we sell or share the information we have collected about you, and the third parties we might have disclosed your information to. You also have the right to request access to the information we have collected about you in an easily understandable and accessible format.
* The right to amend: You have the right to correct or update personal information we have about you that is inaccurate or incomplete.
* The right to delete: You have the right to delete personal information that we have collected about you (subject to certain exceptions).
* The right to limit: You have the right to limit how we process certain kinds of data about you, for example, any sensitive data.
* The right to opt-out: You have the right to opt-out of certain data practices. For example, you can unsubscribe from our marketing communications (please note that we may still send non-marketing messages, and that consent to receiving marketing communications is not mandatory to use the Services). You have the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information to the extent applicable. You can also opt out of the use of automated decision-making technology if applicable.
* The right to non-discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.
* State Specific Laws: Several states have enacted privacy laws that may apply to you, including if you are a resident of Delaware ,Texas, Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah, Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, Oregon, Montana, Florida, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and California.

Please note that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of public content.
* International Laws: Depending on where you reside, you may have additional rights. For example, generally, residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) have the right to access information we hold about you and to ask that your information be corrected, updated, or erased, and the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing of your information. Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal data is your consent, performance of a contract, or where the collection and use is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights. You may withdraw your consent to our collection and use of your personal data. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your information used in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
* Other Laws: If certain other privacy laws apply to you that afford you with additional rights, please contact us to make a request.

If you would like to make a privacy request or have any questions, please contact us as described below. If you are making a privacy request, we may ask you to verify your identity and request before taking further action.

### Financial Incentives

Any difference in price or rate, such as a discount, will be reasonably related to the value of the data. For more information, see the section on Accounts above. If you want to withdraw from the offering, please contact us as described below.

### DNT

We do not support Do Not Track ("DNT"). Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the preferences or settings page of your web browser.
