Copyright Guideline
-------------------

#### 1\. Copyright

Copyright is a legal right given to authors or creators of original works including literature, music, paintings, films and photos in order to control uses of their works.  
Authors or copyright holders have certain excusive rights to protect their works.  
  
"To control uses of work" means that a copyright holder retains the rights to copy, modify or transfer their own works.  
For example, if a picture is uploaded and shared on the Internet without the copyright holder's permission, the uploader's act is violating the copyright.  
  
Copyright is the exclusive right and its holders can specify who, where and how to use their works.  
  
The following examples show you some copyrightable contents:

1. \* TV programs  
    \* Films and the trailers  
    \* Music and the lyrics  
    \* Advertisements  
    \* Texts in books and magazines  
    \* Photos and images
  
  
 

#### 2\. Copyright Infringement

'Copyright Infringement' happens when someone or something infringes a copyright holder's right to control uses of their works. For example a person who does not have the copyright copies, distributes, performs, discloses the copyrighted material or creates any derivation of it without permission of copyright holder.
