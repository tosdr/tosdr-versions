Our Sites use cookies for many reasons. We use cookies and IP addresses to obtain personal data from online visitors, and also to give them the best possible personalized online experience. With these cookies we may collect certain information about you, such as user interactions, device information, and browsing behavior.

_**AdChoices Notice**_

At times we display ads both on our Sites and on the websites of third parties. When you visit one of our Sites or view ads that we serve elsewhere online, you may see different kinds of ads, such as text ads next to search results or video ads on web pages. Sometimes, these ads are based on the content of the pages on which they appear. Other times, these ads are generated by matching that ad to your interests, based on your online activities collected over time. With interest-based advertising, the goal is to show you the most relevant ads.

We support the [Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/obaprinciples). Ads that we place online using interest-based data are expected to be delivered with the Advertising Option Icon to help you understand how your data is being collected and used and to provide choices for people who want more control. The Icon looks like this:

![](https://www.mars.com/sites/g/files/dfsbuz106/files/2024-11/advertisting-options-icon.png)

By clicking on the Icon when it appears, you can review and follow information about online interest-based ads, including who is collecting and using your online data, how you can opt-out from these ads, and more. To stop receiving interest-based ads from any of our Sites, you can also opt-out by <a href=" https:="" privacyportal-eu-cdn.onetrust.com="" dsarwebform="" draft="" target="\_blank">clicking here. Opting out does not mean you will no longer see ads from us online, just that the online ads from us you do see will not be based on your specific interests.

Depending on where you live, you may be able to access one convenient place to indicate your preferences, including the option to make one “universal” opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities:

In the United States, visit this site: [Ad Choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).    
In Canada, visit this site: [Your Ad Choices](http://youradchoices.ca/).   
In the EU, visit this site: [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

When you opt-out using these methods, a cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you have opted-out of interest-based advertising. If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt-out again.

_**What if you don't want cookies?**_

**1.** **Privacy Preference Center**

 Sale or sharing of Personal Data

To personalize our ads and marketing experiences, or to personalize our ads for current job openings, we work with ad and analytics partners, ad networks, and social media sites. These partnerships may be considered a ”sale” or “sharing” under some US laws, even when no money changes hands.  

The personal data we might “sell” or “share” includes your basic name and contact information, online activity information, customer records, and sales data. When you login to your account on a web page where cookies are present, that may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your personal data.
