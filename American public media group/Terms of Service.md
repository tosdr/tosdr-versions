    * any UGC that violates or infringes upon the rights of others, including UGC which violates the patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, trade secret rights, confidentiality rights, contract rights, or any other rights of any individual, living or deceased, or any legal entity;
        
    * any UGC that contains the image, name or likeness of anyone other than yourself, unless (i) that person is at least eighteen (18) years old and you have first obtained his/her express permission or (ii) that person is under eighteen (18) years old but you are his/her parent or legal guardian;
        
    * any request for or solicitation of any personal or private information from any individual;
