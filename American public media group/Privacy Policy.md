 APMG has provided this Policy so that you will know what information APMG collects, how APMG uses this information, the types of third parties with whom APMG may share this information, and some of the choices that are available to you. Please read this Policy carefully before using this Site.

Your use of this Site is also subject to any applicable Terms and Conditions or other agreements we may have with you. You may find the applicable Terms and Conditions here.

For example, certain pages of this Site may contain Privacy Notices providing more details about the information we collect on those particular pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. In other cases, specific Privacy Notices may be required to comply with the privacy laws of one of the locations in which we do business.

In situations where a Privacy Notice contains information that conflicts with this Privacy Policy, then the Privacy Notice takes priority.

This Site uses different types of cookies to, among other things, automatically recognize you when you return to this Site, store information regarding your preferences (including preferred payment methods), serve relevant advertising to you, personalize content for you, provide social media functionality, and analyze our website traffic and audience. Cookies may collect, transmit or store information that does not reference any other personal information, such as usage data, or cookies may collect, transmit, or store information that does reference other personal information, such as name and credit card information. You may have the option to set your browser, application, or device to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, or delete cookies.

* **Web beacons and other technologies** – This Site may use other tracking tools, including web beacons, which are small electronic images embedded in web content and email messages that are not ordinarily visible to users.  Web beacons allow us to track pages and content accessed and viewed by users, as well as to monitor email readership.  We may also use pixels to track visitors.
