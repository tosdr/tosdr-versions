**7\. TRANSMISSION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES AND TO THIRD COUNTRIES**

**a) Transmission of applications to Business Customers and visibility of profile data:** Transmission of job applications: When You apply for a job on our Platform as a Job Seeker, we forward your application to the appropriate Business Customer. You can also use the “Apply with” function to grant a Business Customer access to certain information stored in your JobCloud Account. In such cases, we will send the application stored in your JobCloud Account to the appropriate Business Customer. Please note that in such case, your personal data will be transmitted to the appropriate Business Customer, who may possibly keep a copy. Once your personal information has been transmitted, JobCloud can no longer retrieve it from the third parties who have accessed it. Your personal information may therefore, theoretically, be retransmitted to others.

Visibility of profile data: You also have the option of making your profile visible to third parties by selecting the “Visible” setting, which authorizes us to make your personal data available to employers and/or recruiters for recruitment purposes (“CV database” function; for more detailed information, see our [Terms of Use](https://www.jobcloud.ch/c/en/terms/#job-seekers)). Please note that if You make your personal data visible, it may be downloaded in unencrypted form by Business Customers (including outside Switzerland) and, in theory, may be forwarded by them from out of their JobCloud Account to third parties worldwide in unencrypted form. Once You have posted your personal information in the “visible” mode, we can no longer retrieve it from the third parties who have accessed it.

Generally: once your personal information is in the possession of third parties, we therefore have no control over the storage, utilization or privacy/protection of your personal data (particularly in the case of CVs). With that in mind, please do not enter any personal information that is classified as sensitive personal data under the Swiss FADP and characterized as a special category of personal information under the EU GDPR (cf. clause 1 above) ) or any other data that You do not wish to be publicly accessible. Theoretically, your personal data could therefore wind up in countries with a level of data protection inferior to that of Switzerland. In all the above-mentioned cases, the subsequent processing of your personal information by the Business Customer is governed by the data protection policy of the Business Customer in question. The Business Customer is liable for complying with all applicable data protection provisions (including with respect to the erasure of your data after completion of the application process).

If You have any questions about the processing of your data (e.g. questions about data erasure), please get in touch directly with the relevant Business Customer.

Naturally, JobCloud makes every effort to protect your data as well as possible, especially through agreements with the Business Customers.

**b) Posting of job offers**: As a Business Customer, job offers that You post via JobCloud may contain personal data (e.g. the name and e-mail address of the HR employee in charge of job applications). By posting your job offers on our Platforms according to your instructions, we make such personal data accessible to third parties (especially Job Seekers) who visit our Platforms. You are responsible for ensuring that we are authorized to post such data (see clause 1 above).

**c) Commissioned data processors:** we use the following categories of data processors to provide our services: hosting providers, Cloud Service providers, shipping companies, payment service providers, providers of parsing and matching solutions, advertising providers, tracking technology providers and Social Media Platforms. Such data processors are bound by non-disclosure agreements and it is prohibited for them to use your data for their own purposes or any other purposes.

**d) Transmission to third countries:** our commissioned data processors may be domiciled anywhere in the world and thus outside Switzerland or even the European Union. JobCloud shall ensure that a transmission is made only to such countries that have a data protection standard equivalent to Switzerland or the EU and only to data processors that have entered into data transmission agreements with JobCloud based on the agreements drawn up and approved by the European Commission, so-called standard contract clauses (EU GDPR Art. 46 (2)) and therefore guarantee a data protection standard comparable to Switzerland or the EU. If You have questions about the specific data processors that we employ, or would like to receive a copy of the data protection guarantees, please address your question according to the contact information indicated in clause 11.6.

**8\. JOBCLOUD ON MOBILE DEVICES**

We offer free apps for a variety of mobile devices and a version of our standard website adapted for mobile devices. Such apps and websites for mobile devices collect and process your personal data in the same way as our website; this Privacy Notice applies. If You grant your consent, we will send You push messages with information about your job search.

**9\. JOBCLOUD AS COMMISSIONED DATA PROCESSOR**

**a) Use of JobCloud Applicant Tracking System:** Business Customers have the option of using the JobCloud Applicant Tracking System (ATS) in accordance with [JobCloud’s General Terms and Conditions](https://www.jobcloud.ch/c/en/terms/#employers)for employers and recruiters, in which case a data processor relationship arises between the Business Customer (as the data controller) and JobCloud (as the data processor).

**b) Transmission of job applications:** The data processor agreement between the Business Customer and JobCloud provides the basis for transmission of your applications to the Business Customer (i.e. the employer or recruiter).

**10\. YOUR RIGHTS**

**10.1 INFORMATION, COMPLETION AND RECTIFICATION**

You may inquire about your stored personal data, complete your data or rectify incorrect personal data at any time by sending an e-mail to [dataprotection@jobcloud.ch](mailto:dataprotection@jobcloud.ch). We shall promptly respond to your request.

**10.2 DISCREPANCIES**

If your personal data is processed on the basis of EU GDPR Art. 6 (1)(f), You may object to the processing at any time by sending an e-mail to [dataprotection@jobcloud.ch](mailto:dataprotection@jobcloud.ch). In that case, we shall promptly cease to process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing that override your own interests, rights and freedoms, or unless such processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

**10.3 ERASURE**

In addition, You may have us erase your stored personal data by sending an e-mail to [dataprotection@jobcloud.ch](mailto:dataprotection@jobcloud.ch). Job Seekers with JobCloud Account through OneLog can also make a corresponding request in their account. In that case, we shall promptly erase your personal data irrevocably, as soon as all the existing agreements and other legal relationships with You have been completely wound up, unless we are required to retain such information by law or it useful to handle the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims. Please note that, after erasure, You will no longer be able to retrieve the data You provided. 

**10.4 RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT**

In accordance with the applicable legal system, You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies, particularly in the Member State of your habitual place of residence or place of work or the place of the presumed infringement, if You believe that the processing of the personal data concerning You infringes the EU GDPR (if the EU GDPR is applicable to the processing in question). The supervisory authority with which the complaint is lodged shall inform the complainant of the status and the outcome of the complaint, including the option of a judicial remedy under EU GDPR Article 78.

**10.5 DATA PORTABILITY**

In accordance with the applicable legal system, data subjects may be entitled to receive the personal data that they have provided to JobCloud, in a structured, standard and machine-readable format and to transmit or cause such data to be transmitted to another data controller.

All third parties who process usage data on our behalf are contractually committed to measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data processed.

We may use “pixel tags” (also called beacons) placed on webpages, apps, emails or ads that enable us to identify users when providing our services and track interactions with our platforms and apps.

Through “Software Development Kits” (“SDKs”) we collect information about app usage. By seeing how an app is used with the information gathered through SDKs, an app can be analysed accordingly and improved.

A website should be structured in such a way that you, as a visitor, feel comfortable on the site and can easily find your way around. Thanks to the analysis tools, we can make our websites more attractive and we receive feedback about their quality.

JobCloud uses marketing cookies to ensure that users get more relevant advertising messages by ensuring optimal targeting of the ads; we also use such cookies to measure the effectiveness of the ads.
