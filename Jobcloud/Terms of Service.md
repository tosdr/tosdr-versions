For this purpose, company information (particularly the company name, company address, and, if applicable, different billing address telephone number, industry and number of employees) and information of a contact person (including name, e-mail address and telephone number) are required. For Business Customers who acquire JobCloud services by telephone or by way of a written agreement and who do not yet have a JobCloud Account, JobCloud will automatically create a JobCloud Account upon conclusion of the contract. Upon completion of the registration of the JobCloud Account, the Business Customer will receive an e-mail with the login details for the JobCloud Account.

**4\. USING THE PLATFORMS**

**4.1 JOB ADS AND COMPANY PROFILES**

Job ads must be posted in the Business Customer’s name and contain the name and contact information of a contact person of the Business Customer. The Business Customer bears the sole responsibility for the content of its job ads. The Business Customer guarantees that all information contained in a job ad is accurate and up to date. For security and data protection reasons, JobCloud masks the contact information, especially the e-mail address of the contact person, when publishing a job ad.

Only job ads and/or company profiles may be published on JobCloud Platforms. Job ads and company profiles must comply with all legal requirements and in particular must not infringe any intellectual property of third parties, rights to privacy or other third-party rights. Business customers undertake not to post any illegal content via JobCloud, particularly content of racist, pornographic or personality-infringing nature. The following content is particularly inadmissible:

* indecent or offensive job offers or profiles;
* several job offers or profiles combined in a single post;
* job offers with inaccurate or missing job titles or content;
* job offers for multilevel marketing, snowball systems, at-home work (within the meaning of art. 351 et seqq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations and the At-Home Work Act \[Heimarbeitsgesetz\]), gifting circles, etc.;
* job offers with erotic content or for escort services;
* mystery shopping offers;
* advanced training and continuing education offers;
* job offers that refer to offers of other positions or to communication products or other products;
* job offers with insufficient identification, insufficient contact details or merely a P.O. Box as the address (with the exception of numbered (anonymous) listings offered by JobCloud).

Each job offer posted must refer to a job vacancy that actually needs to be filled. Business Customers undertake not to reactivate a job offer until a new vacancy needs to be filled.

The Business Customer warrants that the content shared with JobCloud is free of malware.

Until final clarification of the facts, JobCloud may take potentially illegal or infringing content offline without prior notification of the Business Customer. The claim for payment remains valid even if the content is taken offline. If the measure subsequently turns out to be unnecessary, JobCloud will extend the contract period by the period of offline placement.

JobCloud reserves the right to remove job ads and/or company profiles with inadmissible content from the Platforms at its sole discretion without prior notice and without stating any reasons. JobCloud also reserves the right to block Business Customers and/or their JobCloud Account from further services of JobCloud at its sole discretion and to terminate the underlying contract for good cause. Any payments already made will not be refunded.

**4.2 THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS**

The Business Customer undertakes to ensure that all content published by him on the Platforms or submitted to JobCloud for publication is unencumbered by any third-party rights. The Business Customer hereby guarantees that it has all rights necessary for publication of the content, particularly copyrights, trademark rights and design rights. The Business Customer undertakes to indemnify and hold JobCloud harmless from and against all loss or damage arising from a third-party claim asserted against JobCloud for infringement of proprietary rights on the grounds of publishing the Business Customer’s content.

If JobCloud is notified by a third party of a possible infringement of proprietary rights, the content in question will be taken offline without prior notification of the Business Customer until the matter is clarified. The claim for payment remains valid even if the content is taken offline. If the measure ultimately turns out not to be necessary, JobCloud will extend the contract period by the period of offline placement.

JobCloud further reserves the right to remove or modify any content regarding which an infringement of proprietary rights is claimed, at its sole discretion and without prior notice to the Business Customer. Furthermore, JobCloud reserves the right to block the Business Customer or his JobCloud Account from further services of JobCloud at its sole discretion and to terminate the underlying contract for good cause. Payments already made will not be refunded.

**4.3 LIMITATION OF PURPOSE**

Business Customers may use the Platforms and services provided by JobCloud exclusively in accordance with the applicable laws and may only use the personal data transmitted by JobCloud in the context of the provision of services in connection with the services of JobCloud and as specified on the Platforms and in the special product-specific terms and conditions. Business Customers may not use the personal data for purposes other than recruitment. In the event of improper use, which is to be determined at the sole discretion of JobCloud, JobCloud further reserves the right to block Business Customers and/or the associated JobCloud Accounts from further JobCloud services and to terminate the underlying contract for good cause. Any payments already made will not be refunded in this case. The assertion of further legal remedies, including possible claims for damages of JobCloud and/or JobCloud’s injured parties, is expressly reserved.

**5\. PAYMENT TERMS**

The price of fee-based services is shown in the agreement on the relevant fee-based service. The Business Customer’s obligation to pay for fee-based services arises upon conclusion of the respective contract. Unless agreed otherwise, the entire remuneration shall be due for payment and invoiced upon conclusion of the respective contract. Invoices of JobCloud shall be paid within 30 days after receipt of invoice without deductions and excluding set-off, unless other payment terms have been expressly agreed. In the event of late payment, default interest of 5% per annum and, from the second formal notice onwards, an additional reminder fee of CHF 50 will be charged. Claims asserted by the customer shall not entitle the customer to withhold agreed payments. JobCloud may commission third parties with the collection and is entitled to assign the invoice claim(s) to third parties. Any additional costs incurred by JobCloud in this context shall be borne by the Business Customer. If the Business Customer is in default with the payment of invoices, JobCloud is entitled to suspend the services without prior notice and to block the Business Customers and/or the corresponding JobCloud Account from further services of JobCloud. In addition, JobCloud is entitled to terminate the contract for good cause. If a staggered payment has been agreed and the Business Customer is in default with the payment of one instalment, such default shall render all outstanding instalments due and payable immediately.

**6\. USE OF DATA BY JOBCLOUD, DATA PROSSESSING AND DATA PROTECTION**

The protection of personal data is important to JobCloud. JobCloud therefore treats the Business Customers’ personal data with the greatest care at all times, in accordance with the applicable data protection regulations. The current version of the [Privacy Policy](https://www.jobcloud.ch/c/en/privacy-policy/) published on the respective platform of JobCloud shall apply. JobCloud considers itself to be a data processor in connection with the provision of an ATS and for “Programmatic Job Advertising”. Upon conclusion of these GTCs, the Business Customer therefore additionally concludes the [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.jobcloud.ch/c/en/dpa/) when using these services.

The Business Customer hereby grants JobCloud the right to use the data transmitted to JobCloud in anonymized form without restriction and to dispose of such anonymized data without limitation.

**7\. REVIEWS OF COMPANIES/EMPLOYERS**

Private users have the option of reviewing Business Customers in their role as employers by using the employer review platform. The following rules must be observed:

* Only employers for whom the private user works or has worked or to whom they have applied and been invited for an interview may be evaluated.
* All information about the employer and place of work must be complete and correct; no untrue statement of facts may be made about employers, their employees or other circumstances concerning the respective employer.
* Any mention of natural persons by name or information that makes it possible to identify a natural person (with the exception of one’s own person) must be refrained from.
* Private users may not link the information they provide to external content.

If an employer review exceeds the scope of permissible freedom of expression of opinion (e.g.in the case of abusive criticism), JobCloud shall promptly delete or edit the relevant employer review by changing or deleting the inadmissible content and/or require the private user to change the employer review accordingly. The Business Customer may comment on employer reviews at any time and thereby provide his perspective. Subject to legal claims, Business Customers shall not be entitled to demand the deletion or modification of employer reviews from JobCloud.

**8\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

All proprietary and intellectual property rights in JobCloud’s websites, Platforms and Apps, particularly copyrights and rights to trademarks, designs and know-how, shall remain with JobCloud.

JobCloud grants Business Customers a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Platforms and Apps in accordance with these GTCs for the duration of the contractual relationship. Any further publication, use, transfer or reproduction of the proprietary and intellectual property rights without the express consent of JobCloud is prohibited.

**9\. NO GUARANTEES**

JobCloud gives no guarantees regarding the Platforms, Apps or services offered by JobCloud; in particular, JobCloud does not guarantee:

* that content is up-to-date, accurate, complete or suitable for a particular intended purpose;
* that the posted job ads will be read or answered, or that the vacancy will be filled successfully;
* that transmitted content is free of malware; and
* that the Platforms and Apps will be available without interruptions or disturbances.

Although JobCloud performs regular backups. Nevertheless, data loss cannot be ruled out entirely.

**10\. LIABILITY** 

JobCloud shall be liable exclusively for loss or damage caused intentionally or through gross negligence.

JobCloud also publishes third-party offers and content and/or links to third-party offers or websites on its Platforms. JobCloud has no control over the content of external links and assumes no liability for the content of such external links, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability or suitability for specific purposes. Upon corresponding notification by users, illegal content will be removed immediately.

**11. DURATION OF AGREEMENT AND TERMINATION** 

**11.1 CONTRACT ON FREE SERVICES**

Upon registration of a JobCloud Account as well as with the use of free services, a contract is created between JobCloud and the relevant Business Customer. This contractual relationship shall exist for an indefinite period of time.

Without giving notice or stating any reasons, the Business Customer may terminate this contract and request JobCloud to delete the JobCloud Account at any time by sending a letter to JobCloud, Albisriederstrasse 253, 8047 Zurich or an e-mail to info@jobcloud.ch. In that case, JobCloud shall promptly delete the JobCloud Account and all data of the Business Customer, unless the data is necessary for the execution of the contractual relationship or for the assertion and/or enforcement of claims or other rights and JobCloud is not legally obligated to retain the data for further details on deletion, see our [Data Privacy Notice](https://www.jobcloud.ch/c/en/privacy-policy/).

JobCloud may also terminate the contract with the Business Customer at any time by letter or by e-mail without stating any reasons and without observing a notice period.

**11.2 AGREEMENT ON FEE-BASED SERVICE**

A contract for a fee-based service is concluded upon effective conclusion of a contract in accordance with clause 3 of the GTCs. The duration of the respective contract is indicated in the order confirmation or in the cooperation agreement.

The Business Customer may terminate the contract for a fee-based service in writing at any time without observing a notice period or stating any reasons, by sending a letter to JobCloud, Albisriederstrasse 253, 8047 Zurich or an e-mail to info@jobcloud.ch. In this case, JobCloud shall be released from all its performance obligations under the contract. The Business Customer remains obligated to pay the full fee to JobCloud. Upon receipt of the notice of termination, any fees not yet fully paid to JobCloud shall become due and payable. The Business Customer shall have no right to a refund of payments already made.

JobCloud may terminate the contract for a fee-based service at any time in writing without giving reasons and without observing a notice period by letter or by e-mail. If the termination is made by JobCloud during an ongoing fee-based service offer, the contract shall end with the complete provision of the products or services used by the Business Customer by JobCloud and the complete payment of the remuneration (if not already provided) by the Business Customer to JobCloud.

Moreover, both JobCloud and the Business Customer may unilaterally terminate the contract for a fee-based service with immediate effect for good cause if continuation of the contract cannot reasonably be expected of the terminating party in good faith. In such a case, both parties shall be released from their contractual obligations as soon as the termination becomes effective. There is no entitlement to a refund of payments already made. Signs of unlawful use of personal data by the Business Customer, for example, constitute good cause for the termination of the contract.

After the end of the contract, JobCloud is not obliged to retain the data and documents sent to it or to return the data to the Business Customer, unless retention or return has been expressly agreed or there is a statutory retention obligation.

**12\. CHANGES TO THESE GTCs**

**12.1. CHANGES TO THE GTCs WITH REGARD TO FREE SERVICES**

For the use of free services (this includes the use of the JobCloud Account), the General Terms and Conditions shall apply in their current form. JobCloud may amend these General Terms and Conditions at any time.

If a Business Customer does not agree with the amended GTCs, he is free to immediately discontinue the use of the free service(s). The latter shall be done by immediately terminating the use of the services in question and notification to JobCloud in writing by letter to JobCloud, Albisriederstrasse 253, 8047 Zurich or by e-mail to info@jobcloud.ch.

**12.2. OTHER CHANGES TO THESE GTCs**

JobCloud shall inform the Business Customer in writing of any amendments to these GTCs (providing the new GTCs and an overview of the relevant changes) at least four (4) weeks prior to the planned effective date of said change. The Business Customer shall be entitled to object to the amendment in writing, at least two (2) weeks prior to the planned effective date of said change. If the Business Customer does not object or fails to do so in time in writing, then the Business Customer’s consent to the amendment shall be deemed granted and the new version of the GTCs shall enter into force vis-à-vis the Business Customer as from the planned date. If the Business Customer objects in due time, JobCloud shall have the option to continue the contractual relationship with the respective Business Customer under the continued validity of the old GTC or to terminate the contractual relationship as of the date the planned amendment becomes effective.

**13\. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PARTS OF THE CONTRACT**

The integral parts of the contract are as follows (to the extent available or applicable in the specific case): (i) the written cooperation agreement concluded between JobCloud and the Business Customer, (ii) the written offer specific to Business Customers, (iii) JobCloud’s  written order confirmation, (iv) these GTCs, (v) product-related terms and conditions  (vi) the service description applicable at the time of use of a service and posted on JobCloud’s Platforms and (vii) the Data Processing Agreement. In case of ambiguities or contradictions between the individual contractual documents, the above order of precedence shall apply, except that the Data Processing Agreement shall take precedence over all other documents in each case.

Any contractual terms and conditions of the Business Customer that deviate from or conflict with the present GTCs shall be deemed null and void. Anything to the contrary shall only apply if JobCloud expressly consents in writing to the applicability of the Business Customer’s contractual terms and conditions. For the sake of clarity: Expressions such as in writing in these GTCs and the special terms and conditions do not mean the simple written form according to the Swiss Code of Obligations, but that e.g. an electronic text by e-mail or an acceptance by means of ticking a box is sufficient.

**14\. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE OF JURISDICTION**

These GTCs and any disputes arising from or in connection with these GTCs between JobCloud and the Business Customer shall be governed exclusively by Swiss law, to the exclusion of the provisions of the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law (PILA). The courts of the city of Zurich shall have exclusive jurisdiction.

**15\. SANCTIONS CLAUSE**

The Business Customer warrants that it is not subject to any economic, trade or financial sanctions or embargoes, and that it is not on any list of persons with whom business is restricted or prohibited, or it is controlled by such a person, or its shares are held by such a person. This applies in particular to measures and lists issued by the Swiss authorities, the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. government, the European Union or one or more of its member states or other competent governmental authorities.

Zurich, December 2023

Special Product-Specific Terms and Conditions
---------------------------------------------

  
**A. Special Terms and Conditions CV DATABASE**

These Special Terms and Conditions CV database apply to any Business Customer that accesses or uses the JobCloud CV database. These Special Terms and Conditions apply in addition to the General Terms and Conditions and any product or service description, or additional rules or requirements set out in other documents or on the Platform.

**1\. SERVICE**

**1.1 Scope**

JobCloud maintains a database with CVs of potential candidates. Business Customers that purchase the CV database service can view full profiles of candidates and contact candidates via the CV database once the candidates approved Business Customer’s contact request. In addition, the Business Customer can search for suitable candidates and then sort and save the search results. JobCloud may return different results for the same search query and has full discretion with respect to the CVs or profiles it presents in response to any particular search.

If candidates delete or deactivate their CV, their profile will be automatically removed from the CV database. In such a case the Business Customer will no longer be able to access the profiles or contact the corresponding candidates.  
JobCloud does not guarantee that the information provided by candidates (email address, CV, etc.) is complete, up-to-date or accurate. JobCloud does not guarantee that a message will be received, read, or acted upon by any candidate. Any filtering, sorting, matching, or ranking tools available to the Business Customer as part of the CV database service rely on the candidate-provided information and/or information Business Customer provides to JobCloud about its job requirements or preferences. The appearance of a given candidate’s CV in search results or as a match is not a guarantee that the candidate has the attributes or experience the Business Customer has selected or that they would be interested in a job.

When Business Customer uses the CV database service, JobCloud does not guarantee that Business Customer will see desirable, or any, search results in response to each query or that Business Customer will see desirable, or any, daily matches. Business Customer is solely responsible for determining or verifying any candidate provided information, including whether a candidate has a certain license, certification, or security clearance.

**1.2 Licenses / numbers of devices / access** 

The number of licenses per Business Customer is indicated in the additional contractual agreement between JobCloud and the Business Customer. The Business Customer may access the CV database a certain, contractually agreed number of times per day. JobCloud may limit the number of devices each account is logged from. The access is solely for the individual use of the person to whom it is assigned and may not be shared with other users.  JobCloud may in its sole discretion pause your access to the CV database and upon JobCloud unpausing the access, it will continue for the remaining term.

**1.3 Interaction with candidates** 

In some circumstances, JobCloud may in its own discretion limit the number and/or frequency of times the Business Customer may contact a candidate through the CV database. For example, if the Business Customer contacts a candidate, and the candidate does not express interest or contact the Business Customer back, the Business Customer may not be able to contact them again for a certain period of time. Moreover, in case JobCloud detects unusual activities (e.g., disproportionate number of requests), JobCloud may limit or disable the contact option. JobCloud also reserves the right to drop any message, including without limitation dropping any message with a link or zip attachment or any other attachment containing scripts, macros, or other code, or other messages that JobCloud suspects to be malicious or spam, or for any or no reason.

**2 THE BUSINESS CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS**

**2.1. General obligations**

The Business Customer undertakes to use the CV database exclusively in connection with JobCloud’s services and only as described on the Platforms as well as in accordance with the contractual provisions and the applicable laws, in particular the applicable data protection regulations. With regard to data protection, the Business Customer is aware that it is an independent controller of the personal data of the candidates and confirms to ensure that all data protection obligations are observed. The Business Customer confirms not to use personal data for any purposes other than recruitment and not to share any information about a candidate to any unauthorized third party and unless necessary for a specific recruitment.  The only acceptable use of the CV database service is for the Business Customer to contact a candidate through JobCloud regarding a job listing or potential employment. Therefore, requests to candidates to create an own CV database or to sell products are for example prohibited. Scraping or data mining the JobCloud CV database is prohibited.

The Business Customer shall not use the CV database for any directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, or fraudulent purpose. Under no circumstances may the CV database be used for fraud such as to e.g., scam candidates. The contact service must neither be used in a spam like manner. JobCloud defines “spam like manner” as sending requests for job positions to persons who are, as indicated by JobCloud experience and/or candidate behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role or who have indicated that such requests are unwanted. The Business Customer is solely responsible for its use of the CV database, including but not limited to, how it searches for candidates, who it decides to contact, and any employment related decisions it makes. Business Customer is expressly forbidden from using any product or system in order to circumvent the set-out procedure.

Business Customer shall access the JobCloud CV database from Switzerland or in exceptional cases from countries which provide for an adequate data protection from a Swiss law perspective.

**2.2 Specific obligations for competitors**

If a Business Customer is a competitor of JobCloud (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job posting websites) Business Customer may not use the JobCloud CV database to contact a candidate for the purpose of sending them a job offer from their clients.

**3\. INDEMNIFICATION AND TERMINATION**
