Opportunities With Expiring Domains
-----------------------------------

In case you didn’t know, there are hundreds of high quality domains expiring every day. Domains expire because individuals or businesses simply forget to renew or they decide to let the domain go. This represents a significant opportunity to purchase valuable domains at an extremely low price.

Use the Who.is tools to identify and register expiring domains and recently expired domains without spending all day doing it. You can view up to six expiring TLDs (.COM, .NET, .ORG, .INFO, .US, and .BIZ). Search a keyword phrase and filter the results by character count, include hyphens or numbers, and even view domains that have hundreds of existing backlinks – which can be extremely valuable for your efforts with search engine optimization (SEO). You would be amazed at some of the domains you could register today!

ccTLD's and gTLD's
------------------

What is a TLD? A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet (think .com, .biz, .uk etc.). Who.is offers data on a wide variety of domains including country code top-level domains ([ccTLDs](https://who.is/cctlds "ccTLD")) and generic op level domains (gTLDs). Generic TLDs are the most prevalent domain extensions such as .COM, .NET, .EDU, and .GOV just to name a few. Country code domains (ccTLDs) are domain extensions that represent different countries but can be used creatively to brand your business in a unique way.

For example, www.Who.is uses the domain extension “.IS” which is the ccTLD of Iceland. Other ccTLDs such as .TV (from the islands of Tuvalu) have become extremely popular as a way for U.S. companies to brand sites that contain largely video-based content.

What is a Domain Name Anyway?
-----------------------------

A domain name It is a unique identifier - combination of letters and/or numbers - which identifies a specific website or computer on the Internet.

There are three parts of a domain name: Top-level, second level, and third level. The top level refers to the end of the domain (such as .com) and identifies the type of organization. A second level domain is the common name identifier such as “Google” and identifies the organization’s website. The third level domain is at the beginning of the domain name (e.g. www) and identifies a particular host server.

With the wide variety of domains available, and the complexity of finding that perfect domain, make your domain search and WHOIS lookup simpler today with Who.is!
