Such Monetization Terms, in addition to these Terms, will govern your access to and use of the Monetization Services. To the extent you use Monetization Services in connection with your User Content, such User Content will be "**Monetized Content**".

You acknowledge that you may be required to have an account with our third party payment providers in order to use the Monetization Services. Your use of any such third party payment providers is subject to such provider's terms of use and privacy policy. Depending on your location, some or all of the Monetization Services may be unavailable.

**Fees and payments**

The amount of revenue earned through your use of the Monetization Services may be subject to certain fees retained by Spotify in accordance with the applicable sections of the [Fee Schedule](https://help.anchor.fm/hc/articles/360012563112-Cashing-out-from-your-wallet-) or as otherwise presented to you. Spotify reserves the right to charge you a portion of any costs of any chargeback or credit card fees or mobile platform fees that Spotify incurs in connection with its management of your Monetized Content or your usage of the Monetization Services.

Further each party shall be solely responsible for collection and remittance of all Indirect taxes it is legally obliged to collect and remit. Each party shall be solely responsible for payment of any tax assessed on its income. The Parties acknowledge that as of the Effective Date and to the best of their knowledge, there is no withholding tax applicable to payments due under this Agreement. In case the local law and /or changing in the law requires the application of withholding tax, both parties will work together to mitigate it. The parties further acknowledge that they will collect all relevant documentation needed in the event of a tax audit.

**Suspension/Termination**

Without limiting anything in the Monetization Terms or Spotify's other remedies: (a) if Spotify reasonably suspects you are misusing the Monetization Services in any way, or you otherwise fail to comply with these Terms (including the Monetization Terms), Spotify may, subject to Section 7, limit, suspend, or terminate your Account(s) and/or access to the Monetization Services, delay or remove hosted content, remove any special status associated with your Account(s), remove, not display, and/or demote listings, reduce or eliminate any discounts, withhold or prevent cashout of any funds, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent you from using the Service; and (b) if you become ineligible for the Monetization Services, Spotify may suspend or terminate your access to the Monetization Services.

### [](#warranty-and-disclaimer)Warranty and Disclaimer

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the exclusion and limitations in this section may not apply to you.

**The Service is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. Further, Spotify and all owners of the content disclaim any express, implied, and statutory warranties regarding the content, including warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Neither Spotify nor any owner of content warrants that the Service or content is free of malware or other harmful components. In addition, Spotify makes no representation regarding, nor does it warrant or assume any responsibility for, any third-party applications (or the content thereof), user content, devices or any product or service advertised, promoted or offered by a third party on or through the Service or any hyperlinked website, and Spotify is not responsible for any transactions between you and any third-party providers of the foregoing. No advice or information whether oral or in writing obtained by you from Spotify shall create any warranty on behalf of Spotify.

This section applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.**

### [](#governing-law-mandatory-arbitration-and-venue)Governing Law, Mandatory Arbitration and Venue

Governing Law and Jurisdiction

Unless otherwise required by mandatory laws in your country of residence, these Terms and any dispute, claim, and/or controversy that in any way relates to or arises in connection with these Terms or your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service ("**Dispute**") are subject to the laws of Sweden, without regard to its choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Sweden to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that arises in connection with these Terms (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them), except where under applicable mandatory laws, you can choose to bring legal proceedings in your country of residence, or we are required to only bring legal proceedings in your country of residence..

CLASS ACTION WAIVER

WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

ARBITRATION

If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this section is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:

Dispute resolution and arbitration

Subject to the section "UK" section below, you and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.

Exceptions

Notwithstanding the section above, you and Spotify both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court or (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

Arbitration rules

Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") then in force (the "ICC Rules") by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Agreements, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.

Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the relevant state or country described in clause 6.1, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.

Time for filing

Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.

Notice;Process

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("**Notice**"). Spotify's address for Notice is: Spotify, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("**Demand**"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Spotify shall pay you the greater of (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law. Except as required to enforce the arbitrator's decision and award, neither you nor Spotify shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.

Modifications

In the event that Spotify makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Spotify's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Spotify's address for Notice, in which case your account with Spotify shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.

Enforceability

If the class action waiver above is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described above shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreements and you shall not be prevented from bringing proceedings at any time.

UK

The foregoing paragraphs of the Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to consumers within the United Kingdom.

If you are located in the United Kingdom and we are unable to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy, we may also opt to resolve any such dispute, claim or controversy by mediation. Mediation will be provided by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) who will appoint a mediator.

### [](#severability-and-waiver)Severability and Waiver

Unless as otherwise stated in these Terms, should any provision of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.

Any failure by Spotify or any third-party beneficiary to enforce these Terms or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify's or the applicable third-party beneficiary's right to do so.

### [](#assignment)Assignment
