For purposes of this Agreement, the terms “you” and “your” refer to the individual user of this site or, if the user is using this site on behalf of an entity, the terms “you” and “your” include the user and that entity.

All material found at this site (including all content, visuals, audio, text, icons, displays, databases, media, products, processes, and information) is owned or licensed by us. Unless otherwise indicated, you may: 

* post material from the [Gospel Media](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media-library?lang=eng) portion of this site to another website or on a computer network for your own personal, noncommercial use; and 
* view, download, and print materials from this site for your own personal, noncommercial use (including such use in connection with your calling in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (“Church”)). In this regard, materials (besides those available in the Gospel Media) may not be posted from this site to another website or computer network without our prior written permission. 

In addition, materials from this site may be reproduced by media personnel for use in traditional public news forums unless otherwise indicated. Any other use of information or materials found at this site, including any use by organizations or legal entities, is not permitted without our prior written permission. (See “Permission to Use Copyrights and Trademarks” below.)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve sole discretion and right to deny, revoke, and limit use of this site, including the reproduction and any other use of any material available through any portion of this site. It is not our responsibility, however, to determine what “fair use” means for users wishing to use materials from this site.

Furthermore, we are not required to give additional source citations, or to guarantee that the materials of this site are cleared for any alternate use. Such responsibility also ultimately remains with individual users of this site.

### **Linking**

For your convenience, this site may contain links to websites operated by others. Such third-party websites are not maintained or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for their content. Although we have made a good-faith effort to link only to tasteful and appropriate websites, some may contain inappropriate or objectionable material. If you find such material while using a website that you accessed through a link on this site, please notify us immediately.

We do not control, endorse, or adopt any third-party content and we have no responsibility for the same, including, without limitation, material that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable. You must evaluate and bear all risks associated with third-party content.

We believe that those who make information available on the Internet expect that it will be publicly and widely available. Therefore, we believe that linking to other websites is legally permissible and consistent with the expectations of those who use the Internet. However, if access to a particular website should be restricted, the operator of such website should promptly notify us.
