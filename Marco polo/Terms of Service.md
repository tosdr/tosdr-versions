You also must ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times.

Your Account is associated with the Account Phone Number you provide to us when you register. **If you subsequently change your phone number, you must notify us and provide us your new phone number before you relinquish the phone number associated with your Account in order to update your Account Phone Number. If you fail to update or notify us before you relinquish or change your phone number, you may not be able to access data in your Account and your Account may be terminated according to Section 2.e., below.** You may update or change your Account Phone Number [here](https://marcopolo.me/static/change-number/change-by-email.html) or get help by contacting us at [support@marcopolo.me](mailto:support@marcopolo.me).

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and for restricting access to your computers and mobile devices, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur in your Account. You may be liable for the losses incurred by us or others due to any unauthorized use of your Account.

Notwithstanding your and Joya Communications Inc.'s agreement that California law governs interpretation and application of these Terms generally, you and Joya Communications Inc. further hereby agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. ("FAA"), applies to this agreement to arbitrate, and governs all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.

Unless you and Joya Communications Inc. agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS"), pursuant to JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Streamlined Rules"), as modified by this agreement, and consistent with JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness ("JAMS Consumer Fairness Standards"). The arbitrator must honor the terms and limitations in the agreement and can award damages and relief, including any attorneys' fees authorized by law. **YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND JOYA COMMUNICATIONS INC. ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.**

Notwithstanding JAMS Streamlined Rule 8(b), you and Joya Communications Inc. agree that any dispute as to the arbitrability of a claim brought by either you or Joya Communications Inc. shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction.

**THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW CLASS ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE PROCEDURES OR RULES OF JAMS WOULD. RATHER, YOU AND JOYA COMMUNICATIONS INC. ARE ONLY ENTITLED TO PURSUE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. FURTHER, AND UNLESS YOU AND JOYA COMMUNICATIONS INC. AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL PARTY'S CLAIMS WITH ANY OTHER PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING.**

**The Arbitrator's Decision**

The arbitrator will render an award in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Joya Communications Inc. will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Joya Communications Inc. may have under applicable law to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if Joya Communications Inc. prevails in arbitration, unless you assert a frivolous claim.

The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

**Location & Fees**

Unless you and Joya Communications Inc. agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration will take place in-person in the county in which you reside.

If you initiate an arbitration for claims arising from this agreement, you will be required to pay $250 of the fee required to initiate the arbitration and Joya Communications Inc. will pay any remaining JAMS Case Management Fees and all professional fees for the arbitrator's services; you will remain responsible for your respective costs relating to counsel, experts, witnesses, and travel to the arbitration.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of such court's jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Joya Communications Inc. on your behalf.

**Changes**

Notwithstanding the provisions regarding modification of these Terms, if Joya Communications Inc. changes this "Mandatory, Bilateral Arbitration" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Joya Communications Inc. written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: 2443 Fillmore St #380-5790, San Francisco, CA 94115, or by email from the email address associated with your Account to: [terms@marcopolo.me](mailto:terms@marcopolo.me?Subject=Terms) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated by the effective date below.
