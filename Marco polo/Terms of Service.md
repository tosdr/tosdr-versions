You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and for restricting access to your computers and mobile devices, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur in your Account.

Â§ 1, et seq. ("FAA"), applies to this agreement to arbitrate, and governs all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.

Unless you and Joya Communications Inc. agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS"), pursuant to JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Streamlined Rules"), as modified by this agreement, and consistent with JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness ("JAMS Consumer Fairness Standards"). The arbitrator must honor the terms and limitations in the agreement and can award damages and relief, including any attorneys' fees authorized by law. **YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND JOYA COMMUNICATIONS INC.

**The Arbitrator's Decision**

The arbitrator will render an award in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Joya Communications Inc. will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Joya Communications Inc. may have under applicable law to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if Joya Communications Inc. prevails in arbitration, unless you assert a frivolous claim.

The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

**Location & Fees**

Unless you and Joya Communications Inc. agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration will take place in-person in the county in which you reside.

If you initiate an arbitration for claims arising from this agreement, you will be required to pay $250 of the fee required to initiate the arbitration and Joya Communications Inc. will pay any remaining JAMS Case Management Fees and all professional fees for the arbitrator's services; you will remain responsible for your respective costs relating to counsel, experts, witnesses, and travel to the arbitration.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of such court's jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Joya Communications Inc. on your behalf.
