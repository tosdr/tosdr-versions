Cookies Policy
==============

_(updated May 24th, 2018; effective May 25, 2018)_

### Introduction

This „Cookie Policy” applies to all visitors of autoevolution ([https://www.autoevolution.com](https://www.autoevolution.com/) and subdomains), an Internet web site owned and operated by SoftNews Net SRL, a company based in Bucharest, Romania, hereinafter referred to as the “Website”.

The information presented herein is meant to advise visitors and registered users of autoevolution on the usage of “cookies” by SoftNews Net SRL in regard to this “Website” and the services offered within.

### Definition

“Cookie” is a term used to refer to cookie modules and similar technologies through which information can be collected and stored.

An “Internet Cookie” (also known as “browser cookie” or simply “cookie”) is a small text file that contains alphanumerical data and is stored in the memory of computers, smartphones and other Internet-enabled devices. A cookie has two components: the name and the content.

Cookies are installed (set) through instructions sent by a web server to a web browser (the application used to access a web site, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) or by using a client-side scripting language (such as Javascript). Cookies are “passive” by nature, meaning they cannot contain software applications, cannot contain malware and cannot themselves access information from the device they are stored on.

By design, cookies can only be accessed by the same web site that installed them, whenever the user returns to that web site.

### Cookie usage purposes

Cookies are used to improve the user experience of the Website, adapt some features to the preferences of each user, and ensure a smooth operation of the Website services. Specifically:

* Registering a user account
* Saving user preferences
* Anonymous web traffic statistics to the Website (this allows us to see how we are doing and which areas of the Website can be improved)
* Delivery of online advertisements (since all Website services are free, this is how we are able to stay in business)

### Cookie lifetime

Cookie lifetime can vary depending on their purpose. Based on lifetime, cookies fall in one of two categories:

* Session cookies: stored temporary, deleted automatically when the web browser is closed
* Persistent cookies: stored on the user’s device until a specific time (which can be minutes, days, or years in the future) or until deleted manually through web browser settings or specialized computer software

### Third-party cookies

Some parts of the content shown on the Website can come from external sources, which can add their own cookies, called “third-party cookies”. Specifically:

* **YouTube:** embedded videos (using _youtube-nocookie_ for improved privacy) - [privacy policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7671399?hl=en)
* **Vimeo:** embeded videos - [privacy policy](https://vimeo.com/privacy)
* **Twitter:** embedded tweets - [privacy policy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy)

* **Google Analytics:** anonymous web traffic statistics (we use the following settings: **anonymizeIP ON, Remarketing OFF, User-ID OFF**) - [details](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en) / [settings / opt-out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)
* **Google Adsense/Doubleclick/AdManager:** online advertisements - [settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads)
* **Sovrn:** online advertisements - [policy for EU users](https://www.sovrn.com/privacy-policy-eu/) - [opt-out](http://info.evidon.com/pub_info/2672?v=1&nt=0&nw=false)
* **Connatix:** online advertisements (video) - [privacy policy](https://www.connatix.com/privacy-policy/)
* **VideoIntelligence:** online advertisements (video) - [privacy policy](https://www.vi.ai/legal/privacy-policy/)
* **Anyclip:** online advertisements (video) - [privacy policy](https://anyclip.com/privacy-policy/)

### Types of cookies used on the Website

**Strictly necessary cookies:** used to enable core web site functionality and store user preferences  
**Performance cookies:** used to facilitate usage statistics, including web traffic statistics  
**Authentication cookies:** used to allow registration of accounts as well as authentication (log in) to those accounts  
**Advertising cookies:** used to allow statistics on the performance of advertisemens as well as target advertisements based on user interests

### First-party cookies list

**aelastts:** stores the timestamp of your last visit, so we know which stories to show in the "new articles" list  
**aeccunit:** stores the measurement unit preference for data display (metric system or U.S.)  
**cbs:**: stores the sorting preference for car/moto model lists  
**ulprod:** a BASE64-encoded representation of your Newspaper, if you have one configured - [details here](https://www.autoevolution.com/newspaper/customize/)

### Third-party cookies

**\_ga:** Google Analytics, used to count sessions and unique users in web traffic statistics - [details](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage?hl=en)

**\_gat:** Google Analytics, used to throttle requests to the statistics server  
**\_\_gads/\_\_gac:** Google Adsense rate-limiting & performance - [details](https://policies.google.com/technologies/types)

### Cookie management information

Disabling cookies makes the Website harder to use. Some features will be degraded while others will not work at all. For example, it is impossible to register or log in without cookies. This way, using the download basket or the watchlist features is no longer possible.

Nevertheless, users can configure their web browser to reject (or accept) cookies sent by specific sites. All modern browsers offer this functionality, which can be accessed through the “options” or “preferences” menu.

Disabling cookies will not stop advertisements from being show, but it might make them less relevant to users’ interests.
