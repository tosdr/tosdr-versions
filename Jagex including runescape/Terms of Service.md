Terms & Conditions
==================

Version 0.8

Date: May 2024

### 1\. Introduction

These terms and conditions of use, together with our [privacy policy](https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/terms/privacy), [Game Rules](https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/terms/rules-of-runescape), [end-user licence agreements for authorised software](https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/terms/eula) ("EULA") and all supplemental terms (as amended from time to time), other documents and policies that are expressly referenced in these terms and conditions (the "Terms"), govern your use of any Jagex Products (as defined below) made available by Jagex to you ("you"/"yours").

The Jagex Product (as defined) is made available to you in accordance with these Terms by Jagex Limited ("Jagex", “we”, “our”, “us”), a company registered in England and Wales (registered number 3982706), and whose registered office is at 220 Science Park, Cambridge, CB4 0WA, United Kingdom. Our VAT number is 791 951 784.

Please read these Terms carefully. These Terms form a legally binding contract between you and us. By downloading, browsing, installing, accessing or using a Jagex Product in any way, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms you should not create an account (“Account”) in relation to the Jagex Product or download, install, browse, use or access the Jagex Product. If you have created an Account or used or downloaded a Jagex Product, but do not agree to these Terms, you should immediately discontinue your use of the Jagex Product, cancel your Account and uninstall it from your device.

To use the Jagex Product you may be required to comply with third-party platform operator terms (e.g. Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store terms). If you are accessing any Jagex Product via any third-party platform then these Terms shall apply in respect of your use of the Jagex Product, in addition to any terms and conditions imposed by such third party platform.

PLEASE KEEP A COPY OF THESE TERMS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. YOU SHOULD CHECK THESE TERMS EVERY TIME YOU USE A JAGEX PRODUCT AS WE MAY CHANGE THESE TERMS AT ANY TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCESS SET OUT AT SECTION 3 BELOW.

### 2\. Definitions

**"Jagex Product(s)"** means the applicable mobile and online PC platform versions of the games 'RuneScape' (also known as 'RuneScape 3' or 'RS3') and 'Old School RuneScape' (also known as 'OSRS') and such other games and platform versions as Jagex may make available to you from time to time (whether existing now or in the future) pursuant to these Terms and which shall include any authorised software needed to operate these games and access the platforms, all updates, additional content and localised versions thereof and any other related products, websites, applications or services made available by Jagex). THE ONGOING SUPPLY OF ANY PARTICULAR JAGEX PRODUCT IS NOT GUARANTEED. SOME JAGEX PRODUCTS HAVE AGE RESTRICTIONS.

References to **"Stopping"** or to **"Stop"** an Account includes temporarily or permanently disabling, suspending, banning or muting an Account. If your Account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat. If your Account is disabled or banned, you will not be able to access your Account and any licenses previously granted to you to use the Jagex Products will be either temporarily or permanently revoked. THIS MEANS YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, CHARACTERS AND ANY IN-GAME ITEMS OR CURRENCY. SUBSCRIPTION CREDIT CONTINUES TO EXPIRE IF ACCOUNTS ARE STOPPED. More information about when Jagex may Stop your Account can be found in section 11 of these Terms.

**"Subscriber"** is used to describe a user of a Jagex Product who pays a fee to obtain enhanced features of that Jagex Product. More information about subscriptions can be found in section 12 of these Terms.

**"User Content"** means all information of any kind (including remarks, suggestions, ideas, graphics, text, images, video, information and messages) communicated, posted, uploaded, or sent by users (whether Subscribers or free players) on or in connection with Jagex Products (including any user content created in game such as the particular appearance of a character). Jagex Products may include social elements which permit players to come into contact with and chat to other players. Messages exchanged between players, whether in private in-game messaging or public forums, are included within this definition of User Content.

**"Virtual Currencies"** is used to describe the in-game currencies that can be purchased in certain Jagex Products. More information can be found in section 13 of these Terms.

Other terms are defined in context below.

### 3\. Changes to these Terms

We may change these Terms to reflect: (a) changes in applicable laws; (b) regulatory or security requirements; (c) relevant guidance or codes of practice; (d) technical alterations to Jagex Products; (e) to improve clarity and consistency; or (f) for any other reason within the sole discretion of Jagex.

Please check the Terms whenever you use a Jagex Product. We will treat your continued use of a Jagex Product as acceptance of any changes made to the Terms from the previous version. If you do not agree with the changes you should cancel your Account and if applicable subscription before the renewal date.

### 4\. Preteens and users under 18

Jagex Products have age restrictions which prevent users who are under 13 years of age from creating an Account. You may not create an Account or use the Jagex Product if you are under the age of 13 and it is a violation of our Terms to register an Account on behalf of someone under this age. Where an applicable age rating body (e.g PEGI, ESRB, USK) or platform (e.g Apple, Google Play) classifies a particular Jagex Product as suitable to be played only by users of a specified age above 13 years old, then in such circumstances, users (even if Account holders) below this classified age shall not be entitled to play, use or access the particular Jagex Product until they have reached the specified age classification. In all other circumstances, for users between 13 and 18 years of age, subject to the exceptions set out above and the laws of your country of residence (including the applicable age rating classification allocated to the Jagex Product by the relevant age rating authority and/or platform) and you obtaining your parents’/guardians’ prior consent, you will be entitled to use the Jagex Products. We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we find out that any personally identifiable information we have collected is from someone under 13, we will Stop the Account.

If you are under 18, by using the Jagex Product you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents/guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our Terms. We may Stop any Account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given. You and your parent(s) or guardian(s) must review these Terms together. Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of children under 18 years of age when using the Jagex Products. We recommend that parents and guardians familiarize themselves with parental controls on devices they provide their child.

If we are told by a parent/guardian that their child has misrepresented their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the Account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian of that child.

Parents can find more information about Jagex Products and how to contact us in the [Parents' Guide](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206747519-Parent-s-Guide)

### 5\. Safety and abuse

Before using any Jagex Product you should read the [safety information](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/sections/4487923537041). Parents of those users under the age of 18 should also review this information.

You should be aware of the potential risks of using a service which includes extensive User Content. User Content may be inaccurate, out of date or otherwise inappropriate. We cannot guarantee that users will comply with our Terms, rules or otherwise behave appropriately. You should not assume that a person is who he or she claims to be. In your own interests, you should not attempt to contact any user outside a Jagex Product.

If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you should report such inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game "Report abuse" button as well as seeking appropriate external help, for example from parents or law enforcement authorities. If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied, then you must stop using the relevant Jagex Products. Alternatively, please contact our [customer support team](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/sections/360000236977-Contact-Us-).

Anti-Cheat Technologies

We may use anti-cheat technologies in relation to the Jagex Products. When you connect online to a game server, these technologies may activate and monitor your game play, the files on your computer associated with the Jagex Product or that otherwise access our servers, and your computer's memory, purely for the purposes of detecting and preventing cheating.

If any of these anti-cheat technologies detect cheating, we may collect relevant information necessary for our investigation and enforcement purposes, including your Account name, details about the unauthorized third party program and the Jagex Product files modification detected, and the time and date it was detected. We also may terminate these Terms, your access to the Jagex Products, and your Jagex Account if we determine you have been cheating.

Chat Monitors

We have automated systems that monitor chat for certain keywords and provide us with a selection of high-risk User Content to review. Further we use manual and automated processes to review any chat that contains phrases supplied to us by the Internet Watch Foundation or relate to child protection issues or where a user indicates in chat that they are under 13 years old.

In addition, our staff can enact a duty of care and review chat logs if we have a reasonable belief that a user may be contemplating suicide or harming other users or third parties. We may also access and search chat logs to identify and action illegal content. Illegal content includes (this is not a definitive list) harassment, threats, discrimination, intimate image abuse, sexual exploitation, terrorism, coercive behaviour and encouraging suicide. We may supply chat logs to relevant civil and criminal authorities in line with our Privacy Policy.

### 6\. Your account and license

To use many features of Jagex Products, we require you to create an Account and, in relation to some platform versions of Jagex Products, download and/or, install certain authorised software on your device. You may be required to create an Account before downloading and installing any software. We grant valid Account holders a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, personal, limited license, which can be revoked at any time, to access and use the Jagex Products and (as applicable) to download and use our software and install the Jagex Products on a device and to connect to our servers solely to use Jagex Products for personal and non-commercial purposes and subject at all times to your strict compliance with these Terms. To be clear, we consider the creation of an Account in order to access any authorised software in order to understand, decompile, reverse engineer, copy, reproduce, or transmit such authorised software as being outside the scope of “personal and non-commercial use”. We reserve all other rights, including all right, title and interest in the Jagex Products and associated intellectual property rights. You may not otherwise use, decompile, reverse engineer, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly perform, distribute, commercially exploit, adapt, translate, modify, bundle, merge, share or make available to any person, or create derivative works of the Jagex Product. Further you may not use any automation tools, macros, bots, auto-typers and tools to circumvent any technical mechanisms or protections in place, share, sell or buy any other Accounts, or participate in any way whatsoever in any real-world trading, use multiple Accounts to break any of these Terms, exploit any known faults or bugs in the Jagex Products or authorised software, impersonate any employee, officer or agent of Jagex, persuade or attempt to persuade (including procuring others to persuade) other users to share any Account information, run or attempt to run any types of games of chance whether in the Jagex Product or in the real world using any part of the Jagex Product (including any Virtual Currencies); encourage others whether directly or indirectly to break any of these Terms; use inappropriate language or behaviour including any action that may be considered offensive, racist, obscene, discriminatory; nor ask for any personal details of other users; advertise other websites in the Jagex Product or any Jagex authorised forums or social media platforms.

Except as provided in these Terms, use of the Jagex Product does not grant you any right, title, interest or license to any such intellectual property you may access through the Jagex Products. Except as provided in these Terms, any use or reproduction of the Jagex Products or intellectual property therein is strictly prohibited.

THE JAGEX PRODUCTS AND ANY ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE ARE LICENSED TO YOU, NOT SOLD. YOUR LICENSE CONFERS NO TITLE OR OWNERSHIP TO THE JAGEX PRODUCTS OR SOFTWARE.

When setting up an Account for a Jagex Product, you may be asked to choose a username that will be used to identify you to other users. For example, a Jagex Product character name. You must not choose a username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff or other users, which is deliberately confusing, offensive, racist, obscene, hurtful, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate or which breaches the username requirements specified in the applicable rules relating to the Jagex Product. We reserve the right (at our sole and absolute discretion), to change any username for any reason or take such other action as we believe appropriate.

You agree to keep your password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person. You are fully responsible for all activities on your Account (including the activities of all persons who use your password to gain access to your Account or who use the device on which the Jagex Product or related software is installed and/or downloaded) and for complying with any licences granted in these Terms and for any software. You are expressly prohibited from allowing anyone else to use your Account or to play or access the Jagex Product on your behalf. We reserve the right to Stop immediately your Account if someone else uses it. To help ensure the safety of your password, you must keep your computer and/or device (as applicable) free of viruses and other malicious code including Trojans, worms, time bombs, malware and spyware. You must use your password in accordance with the password requirements specified in the rules of the Jagex Product. REAL JAGEX STAFF WILL NEVER ASK YOU FOR YOUR PASSWORD.

We do not guarantee Jagex Products will be secure or free from bugs or viruses.

You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Jagex Product, the server on which the Jagex Product is stored, or any server, computer or database connected to the Jagex Product. You must not attack the Jagex Products via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of service attack. By breaching this provision, you would commit a criminal offence under the Computer Misuse Act (1990). We will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities, and we will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In the event of such a breach, your right to use and licenses granted in these Terms to the Jagex Product will cease immediately without notice from us.

If you believe that someone has stolen your password or you believe you have lost or had stolen the device upon which the Jagex Product or related software is installed or accessible or you believe that someone other than you has gained access to your Account, you should immediately submit an Account recovery request via the Jagex Product’s main menu. You will remain responsible for your Account until you have notified us.

2. there has been fraudulent, unlawful or abusive activity; and/or

We reserve the right to alter the amount or Terms of our subscription fees at any time. This will only apply to Subscribers, who, following the change, take out new subscriptions or re-subscribe (their previous subscriptions having expired) and specifically agree to the new fees/terms in accordance with these Terms. For existing Subscribers who subscribed prior to the change in the subscription fee amounts and/or terms being implemented, then provided the existing Subscriber’s subscription has not expired or terminated or the nature and type of their subscription has not altered, such Subscribers will not be bound by such subsequent changes.

We reserve the right to charge you for any unauthorized use of your subscription by third parties.

Cancelling your subscription

You may cancel your subscription at any time by clicking the link [here](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206853909-Cancel-Subscription) or visiting the Account management section on the menu screen of the Jagex Product.

No payments already made in respect of subscriptions (including advance subscription payments made with periods remaining unused) or virtual currencies or items will be refunded (wholly or partly) but you can of course use up any unused subscription credit in the Account.

### 13\. Virtual Currencies, micro-game credits and virtual items

In certain Jagex Products, you may be given the opportunity to purchase a license (or in our sole discretion, acquire a license as a free promotion) of: (i) Virtual Currencies, and/or (ii) credits that can be redeemed to play micro-games ( **"Micro-Game Credits"**). Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits can be redeemed (i.e. used) to acquire certain digital goods/services in the Jagex Product, which we describe below as **"Items"**. If you obtain a license to use such Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits from Jagex, you must check that they have been correctly credited to your Account and tell us immediately if not. If you confirm you wish to purchase or acquire a license to such Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits (as applicable), we will only be legally bound to provide you with such a license of the Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits (as applicable) if we (or our third party operators) subsequently notify you of our acceptance in response to your confirmation and only once the Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits are made available as part of the Jagex Product.

You agree that when you obtain your Virtual Currencies and/or Micro-Game Credits from us or our authorized partners, you receive a personal, limited, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and select the rights and entitlements that Jagex expressly makes available to you associated with such Virtual Currencies and/or Micros-Game Credits and only in respect of the applicable Jagex Product. The Virtual Currencies and/or Micro-Game Credits are licensed to you and not sold. Any license granted is subject to your strict compliance with these Terms.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT VIRTUAL CURRENCIES AND MICRO-GAME CREDITS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING VERY IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits may expire if they have not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition, so you should redeem these as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits or, if we haven't specified a time limit, twelve months from acquisition.

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits can only be redeemed within the world of the relevant Jagex Product where you acquired them. Each Jagex Product may contain one or more Virtual Currencies or Micro-Game Credits and unless otherwise stated, each Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit is independent and is not exchangeable for any other Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit in the same Jagex Product. WE MAY AT ANY TIME IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION CHANGE OR REMOVE ANY ITEM WHICH CAN BE ACQUIRED USING VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR MICRO-GAME CREDITS, AS WELL AS CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR MICRO-GAME CREDITS NEEDED TO ACQUIRE A PARTICULAR ITEM. You may only redeem Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits for Items on offer at the time of redemption.

Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits do not have any inherent monetary value and are not your own private property. When you purchase or acquire the license to use Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, you do not own the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits. Instead they constitute an element of your license in the relevant Jagex Product. Similarly, any Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored monetary value in any real-world currency.

We do not provide any cash or refunds for Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or Items (except as required by law) and Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items do not have any real-world monetary value. Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits are for your personal use only and as part of your Account with the relevant Jagex Product. You must not sell or transfer, trade, or exchange them (whether by itself or by transferring your Account) or make them available to anyone else or attempt to do so, or encourage anyone else to do any of these things. Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items can never be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other item of monetary value, and cannot be inherited. We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items. For example, we may cap the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits which can be acquired, held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence. CERTAIN ITEMS MAY ALSO ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO SUBSCRIBERS.

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND MICRO-GAME CREDITS HAVE NO CASH VALUE, DO NOT ACCRUE INTEREST AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW, ARE NOT REDEEMABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR ANY SUM OF MONEY OR MONETARY VALUE FROM JAGEX AT ANY TIME.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits: (1) if you have misused the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits; (2) if you have breached or may breach any of these Terms; (3) if the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits were awarded in error; (4) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed; or (5) if you have used Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to or delete Items: (1) if you have misused the Items; (2) if you have breached or may breach any of these Terms; (3) if the Items were purchased using Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits awarded in error; or (4) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits used to purchase the Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. In addition, Items that have been acquired by the redemption of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition. In addition, Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of a Jagex Product.

WE MAY AT ANY TIME DECIDE TO END IN PART OR ITS ENTIRETY THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR MICRO-GAME CREDITS PROGRAM FOR ALL OR ANY OF OUR JAGEX PRODUCTS. BEFORE WE DELETE THE UNUSED VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR MICRO-GAME CREDITS, WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO CONTACT YOU TO GIVE A REASONABLE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH TO REDEEM THEM.

Jagex Product Bonds

Where applicable, within certain Jagex Products, users may be entitled to purchase from us, a bond (“**Jagex Product Bonds**”). These Jagex Product Bonds can be used to redeem or trade against certain other Virtual Currencies, Micro-Game Credits, subscriptions Items, any promotion Items run by Jagex, and any other particular virtual product or service in the relevant Jagex Product (these collectively as " **Redemption Items**"). All Jagex Product Bonds are redeemable or tradeable in the relevant Jagex Product and cannot be redeemed or traded across different Jagex Products. For example, in relation to the Jagex Product Old School RuneScape, users can purchase an Old School Jagex Product Bond from Jagex. Old School Jagex Product Bonds are tradeable only within Old School RuneScape and RuneScape Jagex Product Bonds are tradeable only within RuneScape. Old School Jagex Product Bonds cannot be transferred to RuneScape to use for RuneCoins or Keys, nor can RuneScape Jagex Product Bonds be transferred to Old School RuneScape.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT JAGEX PRODUCT BONDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING VERY IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:

Jagex Product Bonds can only be traded and redeemed within the Jagex Product to which they relate.

WE MAY AT ANY TIME CHANGE OR REMOVE ANY REDEMPTION ITEMS WHICH CAN BE PURCHASED USING A JAGEX PRODUCT BOND, AS WELL AS CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF THE JAGEX PRODUCT BOND NEEDED TO ACQUIRE A PARTICULAR REDEMPTION ITEM. You may only redeem the Jagex Product Bond for Redemption Items on offer at the time of redemption.

Jagex Product Bonds: (i) do not have any real-world monetary value; (ii) cannot be redeemed for real world money and cannot be inherited; and (iii) are not your own private property. A Jagex Product Bond constitutes an element of your license in a Jagex Product.

WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY CASH OR REFUNDS FOR JAGEX PRODUCT BONDS (EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW). WE MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION CONCERNING THE ACQUISITION OR REDEMPTION OF JAGEX PRODUCT BONDS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY CAP THE AMOUNT OF JAGEX PRODUCT BONDS WHICH CAN BE ACQUIRED, HELD OR REDEEMED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD OR WE MAY IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS BASED ON YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE OR WE MAY IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS FOR OTHER REASONS WE DEEM NECESSARY.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate Jagex Product Bonds: (1) if you have misused the Jagex Product Bond; (2) if you have breached or may breach any of these Terms; (3) if the Jagex Product Bond was awarded in error; (4) if a payment for a Jagex Product Bond is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed; or (5) if you have used Jagex Product Bonds to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to or delete Redemption Items: (1) if you have misused the Redemption Items; (2) if you have breached or may breach any of these Terms; (3) if the Redemption Items were purchased using Jagex Product Bonds awarded in error; or (4) if a payment for Jagex Product Bonds used to purchase Redemption Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. In addition, Redemption Items that have been acquired by the redemption of Jagex Product Bonds may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition.

Redemption Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of the relevant Jagex Product.

WE MAY AT ANY TIME DECIDE TO END PART OF OR THE ENTIRETY OF THE JAGEX PRODUCT BOND PROGRAM. BEFORE WE DELETE ANY UNUSED JAGEX PRODUCT BOND, WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO CONTACT YOU TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH TO REDEEM IT.

IF YOUR ACCOUNT FOR A JAGEX PRODUCT REMAINS DORMANT (I.E. IS NOT USED) FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS, AND THERE IS UNREDEEMED VIRTUAL CURRENCY, MICRO-GAME CREDITS OR JAGEX PRODUCT BONDS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT, WE MAY CHOOSE TO CREDIT YOUR ACCOUNT WITH ITEMS OF EQUIVALENT VALUE FOR THIS EXPIRED VIRTUAL CURRENCY, MICRO-GAME CREDITS OR JAGEX PRODUCT BONDS. WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO CONTACT YOU BY EMAIL PRIOR TO SUCH ACTION BEING TAKEN.

You agree that Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Jagex Product Bonds cannot be sold or transferred (including selling or transferring the relevant Account) and cannot be exchanged for cash or any other goods and services, except for virtual items provided for within the appropriate Jagex Product.

You agree that we are not responsible for and provide no guarantee relating to the necessary use or registration of any lost Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or Jagex Product Bonds, whether they are deleted by you, or lost through any virus, bug, glitch, or similar error.

In such circumstance, Jagex shall use its reasonable endeavour to ensure all users are notified in advance and given a reasonable opportunity to download and install Jagex authorised client software.
