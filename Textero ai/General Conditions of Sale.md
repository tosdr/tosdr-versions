Cancellation of Subscription



We understand that sometimes our customers may wish to cancel their subscription and

request a refund. Therefore, we offer the following refund policy:



a. If you cancel your monthly subscription within the first 7 days of your initial purchase,

you are eligible for a full refund.



b. If you cancel your monthly subscription after the first 7 days, we will not provide a

refund for the current month's subscription fee, but you will not be charged for any

subsequent months.



c. If you have any issues or concerns with our service, please contact us at

marketing@textero.ai so we can work to resolve the issue before you decide to cancel

your subscription.



Please note, that any refund may only be done to the same account, from which the

payment has been made.
