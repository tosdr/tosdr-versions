a. Amendment; No Waiver. Crystal Project may update and change any part or all of this Agreement, including fees. If Crystal Project updates or changes this Agreement, the updated Agreement will be posted at http://www.crystalknows.com/tos. The updated Agreement will become effective and binding on the next business day after it is posted. Crystal Project encourages Customer to review this Agreement periodically. No delay in exercising any right or remedy will operate as a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy. A waiver on one occasion will not be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Crystal Project will comply with all applicable laws and regulations to the extent that any change or update to this Agreement changes or updates the manner in which Crystal Project will collect, use, process, share, or store Personal Data.

b. Applicable Law. To the maximum extent permitted by law, this Agreement and all Order Form(s) shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A. without reference to conflicts of law principles, and both parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A. in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Subscription Service. Use of the Subscription Service is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation this paragraph.

c. Severability. If any part of this Agreement or an Order Form is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including without limitation the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in effect.

d. Notices. Notice shall be sent to the contact address set forth herein (as such may be changed by notice given to the other party), and shall be deemed delivered as of the date of actual receipt.

Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, this Agreement (including each Order Form), along with any Crystal Project exhibit or addendum hereto, including any Order Form, constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Crystal Project with respect to the Subscription Service and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, proposals and agreements, whether electronic, oral or written, between Customer and Crystal Project with respect to the subject of this Agreement.

f. Assignment. Customer will not assign or transfer this Agreement, including any assignment or transfer by reason of merger, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of its assets, change of control or operation of law, without Crystal Project’s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.

g. Contract for Services. The parties intend this Agreement to be a contract for the provision of services and not a contract for the sale of goods. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA), or any substantially similar legislation as may be enacted, shall not apply to this Agreement. If Customer is located outside of the territory of the United States, the parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not govern this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement.
