### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files downloaded to your device by websites you visit. They do not run any programs and are uniquely assigned to you. Cookies are used to allow us to serve you with the most relevant content. Information collected includes, but is not limited to: geographic location, website activity, device recognition and Online Banking login activity. Cookies also allow you to save your password and preference settings you have created.

### What types of cookies are there?

**First Party** â Installed on your device by WSECU while you are on the website. Used to personalize your experience.  
**Third Party** â Installed on your device by another organization while on the WSECU website. An example is a cookie installed by an analytics program that WSECU uses to count visitors to the website.  
**Session** â Expire at the end of your browser session. For example, a session cookie allows you progress through a form without losing information you entered on a previous screen.  
**Persistent** â Stored more permanently on your hard drive. Will be recognized when you return to the website that installed them. For example, if you select âRemember Meâ when signing in, a persistent cookie will remember your device so you donât need to be sent an authentication code each time you sign in.

### Why does WSECU use cookies?

We use cookies to provide the best experience possible to each visitor to wsecu.org. Cookies allow us to serve up relevant content as well as monitor aggregated anonymous site data. We use this information to identify opportunities for improving user-experience. Cookies also allow you to save your login credentials so they do not need to be entered each time you sign in to Online Banking.

### How can I disable cookies?

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can typically change your browser settings to reject some or all cookies. However, please be aware that disabling cookies may have an impact on the functionality of wsecu.org. We cannot save your settings or remember your device if cookies are disabled and the content you see on the website will not be optimal. This also means you will receive our cookie notice each time you visit our site because a cookie allows the website to know that you have accepted the Cookie Policy. Also note that disabling cookies only prevents new cookies. To clear cookies that are already installed, you must clear your cookies. The instructions for managing cookies can typically be found in the browserâs Help or Settings section.
