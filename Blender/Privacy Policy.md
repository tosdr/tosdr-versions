### A promise!

Blender Foundation is committed to protect your privacy on blender.org. No third party will track you here. You will not find third-party advertisements on any blender.org website.

Blender has partnered with a three affiliate websites to also use the Blender ID, specifically: blenderartists.org, blender.community and blender.chat. For each external website, you will have to authorize sharing your registration individually. You can manage or revoke this by logging on on blender.org/id.

All of data we gather for these services are only used for proper handling of the services.
