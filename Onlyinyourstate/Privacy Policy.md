We will use the information you provide to fulfill your requests, including (if applicable) sending them a text message, and we will not send marketing communications to your contacts unless they have a separate relationship with us and have affirmatively consented to receive such communications. Such functionality is implemented in all jurisdictions where legally permissible. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in jurisdictions where it is legally permissible and that you have your contacts’ consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request.

**Public Data You Post Through the Services.** If you post information on your user profile or other public areas of the Services, such as reviews, comments, and user content, that information may be collected and used by us, other users of the Services, and the public generally.

You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Services that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.

**3\. Information We Automatically Collect from Your Device or Browser**

In addition to the information you provide to us, where legally permitted the Services automatically collect and process information from your device or browser. This information includes your:

* **Device Registration Data**: this may include the type of mobile device you use; your mobile device’s advertising ID (a unique user ID assigned to your mobile device or operating environment, and stored directly on the device itself, to help advertising services personalize their offers.

Please refer to our [**Cookie Notice**](https://www.worldofgoodbrands.com/cookie_notice) for more information on data collected through cookies and other tracking technologies.

6\. **Advertising and Analytics**

6.1. **Advertising and Third-Party Content and Links**

The Services are supported through advertising. From time to time we work with third-party companies, advertisers and advertising networks, to enable them to collect certain information regarding how you engage with our websites and to provide advertising through the Services.

We may allow third-party companies, including advertisers, ad networks, and advertising services providers, to serve advertisements, provide other advertising services, or collect personal information when you visit the Services. We provide these companies with the ability to collect personal information about how you interact with the Services and, if applicable, your mobile device.

This personal information includes the unique device or advertising ID associated with your device and imprecise location information (only the country, state and, on some of our websites, the city where you connect from), in order to help analyze and serve targeted advertising on the Services and elsewhere (including third-party sites and applications).

In addition, we share with these third-party providers personal information that is pseudonymized (information that only identifies you indirectly), which may consist of the following data:

* a hashed version of information that we collect from you directly (such as an email or a phone number)
* a third party IDs, such as a mobile advertising ID, a device identifier or other proprietary ID assigned by third parties)
* an IP address
* the clickstream information generated by your browser, such as HTTP header fields, browser type, time and date stamps), or operating system
* statistical identifiers calculated from data shared by your browser or device

These ads are called “matched ads”. This is generally done by us uploading a customer list to a technology service or incorporating a pixel from a technology service on our Services, and the technology service matching common factors between our data and their data. For instance, we incorporate the Facebook pixel on our Services and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences.

Similarly, these advertisers share personal information with us about you that they have independently gathered or acquired. We also share the personal information we have collected in order to enable our advertising partners to perform data analysis or for advertising-related use. That personal information is always encrypted except cookie IDs.

**7.2. Cooperative Database and Marketing Companies**

These companies provide what is called a “cooperative database”, which is a type of database that holds information about customers and their transaction histories through which many companies, such as ours, will contribute information to the database in return for aggregate information on the customers other companies have provided. None of the companies that participate in these cooperative databases reveal which company has collected that data, so none of the participating companies are able to identify which company the data is associated with. Each email and mailing address is then associated with specific business categories (e.g., home decor, artwork, etc.) based on customers’ transaction histories. The participating companies, like ours, are then able to process, using data mining and other marketing targeting techniques, the email and mailing addresses in relation to the specific business categories they want to target in their direct mailing. Such databases are generally used for promotional mailings, credit card fraud detection, digital media targeting, business intelligence or fighting e-mail spam. In our case, these databases are used for promotional mailings and direct mail campaigns: this means that, from time to time, we share our customers’ email and mailing addresses and related transactional information, such as your purchase history, amounts paid and products ordered, with cooperative database and marketing companies for promotional mailings and direct mail campaigns. These types of marketing campaigns are mainly carried out in relation with our Saatchiart.com and Society6.com websites. Some of the third-party vendors who receive your personal information from us may resell it for their own direct marketing purposes, and the direct marketing purposes of other third-party marketing companies.

If you prefer to opt-out of the use of your email and mailing addresses for the above purposes, please let us know at [privacy@worldofgoodbrands.com](mailto:privacy@worldofgoodbrands.com).

**7.3. Our Service Providers and Contractors.** We share your information with service providers and contractors who work on our behalf. For example, they may handle payment or credit card processing, data management, customer data pooling or aggregating, feature administration, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. They also include accountants, auditors, lawyers, insurers or similar advisers when we ask for their professional advice. Service providers and contractors will only have access to the personal information needed to perform these limited functions on our behalf.

**7.4. Social Media Sites.** Our Services may use social networking or “share functionality” or contain links to third-party social media sites or applications that are not owned or controlled by us. We also may allow you to use social media sites or applications to leverage your existing social media site or application accounts to access features of the Services. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of personal information about you by these sites or applications, depending on the feature.

**7.5. Our Business Partners**

If you are directed to the Services through a third party, we share certain information back with that third party, which may include personal information such as name, email and value of purchase depending on the type of relationship or Services utilized.

We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for any share functionality or the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party site or application. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites or applications with which you interact to make sure you understand the personal information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites. You are subject to the policies of those third parties when and where applicable.

7.7. Other Businesses. We will disclose your personal information to other businesses in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets or any business, any user personal information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third parties in such transaction or event. We reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction or event, to transfer or assign your personal information and other personal information we have collected from users of the Services to third parties. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred user personal information will be subject to this Privacy Notice. However, any personal information you submit or that is collected after this type of transfer may be subject to a new privacy notice adopted by the successor entity or acquirer, as applicable.

**7.8. Government Authorities, National Security or Law Enforcement Agencies, Courts and Other Similar Third Parties**

We will disclose your personal information to these third parties:

* if required to do so, and to the extent permitted, by law;
* if requested in response to a subpoena or court order;
* if we believe in our sole and absolute discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud;

**F. Right to Opt-Out of Sales and Sharing**

To the extent we “sell” or “share” your personal information as those terms are defined under the CPRA, you have the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing, which you can exercise through:

* The following [USA Consumer Privacy Rights Web Form](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/6ae80e28-005a-47b1-85b4-3c150c46e71a/757eec91-f529-41e0-8d2f-73ad34248684.html) by choosing the option “Opt out” (this functionality will only remove you from our marketing email lists);
* The **“Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”** link that appears in the footer of our website.
* In addition, you may exercise this right by turning on a recognized opt-out preference signal, such as [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1678404964545575&usg=AOvVaw2x4kLA3sazs8T7p3FcV99z) , through the appropriate setting or extension of your browser or mobile device.

Note that when you submit an opt-out, except as provided below, your opt-out will only apply to sales and shares of personal information through tracking technologies from the specific browser or mobile device from which you submitted the opt-out because the connection between your browser identifiers and other personal information we have about you is not known to us. Opt-outs also apply to any pseudonymous profiles we maintain associated with your browser or device. If you want the opt-out to also apply to other personal information we have about you (such as your contact information), please use the link and provide your contact information as requested or make sure you are logged into your account when submitting the opt-out.

**G. Verification Process and Required Information**

Note that we may need to request additional information from you to verify your identity or understand the scope of your request, although you will not be required to create an account with us to submit a request or have it fulfilled. We reserve the right to deny your requests if we cannot verify your identity.

**H. Authorized Agent**

You may designate an authorized agent to make a CPRA request on your behalf. We will require proof of your consent to designating such an agent and verification of your identity as described above. Requests must be submitted through one of the designated methods above.

**I. Minors’ Right to Opt In**

We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

**J. Right to Non-Discrimination**

You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any your rights.

**K. Financial Incentives**

Financial incentives, as defined under the CPRA, include “programs, benefits, or other offerings, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, or sale of personal information about them. Although we do not consider our discounts and offerings to be a “financial incentive,” each may be interpreted to be one under California law.

We may offer discounted prices to consumers who sign up for our offerings and voluntarily provide us with certain requested personal information to be used in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

You can opt-in by submitting the requested personal information. You can withdraw your consent at any time by emailing us using the contact information below with “Opt-out of Financial Incentives” in the subject line.

We generally do not treat consumers differently if they exercise a privacy right under California law. However, you will need to provide some personal information in order to receive certain discounts or benefits. In such circumstances, we offer a price difference that is reasonably related to the value of your data to us in connection with the discount or benefit.

The price differences reflected in our discounts and offerings are provided based upon our reasonable determination of the estimated value of the data you provide to us, which takes into consideration a number of factors, including, among other things, our estimates regarding the anticipated revenue generated from such data and the actual and anticipated expenses that we incur in the collection, storage, and use of such data in connection with our discounts and offerings. If you choose to withdraw from our discounts and offerings or choose not to create an account with us, you can still continue to use our website as a guest user.

**L. Shine the Light**

Customers who are residents of California may request (i) a list of the categories of personal information (as that term is defined by Shine the Light) disclosed by us to third parties during the immediately preceding calendar year for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes; and (ii) a list of the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed such information. To exercise a request, please write us at the email or postal address set out in section 1 above and specify that you are making a “California Shine the Light Request.” We may require additional information from you to allow us to verify your identity and are only required to respond to requests once during any calendar year.

**14\. Security Measures and Storage Limits**

We provide industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal data we process and maintain. For example, we take reasonable measures to limit access to this data to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for data we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Services and you do so at your own risk. We have also put in place procedures to deal with any personal data breaches and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

Our retention periods for each category of personal information, including sensitive personal information, are based on our business needs and legal requirements. We retain personal information only for as long as is reasonably necessary for us to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and as otherwise to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements. If we continue to retain your personal data in accordance with a legal obligation, any further processing of your data will be limited to compliance with such legal obligation.

Where required by Data Protection Laws, we shall delete your personal information when we are requested to do so. Even if we delete your personal information from our active databases, some or all of the personal information you provided may be required in order for the Services to function properly and it may remain in backup storage or records retention archival media (not to be used for any other purpose) until it is permanently deleted in accordance with our standard retention schedules.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal obligations.
