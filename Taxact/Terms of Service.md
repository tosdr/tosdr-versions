TaxAct Terms of Service and License Agreement
=============================================

Notice for Pennsylvania Customers Who Used TaxAct Between 2018-2022

TaxAct is party to a lawsuit, Kirkham v. TaxAct, Inc., Civil Action No. 23-3303, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On February 12, 2024, the Court ordered that TaxAct cannot enforce the following sections of the below Terms of Service, which were updated on December 22, 2023, against any Pennsylvania customer who filed an individual online DIY tax filing between 2018-2022:

• Section 9 (“Release for Operation and Use of Services”)

• Section 13 (“Dispute Resolution; Informal Resolution; Class Waiver; Binding Arbitration; Coordination of Claims & Termination of Rights”); and

• Section 14 (“Jurisdiction and Venue”)

The Order does not prohibit TaxAct from enforcing these sections if Kirkham is dismissed or if class certification is denied. The Order applies only to claims that were asserted or could have been asserted in Kirkham.

Last Updated: December 22, 2023

4\. Electronic Filing Services

If you choose to file your return electronically, your tax return will be forwarded to TaxAct's Electronic Filing Center, where it will be converted to and stored in a standardized format and then, transmitted to the applicable federal or state taxing authority. TaxAct cannot guarantee that the taxing authority will accept your return, as rejections may occur due to circumstances beyond TaxAct's control (e.g., incorrect user information, malfunction of the taxing authority's system, etc.). Your e-filing fee, if any, is non-refundable even if your return is rejected by the taxing authority. You are responsible for verifying the status of your return to confirm that it has been received and accepted by the applicable taxing authority and, if necessary, for filing it manually. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires TaxAct to provide notification to it of information relating to your use of the Services, such as notice of your electronic filing of your tax return, of the Internet Protocol (IP) address and other device information of the computer from which your return originated, and of whether your email address was collected. By using the Services to prepare and submit your tax return, you consent to the disclosure to the IRS and any other tax authority, revenue authority, or other governmental authority with jurisdiction of any information pertaining to your use of the Services. You agree that TaxAct is permitted to access and use any tax return and other information provided by you to perform the Services and, if necessary, to access such information to obtain contact information in order to provide you with notifications relating to the Services.

###   
  
  
5\. Modifications

In addition, TaxAct reserves the right, at any time, to change the terms of this Agreement. If TaxAct makes changes to this Agreement, TaxAct will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending an email to the email address associated with your account, posting a notice on the Services or updating the date at the top of this Agreement. Your continued use of the Services after any such changes will confirm your acceptance of the then-current version of this Agreement. ’If you do not agree with any such changes, you must immediately discontinue your use of the Services.

###   
  
  
6\. Satisfaction Guaranteed for Registered Users

If you are a registered user using the Services online and are dissatisfied with the Services prior to completing the billing steps within the program, your exclusive remedy is to immediately discontinue using the Services. If you are a registered user who completed the billing steps and have not printed or e-filed or your e-file was rejected by the IRS or State and you cannot re-file, it is your responsibility to contact us within the calendar year of the purchase to request a refund of fee(s) paid.

###   
  
  
7\. Limited Warranty for TaxAct Products

TaxAct warrants the accuracy of its calculations to registered users of its consumer (not professional or small business) tax filing products. If you are a registered user of one of these consumer products and you (a) e-file your return (b) are not a current and former employees of TaxAct or any other company offering tax return preparation products, and (c) either ultimately receive a smaller tax refund, ultimately owe a larger tax liability, or pay an IRS penalty solely because of a calculation error within the product and not as a result of, among other things, your failure to enter all required information accurately, your overriding of the results of calculations generated by the product, your willful or fraudulent omission or inclusion of information on your tax return, your misclassification of information on your tax return, or your failure to file an amended return to avoid or reduce your penalty after TaxAct has announced updates or corrections to its products, then TaxAct will (i) pay to you the amount of the difference attributable to any smaller tax refund ultimately received or larger tax liability ultimately owed as compared to the amount determined without error by another tax preparation product using the same data; and (ii) pay to you the original assessment amount of the IRS penalty and interest paid by you to the IRS; provided that any such amounts to be paid to you by TaxAct shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). TaxAct encourages you to visit TaxAct's website for updated information on the Services (www.taxact.com/support). You are responsible for keeping TaxAct apprised promptly of any change in your email so that notices of such updates or corrections can be provided by TaxAct. If you believe that a product calculation error occurred and you have complied with the above conditions, please notify TaxAct in writing at TaxAct, Customer Support, 3200 Olympus Blvd, Suite 150, Dallas, Texas 75019 as soon as you learn of the mistake (and in no event later than 60 days from when you filed your return or, in the event of a claimed penalty, 30 days after the penalty is assessed). You must include a copy of the IRS notice, a copy of the applicable hardcopy tax return, and your user identification information. Your filing of such a claim shall constitute your authorization for TaxAct to obtain and review any data files that may be in TaxAct's possession or control in order to evaluate your claim. You are responsible for paying any additional tax liability you may owe, and providing assistance and additional information as reasonably requested by TaxAct.

###

IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY." YOU ALSO WAIVE ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY DISPUTES UNDER ANY OTHER STATUTE OR COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE ONLY THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.

13\. Dispute Resolution; Informal Resolution; Class Waiver; Binding Arbitration; Coordinated Disputes & Termination of Rights

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT LIMITS CERTAIN LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, DISPUTE OR ACTION, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. Other rights that we or you would have in court, such as an appellate review, also may not be available in the arbitration process described within this section.**

**Informal Resolution.**

In the unlikely event that a disagreement arises between you and TaxAct regarding any claim or controversy at law or equity arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services (collectively, "**Dispute**"), prior to initiating any legal action, you must first contact us directly by email at legalnotices@taxact.com. You must describe the nature of the Dispute, the basis for your Dispute and the resolution you are seeking.

You agree that the term "**Dispute**" in these Terms and Conditions will have the broadest meaning possible. These Terms and Conditions also cover any Dispute between you and any officer, director, board member, agent, employee, affiliate of TaxAct, or third party if TaxAct could be liable, directly or indirectly, for such Dispute.

During the 60 days from the date you first contacted us, you and we agree to engage in good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute and you will not initiate any legal action during this period. You and we agree to toll any statutes of limitations that may apply, along with any filing deadlines during this 60 day time period.

**Class Waiver**

YOU AND TAXACT AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES IS PERSONAL TO YOU AND TAXACT AND THAT ANY DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED SOLELY THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WILL NOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION.

**Binding Arbitration**

If the Dispute is not resolved within the 60 day informal resolution period (and the parties do not agree to extend the period), you and we agree that the Dispute will be resolved entirely through binding individual arbitration in Dallas County, Texas or the location of the registered user, or as we and you otherwise agree in writing. If the parties have more than one Dispute between them, you and we agree to assert all such Disputes in a single arbitration so they may be resolved at the same time or they will be deemed waived.

We agree to meet and confer to select a neutral arbitrator. If we are unable to agree on an arbitrator, you or we may petition the state or federal courts sitting in Dallas County, Texas to appoint an arbitrator from the arbitrators that you and we propose. Regardless of the arbitrator or arbitration provider selected, the arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures or other comparable rules to which you and we agree.

WITH ARBITRATION (i) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (ii) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (iii) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

You and TaxAct agree that the terms of this Agreement affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "**FAA**"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by this Agreement. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and TaxAct agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and TaxAct will pay the remaining arbitration provider’s fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by TaxAct, TaxAct will pay all of the arbitration provider’s fees and costs. You and TaxAct agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Texas and the United States sitting in Dallas County, Texas have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

Notwithstanding the forgoing, this Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following Disputes (i) qualifying individual Disputes in small claims court in the county of your or TaxAct’s billing address. and/or (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction in Texas for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property.

**Coordinated Disputes**

You and we agree that the following procedures apply for Coordinated Disputes. If twenty-five (25) or more similar Disputes are asserted against TaxAct at or around the same time by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise consistent or coordinated ("**Coordinated Disputes**"), and your Dispute is one such Dispute, you understand and agree that the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed. Further, you agree that TaxAct, in its sole discretion, may elect to opt the Disputes out of arbitration and require the Disputes to proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas consistent with the remainder of this Agreement, including the class and collective action waiver. Notwithstanding this option available to TaxAct, should the Disputes proceed in arbitration, batching procedures to reduce the costs and gain efficiencies associated with litigating multiple cases shall be implemented. Twenty-six (26) Disputes shall be selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a first batching process, thirteen (13) of which will be selected by the claimants and their coordinated counsel and thirteen (13) of which will be selected by TaxAct. The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration provider fees be assessed in connection with those Disputes until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the staged process described herein.

If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining Disputes after the conclusion of the initial twenty-six proceedings, the parties shall participate in a global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining Disputes through mediation at this time, then twenty-six (26) Disputes shall be selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second batching process, thirteen (13) of which will be selected by the claimants and thirteen (13) of which will be selected by TaxAct. (If there are fewer than twenty-six (26) Disputes remaining, all shall proceed.) The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration provider’s fees be assessed in connection with those Disputes until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the staged process described herein. In any batching process, a single arbitrator shall preside over each proceeding, and only four proceedings may be assigned to each arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining Disputes after the conclusion of the second batch of twenty-six (26) proceedings, the parties shall participate in another global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining Disputes in mediation at this time, this staged process shall continue with no more than twenty-six (26) Disputes proceeding at any time in a staged order that is selected randomly or by the arbitration provider, until all the Coordinated Disputes, including your Dispute, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved. At any time during these proceedings, we agree to participate in a global mediation session should your counsel request it in an effort to resolve all remaining Disputes.

Any applicable statute of limitations on your Disputes and filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for Coordinated Disputes from the time any Coordinated Dispute is selected for the first set of batching proceedings until the time your Dispute is selected to proceed in arbitration, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this section regarding Coordinated Disputes and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against TaxAct. Should a court of competent jurisdiction decline to enforce these Coordinated Dispute procedures, you and we agree that your and our counsel shall engage in good faith and with the assistance of a process arbitrator to devise and implement procedures that ensure that arbitration remains efficient and cost-effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the selected arbitration provider to address reductions in arbitration fees. If this Section regarding Coordinated Disputes is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or batch, then it shall be severed as to that claimant or batch, and those parties shall arbitrate in individual proceedings in accordance with this Section.
