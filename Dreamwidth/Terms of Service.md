Terms of Service
================

We hate legalese, so we've tried to make ours readable. If you've got any questions, feel free to [ask us](https://www.dreamwidth.org/support/submit), and we'll do our best to answer.

Terms of Service
----------------

Dreamwidth Studios, LLC ("we", "us", "our", "Dreamwidth") present the following terms and conditions, which govern your use of the Dreamwidth site (Website), and all content, services and products available at or through the Website, including but not limited to https://www.dreamwidth.org.

The Website is offered subject to your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained within, along with all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, Dreamwidth's [Privacy Policy](https://www.dreamwidth.org/legal/privacy)) and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Website by us (collectively, the Agreement).

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Website. By accessing or using any part of the Website, you agree that you are bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then you may not access the Website or use any services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by Dreamwidth Studios, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. The Website is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old.

If you operate an account, comment on an account, post material to the Website, post links on the Website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Website (any such material, also known as "Content"), you are entirely responsible for that Content and any harm that may result from it. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, a video file, or computer software.

I. Your Account
---------------

If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the account. You must take reasonable steps to guard the security of your account. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions resulting from a breach of security, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

II. Account Structure
---------------------

Dreamwidth Studios currently has a tiered account structure.

* _Free Accounts_ can be registered free of charge. Free accounts can access basic site features, but do not receive access to all of the extended site features.
* _Paid Accounts_ are available for term-based fee and receive access to all extended site features.
* _Premium Paid Accounts_ are available for term-based fee and receive access to all extended site features, at higher limits (for those features that have limits) than those given to paid accounts.
* _Seed Accounts_ are reserved for those who have contributed significantly to the Dreamwidth Studios project, at our discretion. They receive all features available to premium paid accounts, at those limits, for as long as Dreamwidth Studios continues to operate, without need for future payment.

Payments to Dreamwidth Studios, for account services or for any other purpose, are refundable or transferable solely at Dreamwidth's discretion.

By using this Service, you agree to this account structure, and to Dreamwidth's right to change, modify, or discontinue any type of account or the features available to it at any time.

-------------

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Dreamwidth Studios, LLC, its contractors, its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Website, including but not limited to out of your violation of this Agreement.

V. Termination
--------------

We may terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, at our sole discretion, if we believe that you have violated this Agreement. You agree that any termination of your access to the Website may involve removing or discarding any content you have provided.

If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may delete your account and cease using the Website. You agree that, upon deletion of your account, we may, but are not required to, remove any content you have provided, at any time past the deletion of your account.

Paid accounts that are terminated for violations of this Agreement will only be refunded at our discretion, and only if such termination should come under our established criteria for issuing refunds.

All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

VI. License to Reproduce Content
--------------------------------

By submitting Content to us for inclusion on the Website, you grant us a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content, solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting the contents of your account, including through downloadable clients and external feeds.
