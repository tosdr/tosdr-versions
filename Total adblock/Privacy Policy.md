Privacy Policy
--------------

#### Data Respect Statement

We are Total Security Limited doing business as TotalAdBlock ("Total Security Limited"). Our company details are set out at the end of this document.

Our use of your personal information is regulated under:

* the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)) for as long as the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union or is subject to any transition arrangements after leaving the European Union;
* the Data Protection Act 2018; and
* any other privacy related laws or regulations the UK may implement as a result of it leaving the European Union.

We are responsible as “Controller” for the purposes of those laws.

As a company we are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of your personal information. We want you to be confident that your information will be properly protected whilst in our possession.

The Privacy Policy below explains how we, and carefully selected third parties we work with, will collect and use the personal information of our customers and suppliers and users of our websites. If this describes you, please read the Privacy Policy carefully and make sure you’re comfortable with the content.

We will only ever use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:

* Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
* Where it is necessary for our legitimate business interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
* Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal information other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to these activities at any time by contacting us at [dataprotection@totaladblock.com](https://help.totaladblock.com/contact)

If you have any questions about our use of your personal information, or you wish to exercise one of your rights under the GDPR, please contact us at [dataprotection@totaladblock.com](https://help.totaladblock.com/contact)

You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.

We do not envisage that any decisions will be taken about you using automated means, but we will notify you in writing if this position changes.

#### Your Data Protection Rights

Location of Personal Information and Transfers.

Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (**EEA**) and the United Kingdom so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA and the United Kingdom.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA (where relevant) or the United Kingdom, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

* We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an ‘adequate’ level of protection for personal data by the relevant authority or body.
* Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the by the relevant authority or body (Model Clauses)
* Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield (or similar arrangement) which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the UK and the US; or
* Any other safeguard approved by the UK Government or Information Commissioner’s Office.

Please contact us by visiting our [Help Center](https://help.totaladblock.com/__/contact/support/privacy) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data to any country outside the United Kingdom.

#### Rights of Access, Correction, Erasure, and Restriction

**Your rights in connection with personal information.** Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

* **Request access** to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
* **Request correction** of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
* **Request erasure** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
* **Object to processing** of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
* **Request the restriction of processing** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
* **Request the transfer** of your personal information to another party.

If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact us by visiting our [GDPR Hub](https://www.totaladblock.com/gdpr)

_No fee usually required_

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

_What we may need from you_

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

_Time limit to respond_

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

#### Third Party Links and Services

We may provide links to other third party websites as a convenience to you (collectively, the “Third Party Websites”). Please exercise care when visiting any Third Party Websites. The Third Party Websites have separate and independent privacy policies, notices and terms of use which govern your use of such websites and their use of any information they collect, we recommend you read these policies carefully. Total Security Limited expressly disclaims all liability for Personal Information you provide to any Third Party Websites.

#### Dispute Resolution

Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of Personal Information should be directed to us at the address given below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.

If we are unable to resolve your complaint, you can escalate the issue in accordance with the dispute resolution procedure set out in the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.totaladblock.com/terms).

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues or if you are based in the European Union, your local supervisory authority.
