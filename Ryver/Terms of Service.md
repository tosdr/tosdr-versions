These Terms of Service (“Terms”, “TOS”) govern your access to and use of the websites, services, and applications (collectively the “Service”) of Ryver LLC, a Delaware corporation (“Ryver”, “we” or “our”). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

### 1.0 Using the Service

**1.1** BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO THESE TERMS. THIS INCLUDES YOUR AGREEMENT TO (A) JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE FOR ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE REGARDING THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS, (B) THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND (C) THE INFORMATION COLLECTION AND PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR THE SERVICE.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.

**1.2** You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Ryver, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. The Service may change from time to time as we evolve, refine or add more features to the Service, often without prior notice to you. In addition, Ryver may temporarily or permanently stop providing the Service, or any features within the Service, to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.

### 2.0 YOUR CONTENT AND ACCOUNT

**2.1** Some areas of the Service allow you to post or upload information, text, graphics, or other material (“Content” or, when posted by you, “your Content”), and to share your Content with others. You are solely responsible for your Content and any postings, data or transmissions using the Service, or any other use of the Service by you or any person or entity that you permit to access or otherwise use the Content. You are responsible for keeping your account permissions, billing, and other account information up to date, and you must use reasonable security precautions in connection with your use of the Service. You shall immediately notify Ryver of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security and cooperate with Ryver’s investigation of service outages, security issues or any suspected breach of the terms and conditions of these Terms. You must provide us accurate information when you create your Ryver account. Your Ryver account gives you access to the Services and functionality that we establish and maintain. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of users or organizations.

**2.2** You retain full ownership to your Content. Ryver does require that you grant us rights to your Content as necessary to, and for the sole purpose of, providing the Service. For example, we must be able to transmit and display our Content over computer networks for viewing on computers, mobile devices and in email notifications by you and other users in your account. We may also use third-party services such as Amazon Web Services in order to facilitate the administration and operation of the Service, thus extending the rights granted to us to the third parties only as necessary to provide the service.

**2.3** If you connect to Ryver with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service. You may never use another user’s account without permission.

**2.4** All Content in or on the Service, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted by users, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Service or endorse any opinions expressed via the Service. We may not monitor or control the Content posted via the Service and, we cannot take responsibility for such Content. If you use or rely on any Content or materials posted via the Service or obtained by you through the Service, it is at your own risk. Under no circumstances will Ryver be liable in any way for any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content in the Service.

**2.5** You agree that you are responsible for your use of the Service, for your Content, and for any consequences thereof, including the use of your Content by other users and third parties. You understand that if you do not have the right to submit Content to the Service, doing so may subject you to liability. Ryver will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by Ryver in accordance with these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content that you submit including all necessary rights to upload your Content for use in accordance with these Terms.

### 3.0 YOUR LICENSE

**3.1** Subject to your adherence to these Terms, Ryver gives you a limited, personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-sublicensable and non-exclusive license to use the Service. We can terminate this license at any time for any reason or for no reason.

**3.2** We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device or desktop application (“Software”). In order to use the Software you must use a device that is compatible with the Software. We do not warrant that the Software will be compatible with your device.

You agree that we may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Software that you are using on your device. You agree to the automatic upgrading on your device, and agree that the terms and conditions of these Terms will apply to any upgrades.

This license is not a sale of the Software or any copy thereof, and Ryver or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Software (and any copy thereof).

**3.3** If the Service or Software is being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision applies. The Service and the Software, each, is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995) and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202 (June 1995).

* seek to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise;
* post or transmit any Content that contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable;
* post or transmit any Content that contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships;
* impersonate others through the Service or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse, or deceive others;
* publish or post other individual’s private or personally identifiable information, such as credit card numbers, street address or Social Security/National Identity numbers, without their express authorization and permission;
* publish or link to malicious content intended or reasonably likely to damage or disrupt another user’s browser or computer or to compromise a user’s privacy;

* interfere with, or disrupt, the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Service, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Service.

**5.2** International users agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content. We may investigate and/or suspend your account if you violate any of the above rules. Furthermore, we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account without further notice in the event that, in our sole and absolute judgment, you violate these Terms, or abuse the use of our Service.

**5.3** You grant Ryver the right, but without obligation, to remove or refuse to distribute any public-facing Content on the Service including your Content. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information (public or private) as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Ryver, its users and the public. If Ryver needs to access your Content in order to provide support, we will inform you and request permission to access just the Content related to the support issue.

### 6.0 PAYMENT POLICY

**6.1 Payment Terms**

* When upgrading from the free Ryver Team Communication service to one of the premium services such as Team Task Manager, fees are specified in the “Upgrade” form, and must be paid in advance. Payments and Payment Obligations for services are non-refundable.

**6.2 Cancellation**

* If you cancel your service in the middle of a period that has already been paid for, you will continue to have access to that service for the remainder of the subscription period. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature.

**6.3 Subscription Renewal**

* Subscriptions will be automatically renewed at the interval determined at time of purchase (monthly/yearly). Failure to process the credit card on file will result in multiple retries over a seven day period, during which the paid service will continue to be available.

**6.4 Unpaid Subscriptions**

* After 7 days, the account will be considered unpaid, and the customer may be downgraded to the free service level. Please note that if this happens and you lose access to your team tasks, the data will remain and be available upon payment and resuming of the premium tier service.

**6.5 Downgrades and Customer Credit**

* It is possible to “downgrade” from a higher cost plan to a lower cost plan, or from a yearly payment to monthly. If you do choose to move to a lower cost plan, resulting in credit for unused time on your higher cost plan, you will see that in your invoices as a negative total for your invoice services.
* You will not receive a refund on the remaining credit. Rather, future subscription payments will be pulled from your available credit until it is necessary to charge your credit card again.

### 7.0 PRIVACY

**7.1** We care about the privacy of our users. We collect, use and share personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information as described in our Privacy Statement located at [https://ryver.com/privacy-policy/](https://ryver.com/privacy-policy/) (the “Privacy Statement”). By using the Service, you agree to the collection of such information, and to have your personal data collected, used, transferred to and processed in the United States in accordance with the Privacy Statement. The terms and conditions of the Privacy Statement are hereby incorporated by reference.

### 8.0 DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (DMCA) NOTICE

**8.1** Ryver assumes no liability with respect to disputes over Content ownership, copyright, or trademarks. In the event that we are notified that your Content allegedly infringes the copyright rights of a third party, we will follow the procedures set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) for taking down your Content and notifying you of the same. If you provide us with a counter-notice pursuant to the DMCA, we will follow the procedures outlined in the DMCA for addressing such counter-notice and potentially reposting your Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we retain the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to remove your Content or refuse to publish the same for other reasons, including without limitation, trademark or other ownership disputes.

**8.2** It is our policy to terminate the account of any users who are repeat infringers of others’ copyrights or trademarks.

### 9.0 LINKS TO THIRD-PARTIES

**9.1** The Service may have links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by us. The primary source for such links would be from user-generated Content. The Service may present previews of publicly available content associated with the links. However, we do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any of these third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access a third party website from the Service, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these Terms and our Privacy Statement do not apply to your use of those sites. You expressly relieve Ryver from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, service, or content and agree that your dealings with any third-party website, service, or content is only between you and such third parties. You agree that we are not responsible for any loss or damage of any sort in your dealings with such advertisers.

You further agree to assume responsibility for and bear all expenses relating to your compliance with the described laws, regulations, rules and orders, and obtaining all necessary authorizations and clearances.

### 11.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

**11.1** “Confidential Information” means all confidential and proprietary information of a party disclosed either before or after the effective date of these Terms and marked as such (if such information is capable of being so marked) regarding such party’s products and business that are disclosed by such party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Non-Disclosing Party”) under these Terms including, but not limited to, the Disclosing Party’s intellectual property. Confidential Information also includes (a) the unpublished prices and other terms of service, audit reports, data center designs and other proprietary technology and (b) all information transmitted to or from, stored on or otherwise processed by the servers or other devices used in the provision of the Service. Confidential Information does not include information: (i) in the public domain at the time of delivery, (ii) subsequently published or otherwise made part of the public domain through no fault of the Non-Disclosing Party or its representatives, (iii) in the Non-Disclosing Party’s possession at the time of disclosure and not acquired by the Non-Disclosing party directly or indirectly from Disclosing Party or its representatives on a confidential basis, (iv) which becomes available to the Non-Disclosing Party on a non-confidential basis from a source not under an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, or (v) information that is independently developed without reference to the Confidential Information, as evidenced by written records maintained in the ordinary course of business.

**11.2** Each party will safeguard and keep confidential all Confidential Information of the other and will return the other’s Confidential Information upon request, except to the extent further retention of such Confidential Information is necessary for a party to perform any post-termination obligations or exercise any post-termination rights under these Terms. Each party agrees to safeguard the other’s Confidential Information using measures that are equal to the standard of performance used by the Non-Disclosing to safeguard its own Confidential Information of comparable value, but in no event less than reasonable care. Neither party will use any Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except to implement its rights and obligations under these Terms and as otherwise expressly contemplated by these Terms; provided, however, that if any party or its representatives is requested or required to disclose any Confidential Information by a subpoena or court order, that party will promptly notify the other party (unless prohibited by such subpoena or order) of such request or requirement so that the other party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate relief and/or waive compliance with provisions of these Terms, and if, in the absence of such relief or waiver hereunder, any party or its representative are, in the opinion of its counsel, legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, then that party may disclose so much of the Confidential Information the person compelling disclosure as is, according to such opinion, required, without liability hereunder.

### 12.0 YOUR REPRESENTATION

**12.1** You represent and warrant that (i) you have adequate legal capacity to enter into these Terms, (ii) you will use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms and (iii) you will not use the Service in violation of (a) any law, regulation, or ordinance or (b) any right of Ryver, its licensors, or any third party, including, without limitation, any right of privacy, publicity, patent, copyright or trademark.

### 14.0 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

**14.1** You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms, your breach or threatened breach of these Terms may cause Ryver irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate and that Ryver, therefore, may seek timely injunctive relief to protect its rights under these Terms, without the necessity of posting a bond, in addition to any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.

### 15.0 NO WARRANTY

**15.1** YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” RYVER AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, VIRUS FREE, AND ABLE TO OPERATE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED BASIS, THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT ERRORS IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICE IS MERCHANTABLE, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURATE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NEED, OR NON-INFRINGING, UNLESS SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION. FURTHER, RYVER AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SERVICE IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. IN ADDITION, ANY SECURITY MECHANISMS IMPLEMENTED BY THE SERVICE HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS, AND YOU MUST DETERMINE THAT THE SERVICE SUFFICIENTLY MEETS YOUR REQUIREMENTS.

IN ANY CASE, THE RYVER GROUP’S ENTIRE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE SUM OF THE FEES YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE (IF ANY) AND REPLACEMENT OF DEFECTIVE MEDIA OR PROVISION OF A REASONABLY SIMILAR PRODUCT, AS DETERMINED AT RYVER’S SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF RYVER TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS THE LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN SUCH CASES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SOTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE RYVER GROUP IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF CONTENT PROVIDED BY YOU IN THE FORM OF FEEDBACK, CONTENT OR OTHERWISE. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE RYVER GROUP BE HELD RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED OR ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR RELIANCE UPON ANY CONTENT, GOODS, OR SERVICES AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH ANY EXTERNAL SITES LINKED FROM THE SERVICE.
