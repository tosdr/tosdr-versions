3. PURCHASE, PRICE INFORMATION, PAYMENT TERMS AND REFUND POLICY
    ============================================================
    
    You must be 18 years old in order take out a subscription to the Products or to make any purchase in connection with the Products.
    
    1. _Subscription._ Brain.FM Products require you to purchase a subscription for a period of time as specified during sign-up (collectively a “Subscription”). Your Subscription, which may start with a trial period, will automatically renew at the interval you select when purchasing (monthly, trimonthly, or yearly) unless you cancel your Subscription as provided in Section 3(d) or we terminate your Subscription as provided in Section 11.
    2. _Promotion/Trials._ Brain.FM, vendors, or other third parties with whom we contract to provide the Products may offer special promotions/trials with differing conditions and limitations which may be subject to different terms from these Terms. You are solely responsible for reviewing any additional terms governing your use of such special promotions or trials before accessing any special promotions or trials.
    3. _Payment Methods._ In connection with any Subscriptions that you select to purchase you must provide Brain.FM with a current, valid, accepted method of payment, which may change from time to time ("Payment Method"). All Subscription purchases are subject to this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions, including any fees, imposed by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier, as applicable. You are solely responsible for reviewing the terms of use, privacy policy or any other terms governing your use of the services provided by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier. By providing a Payment Method in connection with any Subscription, you hereby authorize Brain.FM to debit the total cost of said Subscription and agree to be responsible for any foreign transaction charges associated with your Subscription purchase. Should charges for which you are responsible fail at the time payment is required, you will be responsible for costs associated with Brain.FM’s efforts to collect amounts due. You represent and promise to us that all information you provide in connection with the purchase of a Subscription is true, accurate and complete. The duration and cost of Subscriptions are set by Brain.FM in its sole discretion. When you purchase a Subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your initial agreement to subscribe. If the price of the Subscription increases later, we will provide you with written notice before the end of the billing period in which the change is made where required by law. If you do not accept the change to your Subscription, you will be entitled to terminate this Agreement.
    4. _Billing Cycle._ As indicated during sign-up, the fee for certain Subscriptions must be paid in a single upfront payment while other Subscriptions may allow payment on an installment basis. If the Subscription fee is paid in a single upfront payment, the total Subscription fee is due and payable to Brain.FM immediately upon sale and your Payment Method will be automatically billed at that time. If the Subscription fee is paid on an installment basis, your Payment Method will automatically be billed at the beginning of each installment period as specified during sign-up.
    5. _Automatic Renewal._ In order to provide continuous service, Brain.FM automatically renews all Subscriptions on the date the Subscription expires. Such renewals will be for the same duration of the original subscription term and will be billed at the non-discounted rate for the Subscription as of the date of your enrollment and according to your original billing cycle method (i.e. either as a single upfront payment or an installment basis). By enrolling in a Subscription, you agree that your Subscription will be subject to the above-described automatic renewals unless you cancel your Subscription in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. You also agree that the amount billed may be different if your original Subscription was purchased using a promotional/trial offer and you authorize Brain.FM to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts as indicated at the time of sign-up, and any other charges, including any foreign transaction charge, that you may incur in connection with your use of the Subscription. Your Subscription will remain in effect and continue to renew automatically until it is cancelled.
        
        IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR AUTOMATIC SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL, you may do so by visiting your account overview page, clicking on “Membership” and then clicking “Cancel your membership.” Brain.FM will make reasonable efforts to process cancellation requests within two business days from the receipt of the cancellation request. If you purchased your Subscription through a third-party, like an app store, you must cancel the renewal directly with that third-party.
        
    6. _Refund Policy._ Refunds cannot be claimed for any partial Subscription Term. You must cancel your Recurring Subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current subscription period to avoid being charged for the next subscription period.
        
        If you reside in a country that is part of the European Union and have purchased a Subscription, you have the right to receive a full refund within fourteen (14) days of purchase, but only if you have not started to stream or download any Product Content (as defined in Section 6, below) through the Products. You hereby explicitly acknowledge that you lose your right to receive a refund once the streaming or downloading of the Product Content has started. If you reside in a country that is part of the European Union and you terminate your Subscription or cancel your payment after fourteen (14) days of purchase of the subscription to the Services, we will not issue a refund for any fees paid to us, including any advance charge(s) or payment(s) for any subscription term for the Services. If you are eligible for a refund (where applicable), refunds will be issued to the credit or debit card you provided when you activated the Services, and you should allow between 7 and 10 business days for the credit to appear in your account
        
    7. _Charge Backs._ If you dispute Subscription charges with your credit card company or financial institution, and Brain.FM’s investigation determines the charges were valid, we may, on reasonable written notice to you, charge to your Brain.FM account the reasonable required cost of responding to your charge back request.
