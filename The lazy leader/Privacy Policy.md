Your privacy is important to us. It is the Lazy Leader’s policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you.

Accordingly:

* we do not sell your data,
* we do not track you,
* we neither use third-party trackers nor third-party cookies, except for a strictly necessary third-party cookie used for fraud prevention purposes (see our [cookie policy](https://thelazyleader.co/cookie-policy/#necessary-cookies) for more information) with our website.

TL;DR
-----

When you log in to our website, you need to use an email and a password. Names or nicknames are optional. Password verification relies on a cryptographic hash of your password, which is stored in our database using the [Bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt?ref=thelazyleader.co) algorithm. When cancelling your account, we delete your data in our database, so you cannot recover your account. Deleting a user is irreversible and will delete all data (including post content) associated with the user.

Except for a strictly necessary cookie, which is set for fraud prevention purposes, we only use first party cookies. We use these cookies to store your login information and site preferences, e.g., when you change the page layout or theme.

A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies store user preferences and other information.

You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a website attempts to set a cookie.

If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from [https://thelazyleader.co](https://thelazyleader.co/). In such a case, this will affect your login attempts, and we will be unable to provide you with some of your desired content and services.

Our site contains links to third-party websites and services, and those sites and services have their privacy policies. After following a link to third-party content or services, you should read their privacy policy to understand how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our site.

This policy is effective as of 13 May 2021.

Last updated: **8 November 2022**.

Information We Collect
----------------------

Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person such as name, address, your devices, and even information about how you use a website or online service.

Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected” information.

Voluntarily provided information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using or participating in any of our services.

Automatically collected information refers to any information sent by your device as a matter of course when using our services.

### Log data

When you visit this website, servers automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser. This includes your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details about your visit.

Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site, data about the error and the circumstances of its occurrence is collected. This data includes your user ID, what you were attempting to do when the error happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even as they occur, or that they have occurred, or the nature of the error.

Please bear in mind that while this information cannot identify you by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to identify individual persons.

### Device data

When you visit our website or interact with our services, we collect data about your device, such as:

* device type, i.e., desktop, laptop, mobile, or tablet,
