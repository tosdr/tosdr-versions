Cloudflare Cookie Policy
========================

_Last Updated: October 19, 2023_

_This Cloudflare Cookie Policy (“Policy”) outlines the general policy, practices, and types of cookies that Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) may use to improve our Services and your experience when visiting our Websites. For the purposes of this Policy, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meanings given in our_ [_Privacy Policy_](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)_._

* * *

Our Websites and Services use cookies and other similar technologies (collectively in this Policy, "cookies"), in order to provide a better service to you, to help keep your account safe, and to generally improve our Websites and Services. Cookies perform essential functions, such as ensuring a webpage loads correctly and securely. They also help us provide you with a consistent and efficient experience. For example, we may use cookies to remember which language you prefer, to remember that you are a repeat visitor so we can direct you to the appropriate part of our Websites, or to present you with services that are matched to your preferences.

Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. They are used by many websites to store and receive identifiers and other information on devices, such as a handheld phone or computer. You can learn more about cookies and their functions generally by visiting an information website such as [https://knowcookies.com](https://knowcookies.com/).

We also may include tracking pixels, which are small graphic images, in our marketing communications to determine engagement. These cookies may be set by us or by third parties with whom we have partnered to assist in our marketing efforts. We may also use our [Zaraz](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/zaraz/) product in connection with certain third-party tools on our Websites. Zaraz loads third-party tools in the cloud using the Cloudflare network, as opposed to running third-party scripts in an end user’s browsers, and improves the speed and security of websites while offering greater control over the data that third-party tools access. While Zaraz prevents the third-party scripts from loading on your browser, in some cases you may still see third-party cookies that are associated with these third-party tools placed on your devices (subject to your consent). This allows the third-party tools to function properly.

We use four categories of cookies: Strictly Necessary, Functional, Performance, and Targeting. Strictly Necessary cookies are required to deliver security and enable core site functionality and cannot be turned off. You may view a complete list of cookies and change your cookie preferences by clicking on the “Cookie Preferences” link (or, in the United States, the “Your Privacy Choices” link) in the footer of the Cloudflare homepage at [cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, however, you may be able to delete cookies yourself through your browser’s cookie manager. To do so, please follow the instructions provided by your web browser. Please note that disabling cookies will reset your session, disable auto-login, and may adversely affect the availability and functionality of our Websites and the services we can provide to you.

### Strictly Necessary Cookies.

Strictly Necessary cookies are essential to providing the Cloudflare Websites and Services to you and cannot be turned off. They provide necessary security settings or help you use our Websites’ features and Services as expected (including remembering your cookie consent preferences). Cloudflare places Strictly Necessary cookies both on Cloudflare Websites as well as on our Customers’ websites.

For example, when you visit our Websites or our Customers’ websites, as part of our Services, we may place bot detection cookies (such as "\_cf\_bm"), cookies for CAPTCHA products (like cf\_clearance, cf\_chl\_rc\_i and cf\_chl\_rc\_ni), and a load balancing cookie (\_cflb) on the computers of visitors to our Websites and of our End Users. We do this in order to identify malicious visitors to our Websites and our Customers’ websites, to assist with web-traffic filtration, and to reduce the chance of blocking legitimate users. You can learn more about these cookies \[[here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookies)\]. You cannot turn off Strictly Necessary cookies.

### Functional Cookies.

Functional cookies allow us to remember choices you make about the kind of experience you want on our Websites and to provide you with a more personalized experience. For example, a functional cookie is required to remember which language you prefer. You may choose to opt out of these cookies, but if you do, various functions of the Websites or Services may be unavailable to you or may not work as intended.

### Performance.

Performance cookies help us learn how you use our Websites to help improve their performance and design. These cookies provide us with aggregated statistical information such as number of page visits, page load speeds, how long a user spends on a particular page, and the types of browsers or devices used to access our Websites. For example, we may use cookies to understand what pages you browsed before submitting a sales request form. You may opt out of these cookies through the “Cookie Preferences” (or, in the United States, the “Your Privacy Choices” link) on cloudflare.com or through the links listed below.

Some of the Performance cookies we use are:

* Google Analytics - Tracks user behavior on the Websites, which helps us better understand how users are using the Websites. Learn more at [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/), and to opt out, visit [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
    
* Google Tag Manager - Tracks user behavior on the Websites, which helps us better understand how users are using the Websites. Learn more at [https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821), and to opt out, visit [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7519794](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7519794).
    
* Bizible - Records website and server performance with each visit to the Websites. Learn more at [http://www.bizible.com/privacy-policy](http://www.bizible.com/privacy-policy), and to opt out, visit [https://www.bizible.com/cookie-opt-out](https://www.bizible.com/cookie-opt-out).
    
* TechTarget - Tracks user behavior on the Websites, which helps us better understand how users are using the Websites. Learn more at [https://www.techtarget.com/privacy-policy-may25/](https://www.techtarget.com/privacy-policy-may25/) and to opt out, visit [https://www.techtarget.com/individual-rights-request/](https://www.techtarget.com/individual-rights-request/).
    

In addition, we also may include tracking pixels, which are small graphic images, in our email messages to determine whether the messages were opened and if the links were clicked. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels in emails we send you, you will need to disable HTML images in your email client, but that may affect your ability to view images in other emails you receive.

### Targeting.

These third-party cookies are placed by third-party advertising platforms or networks to collect information about your visits to and actions on certain pages of our Websites so that they can deliver ads for relevant Cloudflare products and services to you later, such as when you are on certain third-party sites. These cookies also track ad performance.

Cloudflare does not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). Like many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use. Making Personal Information (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (California Civil Code Sec. 1798.100 et seq.).

We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined under the California Shine the Light Act (Civil Code Sec. 1798.83). We do permit third parties to collect personal information as described in our Privacy Policy for the business purposes described here.  
  
You may opt out of Targeting cookies through the "Cookie Preferences" (or, in the United States, the “Your Privacy Choices” link) on cloudflare.com or through the links listed below. If you wish to opt-out of cookies that collect information to serve you interest-based ads generally, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) (or if located in the European Union or United Kingdom, click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)).
