Later’s Social Media Management Solution Terms of Service 
----------------------------------------------------------

Effective date: January 17, 2024

* * *

### Overview

These Social Media Management Solution Terms of Service ("Terms") exclusively govern your relationship with Victory Square Media Inc. dba Later (“Later”, “we”, “us” or “our”) and your use of the following Later websites, products and services: [http://www.later.com](http://www.later.com/) website, [http://www.latergram.me](http://www.latergram.me/) website, [http://www.lat.gr](http://www.lat.gr/) website, [http://www.linkin.bio](http://www.linkin.bio/) website, [https://app.later.com](https://app.later.com/), [http://www.submit.media](http://www.submit.media/) email, the Later Community (the “Community”) and the Later mobile application (collectively, the Later websites, products, and services are the "Social Media Management Solution") . 

For clarity, these Terms do not apply to your use of Later’s Influencer Marketing Solution by Mavrck including the [https://mavrck.co](https://mavrck.co/) website, Mavrck LLC (“Mavrck”)’s proprietary influencer marketing platform, or other influencer marketing and promotional services (the “Influencer Marketing Solution”). The Influencer Marketing Solution is owned and operated by Mavrck and subject to separate terms and conditions between you and Mavrck. 

Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service.

Your access to and use of the Service is based on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms and accept all legal consequences. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, in whole or in part, please do not use the Service.

### Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew unless you or we cancel it prior to the renewal. You may cancel your Subscription either through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team. We may cancel by giving you notice of our intent not to renew. We reserve the right to revise the terms of your Subscription, including pricing, upon a renewal of your Subscription by giving you notice of the revision(s) prior to that renewal. If you do not accept the revision(s), you may cancel your Subscription as provided above. If you do not cancel your Subscription prior to the renewal, you will be bound by the revised terms of your Subscription.

We reserve the right to revise the terms of your Subscription upon a renewal of your Subscription by giving reasonable prior notice of the change to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the change becomes effective upon the renewal. If you do not accept the change, you may cancel your Subscription as provided above. If you do not cancel your Subscription prior to the renewal, you will be bound by the revised terms of your Subscription.

A valid payment method (such as a credit card) is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You will provide us, or the payment services provider, with accurate and complete payment information required by the payment method (such as name, address and telephone number). By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees plus applicable Taxes incurred through your account to any such payment method.

If Later is obligated to collect or pay any sales, use, value-added or other taxes (“Taxes”) in respect of your Subscription (other than on Later’s net income), the Taxes will be invoiced to you along with the Subscription fee. To allow us to determine our obligations for Taxes, you agree that we may rely on the address you provide when you subscribe or the address attached to your payment method. If those addresses do not correctly identify the province, territory, state or country of your residence, then you will provide the correct information to us. You will be liable to pay, or reimburse Later, for any Taxes, interest or fines arising out of your failure to provide the correct Tax identification information to us.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

### Free Trial

Later may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees plus applicable Taxes, for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

### Fee Changes

Later, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Later will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

  

### Refunds

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Later on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Later.

You may not assign, sub-license or otherwise transfer any of your rights under these Terms.

### Exclusions

### Governing Law

These Terms will be governed by, and interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the laws in the Province of British Columbia and the laws of Canada, as applicable.

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then any remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Later and you regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements, oral or otherwise, regarding the Service.

### Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the website and the Service.

3.10         _Copyright and the DMCA_. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “**DMCA**”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials on the Services infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. Mavrck will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the DMCA and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. Notices and counter notices with respect to the Services should be sent to Mavrck at:

By Mail:  
Mavrck LLC, a Delaware limited liability company

**53 State Street  
21st Floor – Suite 2105  
Boston, MA 02109**

By Email: chiefprivacyofficer@Mavrck.co

To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:

·   an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;

·   a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;

·   a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Service, with enough detail that we may find it on the Service;

·   your address, telephone number, and email address;

·   a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and

·   a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.

If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to Mavrck:

·   your physical or electronic signature;

·   identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

·   a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and

·   your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court located within the District of Massachusetts, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received, Mavrck will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member, or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.

3.11      _Repeat Infringer Policy_. Mavrck, in its sole discretion, may limit or terminate access to the Services for users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Mavrck may also in its sole discretion limit or prevent access to the Services by any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

### 4\. Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties.

4.1       MAVRCK, ITS AFFILIATES, THE BRANDS, AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “**MAVRCK PARTIES**“) MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE CONTENT OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, OR RELIABILITY. THE MAVRCK PARTIES SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR THE TRUTH, ACCURACY, OR COMPLETENESS OF THE CONTENT OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION CONVEYED TO THE USER OR FOR ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR OMISSIONS THEREIN OR FOR ANY DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS OF THE DATA OR INFORMATION STREAM FROM WHATEVER CAUSE. YOU AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SERVICES AND THE CONTENT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

THE MAVRCK PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL OPERATE ERROR‑FREE OR THAT THE SERVICES, THEIR SERVERS, OR THE CONTENT ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR SIMILAR CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES. IF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE CONTENT RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, NO MAVRCK PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS.

THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE MAVRCK PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON‑INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

IF YOU ARE A USER FROM NEW JERSEY, THIS SECTION 4 TITLED “LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES” IS INTENDED TO BE ONLY AS BROAD AS IS PERMITTED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. IF ANY PORTION OF THIS SECTION IS HELD TO BE INVALID UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, THE INVALIDITY OF SUCH PORTION SHALL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THE APPLICABLE SECTIONS.

4.2       IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY MAVRCK PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES AND THE CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH MAVRCK PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

4.3       Some states do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. IN SUCH STATES, THE LIABILITY OF THE MAVRCK PARTIES SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

### 5\. Indemnification. 

5.1 You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Mavrck Parties from and against any claims, actions, or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from your breach of this Agreement or your access to, use, or misuse of the Content or Services. Mavrck shall provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. Mavrck reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this Section. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Mavrck’s defense of such matter.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

### 6\. Termination of the Agreement.

### 9\. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration.

9.1       PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 9 CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

9.2           _Agreement to Arbitrate._ This Section 9 is referred to as the “**Arbitration Agreement**.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Mavrck, whether relating to these Influencer Terms of Use(including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship between us, or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Influencer Terms of Use, you and Mavrck are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

9.3           _Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief_. YOU AND MAVRCK AGREE THAT WE MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND MAVRCK AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.

9.4           _Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution._ Mavrck is always interested in resolving any disputes amicably and efficiently, and most user concerns regarding the Services can be resolved quickly and to the user’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at success@Mavrck.co. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“**Notice**”). The Notice to Mavrck should be sent to 53 State Street, 21st Floor – Suite 2105, Boston, MA 02109 (“**Notice Address**”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If Mavrck and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Mavrck may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Mavrck or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Mavrck is entitled.

9.5           _Arbitration Procedures_. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“**AAA**”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “**AAA Rules**”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website at http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer\_arbitration. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Influencer Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Influencer Terms of Use and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

Unless Mavrck and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Mavrck agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

9.6           _Costs of Arbitration._ Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “**Arbitration Fees**”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Mavrck will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Mavrck will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Mavrck will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Finally, if the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, Mavrck will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail. Mavrck will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. But, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in relief, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

9.7           _Confidentiality_. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

9.8           _Severability_. If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than Section 9.3 above is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that any provision in Section 9.3 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.

9.9           _Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement_. Notwithstanding any provision in these Influencer Terms of Use to the contrary, Mavrck agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Mavrck Services, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Influencer Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Influencer Terms of Use).

### 10\. Miscellaneous.

Subject to Section 9 above, these Influencer Terms of Use are governed by the internal substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Mavrck agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Massachusetts. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of Services or these Influencer Terms of Usemust be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. Failure of Mavrck to act on or enforce any provision of these Influencer Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in these Influencer Terms of Use. No waiver shall be effective against Mavrck unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. If any provision of these Influencer Terms of Use  are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Influener Terms of Useremain in full force and effect.  Except as expressly agreed by Mavrck and you, these Influencer Terms of Useconstitute the entire agreement between you and Mavrck with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import. You may not assign these Influencer Terms of Usewithout the prior written consent of Mavrck, but Mavrck may assign or transfer these Influencer Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without restriction.
