However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of the applicable Social Media Services provider, and, as a result, Later Influence shall not have any liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of Social Media Services that may be enabled within and/or otherwise accessible through the Later Influence Services.

You may opt-out of receiving such emails by following the instructions contained in each promotional email we send you. In addition, if at any time you do not wish to receive future marketing communications, please contact us (refer to the “Contact Us” section below). If you unsubscribe from our marketing list, we will continue to contact you via email regarding the provision of the Later Influence Services and to respond to your requests.

### **3\. Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data.**

We consider your Personal Data to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale of all or a portion of our assets, transition of service to another provider, merger, reorganization, financing due diligence, bankruptcy, receivership, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. For added certainty, we may also share your Personal Data internally with our affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

Brands: Many of the Later Influence Services are offered in connection with a specific Brand.  Later Influence shares the information you provide, including Personal Data, with Brands who provide you content targeted to your interests (including opportunities to participate in community forums and other interactive experiences), in accordance with the following: (i) with your informed consent (when we or our Brands have a direct interaction with you), or (ii) when we do not obtain your Personal Data directly from you (as described above), as necessary for our, our Brands’ and/or our Users’ legitimate interests (described above) and as permitted by applicable law (you may object at any time to such sharing, as described below). A Brand may use and disclose the Personal Data it receives from Later Influence Services according to the Brand’s individual privacy policies.

Agents, Service Providers: Later Influence, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services. Such parties providers of database storage and management services, customer support services, email management solutions, Later Influence Services hosting and other information technology providers, processing payments, providers of website analytics and direct marketing campaigns services, providers of artificial intelligence-based and machine learning solutions (such as providers of visual intelligence and visual search applications for pictures and videos). We may share your Personal Data with vendors and service providers retained in connection with providing the Later Influence Services on our behalf and under our instructions. For Personal Data transferred to us from the UK, EU or EEA member countries and Switzerland in accordance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF or the Swiss-U.S. DPF, we will remain liable under the Data Privacy Framework if third-party agents or service providers that we engage to process the personal information on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework (Please see further the “Data Privacy Framework” section below.)

Legal Requirements: Later Influence may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Later Influence or our Brands, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users or the public, (iv) protect against legal liability or suspected fraud, or (v) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding violations of Later Influence’s Terms of Use.

### **4\. Account Deactivation and Deletion**

### **5\. Data Retention**

We will keep your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is longer.

If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies.

To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

**Legitimate Interest.** “Legitimate interests” means our interests in conducting our business, managing and delivering the best services to you. It also refers to our Brands’ and Users’ interest in creating engagement with Brands and each other. This Privacy Policy describes when we process your Personal Data for such legitimate interests, what these interests are and your rights. We will not use your Personal Data for activities where the impact on you overrides our interests, unless we have your consent or those activities are otherwise required or permitted by law.

### **8\. Children**

Later Influence does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Later Influence Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data through the Later Influence Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Later Influence through the Later Influence Services, please contact us, and we will delete that information from our databases.

### **9\. Links to Other Web Sites**

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Later Influence Services. The Later Influence Services may contain links to other web sites or provide you the opportunity to post to third party sites not operated or controlled by Later Influence (the “External Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the External Sites. The links from the Later Influence Services do not imply that Later Influence endorses or has reviewed the External Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

### **10\. Social Media**

Through the Later Influence Services, you may choose to access certain Social Media Services. When you elect to access and use the Social Media Services, you will be sharing your information (which will include Personal Data) with those Social Media Services. As with other External Sites, the information that you share with the Social Media Services will be governed by the privacy policies and terms of service of the providers of such Social Media Services and not by the Later Influence’s policies and procedures. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to other entities, including Later Influence.

### 11\. Cookies

We use cookies and other technologies to operate and administer the Later Influence Services, make it easier for you to use the Later Influence Services during future visits, and gather usage data on the Later Influence Services.

What Are Cookies. A “cookie” is a piece of information sent to your browser by a website you visit. By choosing to use the Later Influence Services after having been notified of our use of cookies in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, and, in applicable jurisdictions, through notice and unambiguous acknowledgement of your consent, you agree to such use.

Some cookies expire after a certain amount of time, or upon logging out (session cookies), others remain on your computer or terminal device for a longer period (persistent cookies). The Later Influence Services use first party cookies (cookies set directly by Later Influence) as well as third party cookies, as described below. For more details on cookies please visit All About Cookies.

Type of Cookies Used. The Later Influence Services use the following technologies:

* Strictly Necessary Cookies: Used to provide you (notably, when you log in at app.mavrck.co) with the services available through the Later Influence Services and to use some of their features, such as the ability to log-in and access secure areas. These cookies are served by Later Influence and are essential for using and navigating the Later Influence Services. Without these cookies, basic functions of the Later Influence Services would not work. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Later Influence Services, you cannot refuse them.
    
* Analytics/Performance Cookies: Used to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Later Influence Services when they are using them. This helps us improve the way the Later Influence Services work, for example, by making sure Users are finding what they need easily. The Later Influence Services use:
    
* Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). The information collected by Google (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. How long a Google Analytics cookie remains on your computer or device depends on what it is and what it is used for. Some Google Analytics cookies expire at the end of your browser session, whilst others can remain for up to two years. You can prevent your data from being collected by Google Analytics on the Later Influence Services by downloading and installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for your current web browser. For more information on Google Analytics privacy practices, visit: https://policies.google.com/privacy.

For more information on EverFlows’s privacy practices visit: https://www.everflow.io/legal/privacy-policy.
    

Other Technologies. From time to time we may provide our influencers and partners with pixel tags to get information about visitors’ usage of a website. Pixel tags are a technology similar to cookies that can be embedded in online content or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites (for example, to know when content has been shown to you), or to know when you have viewed particular contente. Please review the privacy or cookie policies or pop-ups provided on the applicable website you interact with to receive more information on the use of such technologies.

Your Choices. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive a notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Please see the links below for guidance on how to modify your web browser’s settings on the most popular browsers:

* Internet Explorer

Please note that if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Later Influence Services and you may not be able to benefit from the full functionality of the Later Influence Services.

If you access the Later Influence Services on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through the settings.

We partner with third parties to display advertising on Later Influence Services or to manage our advertising on other sites, as described above.

### **12\. Security**

You use Later Influence at your own risk. Later Influence takes reasonable and appropriate measures to protect the Personal Data provided via the Later Influence Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures are regularly assessed and improved according to technological developments in the field. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free. In particular, email sent to or from the Later Influence Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Later Influence via the Internet. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share information. Therefore, we cannot, and do not, guarantee that information or content posted by a User on or through the Later Influence Services will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Later Influence services or Social Media Services.

### **13\. Your California Privacy Rights**

#### 5.1 Functional cookies

Some cookies ensure that certain parts of the website work properly and that your user preferences remain known. By placing functional cookies, we make it easier for you to visit our website. This way, you do not need to repeatedly enter the same information when navigating our website.

Data collected through these cookies are processed within the scope of our legitimate interest in providing and operating our services.

#### 5.2 Statistics cookies

We use statistics cookies to optimize the website experience for our users. With these statistics cookies we get insights in the usage of our website. We ask for your consent via our Cookie Banner to place statistics cookies.

#### 5.3 Marketing/Tracking cookies

Marketing/Tracking cookies are cookies or any other form of local storage; used to create user profiles to display advertising or to track the user on this website or across several websites for similar marketing purposes. These cookies are also used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests when you are on other websites across the internet. The information collected by these cookies will be used to track visits and actions on our services, as well as to deliver reporting and analytics to us and our partners.

We also use advertising cookies, enabling us to gain insights into our advertising campaign results. We do this by creating a profile based on your behavior. With these cookies, you, as website visitor, are linked to a unique ID, but these cookies will not profile your behavior and interests to serve personalized ads.

In addition, we have included buttons for Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and TikTok to promote our profiles or help you share our content on social networks like LinkedIn, Instagram, and TikTok. These buttons work using pieces of code from Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and TikTok themselves. Such code relies on cookies or similar tracking technologies. These social media buttons can also store and process certain information so that a personalized advertisement can be shown to you.

Please read the privacy statement of these social networks (which can change regularly) to read what they do with your personal data that they process using these cookies. The data that is retrieved is anonymized as much as possible.

As these cookies are tracking cookies, we ask for your consent to place these via our Cookie Banner.
