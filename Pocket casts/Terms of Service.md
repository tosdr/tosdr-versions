**2\. Accounts and Paid Subscription Packages**

2.1 We may make certain products and/or services available to users of the Application in consideration of a subscription fee or other fees (“Premium Services”), including the ability to purchase products and services from within the Application (“In-App Products”). If you choose to use Premium Services or make purchase of In-App Products via a third-party application store (like iTunes or Google Play), then such third-party application store will charge you for any such applicable fees or charges (including any applicable taxes), according to their terms and conditions attributable to such purchase.

**2.2 If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in-app purchase, you will continue to be billed for the subscription until you or we cancel it. The initial price and billing period will be as displayed via the Application. We may change the price at any time, but price changes will only apply to new purchases (including renewals). If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your account and follow instructions (or follow the instructions from Google or Apple if you purchased via our mobile application) to cancel your subscription before the next billing period starts, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Application from your device. Deleting your member account or deleting the Application from your device does not cancel your subscription. You must cancel your Account as set forth in these Terms.**

2.3 You retain the right to cancel your subscription at any time which must be done via your Apple or Google account or the via the Pocket Casts website or desktop application (however you originally subscribed). Upon cancellation, you will continue to be subscribed to the Application until the conclusion of the relevant billing cycle, at which point your subscription and access to the Premium Services will cease.

2.4 If you cancel your subscription, following the subscription expiration date, Pocket Casts reserves the right delete all files being stored on the platform.

**3\. Billing Cycle and Payment**

3.1 The membership fee for the Premium Services, the purchase price of In-App Products, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as sales tax, VAT, and any other transaction fees, will be charged to you via your Apple or Google account or via the third-party payment gateway accessible through our website or desktop application (however you choose to subscribe). Our third-party order process is conducted by our online reseller [Paddle.com](https://paddle.com/). [Paddle.com](https://paddle.com/) is the Merchant of Record for all of these orders.

3.2 The length of your billing cycle will depend on the subscription type you select at sign-up for the subscription. Subscription fees will be payable on either an annual or per month basis.

3.3 In certain circumstances the payment date may change, for example, if your chosen method of payment has not successfully settled.

3.4 Payments will either be to Pocket Casts directly or to a third-party payment processor. Your membership will be terminated in the event of non-payment.

3.5 If a member exercises its cancellation right, Pocket Casts or its billing agents will not charge further subscription fees following the date of cancellation. Members will retain access to Premium Services until the billing cycle concludes. The expiration date will be fixed in-application at the time of subscription.

3.6 All subscription fees are non-refundable.

3.7 Pocket Casts may change your subscription fee from time to time, however, any price changes will apply to subsequent billing cycles only.

**3.8 Pocket Casts may, from time to time, offer new members a “free trial” period where subscription fees will be waived for a period of time. To avoid charges, you must cancel the free trial in the same manner as indicated above for cancellations of subscriptions before the free trial expires.**
