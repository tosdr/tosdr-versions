 

### RM and Internet Cookies

A cookie is a small text file on your computer, created by a website to store information about your visit, such as your preferences. Once a cookie is saved on your computer, only the website that created the cookie can read it. Cookies typically contain two pieces of information: a site name and a unique ID. Most major websites use cookies.

There are two main types of cookie. A **session cookie** is used in order to allow the services that you request during the session to be provided. Once you close your browser, session cookies simply terminate. An example of the information that a session cookie might capture is information about the products in your basket as you go through the purchase checkout process on a web site. A **persistent cookie** is stored on your hard disk and does not terminate when you close your browser. This means that the web site will remember your information and settings if you revisit it in the future, making access faster and more convenient. In addition, some persistent cookies are used for marketing analytics.

### Why do we use cookies?

Cookies allow our websites to function fully in order to deliver our products and services to you. They may also help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalised service to you.

For example, a cookie allows us to help identify your computer so we can tailor your user experience. If it is an e-commerce site, a cookie will remember where you are in the order process and your shopping basket to be kept separate from other users. It also enables us to automatically complete some of the forms when you subsequently use them. The creation of a cookie on your computer does not give the website any access to other information such as your email address.

Information gathered by cookies will only be used in accordance with the terms of this policy, our privacy policy and data protection legislation.

### How can you reject cookies?

Some of our websites use the OneTrust Cookie Consent Tool which enables you to directly manage your cookie preferences, including the blocking of non-essential cookies should you wish to do so.

The OneTrust Cookie Consent Tool also lists the cookies for the site you are visiting. If we have not yet implemented the Tool on the website you are visiting, then the cookies on the site are listed below. In addition, you can manage your cookie preferences as follows.

Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue essential session cookies when you log on to our sites to allow them to function fully. You may refuse to accept all types of cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting, certain sections within our websites will not be able to function as expected.

Please note that any advertisers on our website may also use cookies on their websites, over which we have no control. More information about what cookies are, why they are used, and also how you can reject and delete them, is usually found in your browser’s help section.

### IP addresses

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information.
