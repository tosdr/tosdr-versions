After the Free Trial Period has ended we will charge you for Subscription Access to the ExpertTrack using the payment method you have selected and you will not be entitled to a refund if you cancel your Subscription Access after this point.

We will charge you using the payment method you have chosen when you subscribe to Unlimited and when your Subscription Access automatically renews. You will not be entitled to any refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.

You can upgrade your Unlimited Subscription Access from a monthly to an annual plan at any time. You will be credited for the remainder of your current monthly billing period and the credited amount will be automatically applied towards the purchase of your annual plan. Your new subscription plan will start immediately.

Currently we do not offer downgrading your subscription plan from annual to monthly.

7.5. After you have signed up to Subscription Access (including Unlimited and ExpertTracks), we reserve the right to vary any recurring subscription fees from time to time and will notify you of any change to the subscription fee. Fee changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. If you do not agree with a price change you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from Subscription Access prior to the change taking effect.

7.6. You agree that in the event we are unable to collect any fees for Subscription Access owed to us, we may take other steps that we deem necessary to recover any fee owed by you to us.

16. Changes to the Website and these Terms

16.1. We may update or amend these Terms (as well as our Policies or any other guidance we issue) from time to time to comply with law or to meet our changing business requirements.
