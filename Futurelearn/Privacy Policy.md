After the Free Trial Period has ended we will charge you for Subscription Access to the ExpertTrack using the payment method you have selected and you will not be entitled to a refund if you cancel your Subscription Access after this point.

You may [cancel your Subscription Access to Unlimited via your Account](http://futurelearn.com/account/subscriptions) at any time before the end of your current subscription period and the cancellation shall take effect on the day after the last day of the subscription period.

We will charge you using the payment method you have chosen when you subscribe to Unlimited and when your Subscription Access automatically renews. You will not be entitled to any refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.

You can upgrade your Unlimited Subscription Access from a monthly to an annual plan at any time. You will be credited for the remainder of your current monthly billing period and the credited amount will be automatically applied towards the purchase of your annual plan. Your new subscription plan will start immediately.

Currently we do not offer downgrading your subscription plan from annual to monthly.

7.5. After you have signed up to Subscription Access (including Unlimited and ExpertTracks), we reserve the right to vary any recurring subscription fees from time to time and will notify you of any change to the subscription fee. Fee changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. If you do not agree with a price change you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from Subscription Access prior to the change taking effect.

7.6. You agree that in the event we are unable to collect any fees for Subscription Access owed to us, we may take other steps that we deem necessary to recover any fee owed by you to us. We reserve the right to suspend your account or any of our services until we receive payment of all fees due to us.

7.7.

13.1. You indemnify and keep us fully indemnified from and against all actions, claims, demands, costs, expenses, liabilities, loss, damages or other monetary relief brought, made or awarded against or incurred by us resulting (directly or indirectly) from:

14.8.1. if we reasonably believe you or any Learner you are connected with are in breach of any of these Terms;

14.8.2. in order to prevent any fraudulent, unlawful or abusive activity; or

14.8.3. if it is necessary to prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, other Learners of the Website or the general public.

15. Governing Law

15.1. These Terms, your use and access to the Website, and all other policies issued by us whether referred to by us herein or not are governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

15.2. Any or all disputes arising between you and us (whether contractual or non-contractual) in connection with your access and use of the Website, including as to the validity of these Terms or policy issued by us, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. For any dispute between you and us, you agree that you will first attempt to resolve it with us informally. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve the dispute in this manner within 28 days of the dispute being notified in writing, we both agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales to resolve any such dispute.

15.3. Notwithstanding paragraph 15.2, you agree that we are permitted to apply for injunctive remedies (or any other types of interim relief) in any jurisdiction at any time.

16. Changes to the Website and these Terms

16.1. We may update or amend these Terms (as well as our Policies or any other guidance we issue) from time to time to comply with law or to meet our changing business requirements. When we update our Terms or Policies, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. Any updates or amendments will be posted on the Website and you are advised to check this page every time you use the Website.

16.2. For any operational, regulatory, legal or other reason, we reserve the right to modify, suspend or discontinue all of the Online Content and Courses with or without notice to you and we will not be liable to you or any third party for any such modifications, suspension or termination. By continuing to use the Website, you agree to be bound by the terms of these updates and amendments.

17. Other Important Terms

17.1. If any of these Terms are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of these Terms remain in full force and effect.

17.2. Only you and we are entitled to enforce these Terms. No third party is entitled to enforce any of these Terms, whether by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (which is expressly excluded) or otherwise.

17.3. We may freely transfer or assign any part of our rights or delegate our obligations under these Terms. You are not entitled to transfer or assign, by operation of law or otherwise, any part of your rights or delegate your obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent.

17.4. These Terms, the Policies and the Code of Conduct set out the entire agreement between you and us and replace any and all prior terms, conditions, warranties and/or representations to the fullest extent permitted by law. Any delay or failure by us to exercise any right we may have under these Terms does not constitute a waiver by us of that right.
