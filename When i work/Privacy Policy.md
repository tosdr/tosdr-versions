For example, when you register with the Service, we collect your name, email address, password, contact information and employment information. If you are an employer, we also collect information about your business, payment information and any information you provide about your employees, including your employees’ contact information and pay-scale. We may also collect any communications between you and When I Work, any information you provide if you take part in any interactive features of the Service, and any other information you provide to us.

How we use cookies and other tracking technology to collect information.

We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Service, read our communications, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, file information and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”). For example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your account, and other such information. We also collect information about the way you use our Service, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Service from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service. When you access our Service from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (“IDFA”), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address. We may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics of our users. We may also work with third party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which attempt to recognize you across multiple devices. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time.

We use or may use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance our Service.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it. Deleting cookies does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5.

**Disclosure of personal information.**  We share personal information input into our scheduling and workplace solution with third parties for the purposes described in the “Sharing Information” section of our Privacy Policy. The categories of third parties to whom we disclose your personal information for a business purpose include: (i) if you have an employee account, the employer(s) that you direct us to share information with; (ii) our corporate affiliates; (iii) our service providers and advisors. We may share personal information we glean from your visit to our public website ([www.wheniwork.com](http://www.wheniwork.com/)) with (iv) marketing and strategic partners; (v) promotional partners; (vi) ad networks and advertising partners; and (vii) analytics providers. 

We do not currently “sell” personal information as most people would typically understand that term. However, we do allow certain third-party advertising partners to collect information about the users of our public-facing website ([www.wheniwork.com](http://www.wheniwork.com/)) for the purposes of serving ads that are more relevant, for ad campaign measurement and analytics, and for fraud detection and reporting. To learn more about online advertising and how you may be able to control some of this activity, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

**Your California Rights and Choices****.**  As a California resident, you may be able to request to exercise the following rights: 

* **The Right to Know** any or all of the following information relating to your personal information we have collected and disclosed in the last 12 months, upon verification of your identity:
    * The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you; 
    * The categories of personal information we have collected about you; 
    * The categories of sources of the personal information; 
    * The categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties for a business purpose, and the categories of recipients to whom this information was disclosed; 
    * The categories of personal information we have sold and the categories of third parties to whom the information was sold; and 
    * The business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling the personal information.
* **The Right to Request Deletion** of personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.
* **The Right to Opt Out of Personal Information Sales** to third parties now or in the future.

You also have the right to be free of discrimination for exercising these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.

**To submit your California Consumer Rights Requests****.**  You may submit a request to exercise your California Consumer Rights through one of the mechanisms described below. We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account, if you have one.  In certain circumstances, we may decline or limit your request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems, or as permitted by law.

To exercise your California Consumer Rights, please submit a request by: 

* Emailing [support@wheniwork.com](mailto:support@wheniwork.com) with the subject line “California Rights Request,” or
* Calling 1-800-977-3675

Please see our Privacy Policy for more information about how third parties use cookies and related technologies to collect information automatically on our websites and other online services, and the choices you may have in relation to those activities.

**Updates to these CA Disclosures**

We will update these CA Disclosures from time to time. When we make changes to these CA Disclosures, we will change the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these CA Disclosures.
