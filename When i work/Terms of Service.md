Terms of Service
----------------

![](https://marketing-assets.wheniwork-production.com/2020/03/06104650/Cityscape-Green.svg)

When I Work, Inc. (“**WIW**”) is a provider of a workforce management SaaS solution that offers various types of services, such as shift scheduling and time and attendance, by means of software plus a hosted workforce management platform made available by WIW via web-based and/or mobile applications (**collectively the** “**Service**”). These Terms of Service set forth the terms and conditions under which WIW agrees to provide access to and use of the Service by organizations scheduling shift workers (“**Workplaces**”**)** and by individual shift workers (“**Users**”). For ease of use, WIW’s Terms of Service are separated into a set of terms for Workplaces (“**Workplace Terms of Service**”) and a set of terms for Users (“**User Terms of Service**”).

**Read and accept the Terms of Service that apply to your organization as a Workplace or to you, individually, as a shift worker**:

### **[Workplace Terms of Service](#h-workplace-terms-of-service)**

**FOR EMPLOYERS, COMPANIES, BUSINESSES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER ENTITIES WITH SHIFT WORKERS (each a** “**Workplace**”**)** that purchase a subscription to the Service or have been provided with a no-charge or trial subscription for the Service.

### **[User Terms of Service](#h-user-terms-of-service-for-individual-shift-workers-of-a-workplace)**

**FOR INDIVIDUAL WORKERS OF A WORKPLACE (each a** “**User**”**)**, such as shift workers, admins, managers. supervisors, employees, volunteers, agents, or contractors, who have been asked or invited to register with a Workplace and to access and use the Service on behalf of that Workplace.

**PLEASE NOTE**:

* By creating a Workplace account or a registering as a User with a Workplace, by accessing or using the Service, or by clicking “I Accept”, “Continue”, “Finish”, or “Purchase” or “Sign Up for Free” or similar language affirming your intention to be bound by When I Work’s Terms of Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the applicable terms. 

* You agree to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the [When I Work Privacy Policy](https://wheniwork.com/privacy), whether or not you fully create an account or become a registered User of our Service.

* **BOTH THE WORKPLACE TERMS OF SERVICE AND THE** **USER TERMS OF SERVICE** **CONTAIN A** **MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER** PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE CERTAIN DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

* * *

#### **Workplace Terms of Service**

**FOR EMPLOYERS, COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER ENTITIES WITH SHIFT WORKERS**  

**IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL** WHO HAS BEEN ASKED OR INVITED TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE BY A WORKPLACE AS A SHIFT WORKER\*, ADMIN, MANAGER, SUPERVISOR, EMPLOYEE, VOLUNTEER, AGENT, OR CONTRACTOR OF A WORKPLACE, THE SEPARATE **USER TERMS OF SERVICE** (“**[User ToS](#h-user-terms-of-service-for-individual-shift-workers-of-a-workplace)**“) APPLY TO YOU. THESE WORKPLACE ToS DO NOT APPLY TO YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL.  

**NOTE REGARDING SHIFT WORKER CLASSIFICATION IN THE SERVICE**

\*_Shift workers, including employees, independent contractors, and volunteers of a Workplace (“_**_Users_**_”) are often referred to within the Service as “Employees”._ _Within the Service, certain Employees may be designated as Managers or Supervisors by the Workplace._ **_Naming conventions within the Service are for convenience only and are not intended to be a determination of any individual’s worker status or worker classification for any purpose, including for purposes of federal employment taxes, unemployment taxes, etc. Likewise, When I Work does not assist in the determination of whether a shift worker is exempt or nonexempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act._** **_Workplaces_** **_assume all liability for the proper classification of their shift workers based on applicable legal guidelines and for complying with all other employment laws, such as wage and hour laws_**.  

**INTRODUCTION**

1. Applicability to Workplaces. These Workplace Terms of Service (“**Workplace ToS**”) apply to employers, companies, organizations, and other entities that create an account with When I Work, Inc. (“**When I Work**,” “**WIW**,” “**we**,” or “**us**” or “**our**”) to access and use the hosted workforce management platform and software made available by WIW via web-based and/or mobile applications (collectively the “**Service**”). Workplaces must create an account in order to use the Service (“**Workplace Account**”) These terms and conditions, together with any additional terms set forth in a WIW-issued quote or other type of WIW-approved order form (such as the plans and features you choose when you create a Workplace Account online) that references these Workplace ToS, (collectively this “**Agreement**”), govern the acquisition and use of the specific software applications and features of the Service _(e.g._ Scheduling, Time & Attendance) or Third Party Services (_e.g._ Payroll or integrations using Workato) you have requested.  
      
      
    The terms “**Workplace**,” “**Account Holder**,” “**Customer**,” “**you**,” and “**your**” in these Workplace ToS, refer to the employer, company, organization, or other entity creating a Workplace Account with WIW.

PLEASE READ THESE WORKPLACE ToS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION BEFORE ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT OR PROCEEDING WITH ANY USE OF OUR SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICE. ADDITIONALLY, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND YOUR WORKPLACE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT CREATE A WORKPLACE ACCOUNT WITH WIW OR ACCESS OR USE OUR SERVICE

2. Mandatory Arbitration. **UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS IN SECTION 25.2(b) OF THESE WORKPLACE ToS, THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A** **MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION IN SECTION 25.3 THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE CERTAIN DISPUTES**, RATHER THAN THE USE OF JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.

3. Purchasing through Authorized Resellers. If your Workplace purchased a subscription to the Service from a third party authorized by WIW to sell such subscriptions (“**Reseller**”), then in addition to any terms and conditions related to your use of the Service pursuant to any agreement between you and the Reseller, these Workplace ToS contain the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Service. You expressly acknowledge and agree that (a) WIW shall have the right to enforce these Workplace ToS against you; and (b) with respect to your access to and use of the Service, these Workplace ToS supersede any and all agreements between you and the Reseller.

4. Accepting this Agreement. **This Agreement may be accepted in one or more of the following ways:** 

* Clicking “I Accept”, “Continue”, “Finish”, “Purchase” or “Sign Up for Free” or similar language indicating you agree to abide by this Agreement provided you have the authority to bind the Workplace to these Workplace ToS (See _Section (E) below for further information regarding eligibility)_;
* Executing a WIW-issued quote or other type of WIW-approved order form that references these Workplace ToS;
* Issuing a purchase order based on a WIW quote or other type of WIW-approved order form; or
* **Accessing and using the Service, even if such access began** **before** **publication of these Workplace ToS. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Workplace ToS. If you do not agree to current Workplace ToS or any updates to them, do not use or access (or continue to access and use) the Service**.

5. **BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE AS FOLLOWS**:

* If you are an individual entering into this Agreement  on behalf of a Workplace then (a) you agree that these Workplace ToS are an agreement between WIW and the Workplace; (b) you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Workplace to these Workplace ToS (and if you do not have that authority, you may not create a Workplace Account with WIW or access or use our Service); (c) your acceptance of these Workplace ToS will bind such Workplace to these terms.
    * You acknowledge and agree that if you are creating a Workplace Account or otherwise using the Service as or on behalf of a Workplace, your shift workers, employees, supervisors, managers, independent contractors, volunteers, or other individuals who register with your Workplace as a User must each separately agree to be bound by the [**User ToS**.](#h-user-terms-of-service-for-individual-shift-workers-of-a-workplace) Workplaces are responsible for each of its Users’ compliance with the User ToS.
* If you are registering, creating, accessing, or using a Workplace Account with WIW, you meet all the eligibility requirements found in Section 1.1.
* You are not a competitor of When I Work, and you will not provide any information gained from your use of or access to the Services to a competitor of When I Work.

* This Agreement is a contract with When I Work. You must use the Service (and Third Party Services) in compliance with this Agreement and with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.
* When I Work may change the Service or add, modify, or remove certain features of the Service. Notice requirements, **if any**, before When I Work changes the Service or adds, modifies, or remove certain features of the Service are set forth in the Agreement. (_See Section 3.3 for more information_).
* **If you, as a Workplace have a free trial, free subscription, or paid subscription for the Service, When I Work may permanently or temporarily terminate, suspend, or limit your access to and use of the Service (or one or more of your Users access and use of the Service) if, in our sole determination, you (or your Users) violate any provision of this Agreement.** Notice requirements, **if any**, before When I Work terminates, suspends, or limits your (or your Users’) access to and use of the Service are set forth in the Agreement.
* **If the Service is provided to you on a free subscription or a free trial subscription, When I Work may permanently or temporarily terminate, suspend, or limit your access to and use of the Service without notice.** (_See Sections 10.1 and 10.2 for more information_). If the Service is provided to you on a paid subscription plan, the termination or suspension of your Workplace Account is as set forth in Section 12.2.
* Workplace Accounts that have been cancelled by you and not reactivated within thirty (30) days and no-charge Workplace Accounts or trial subscriptions that have been inactive for more than thirty (30) days may also be removed from the Service at When I Work’s discretion and without further notice.
* When I Work reserves the right to make unilateral changes to these Workplace ToS **so you should periodically review the Workplace Terms of Service page** **and the Privacy Policy page**. WIW will provide notice of such changes as described in Section 26.3 below. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to these Workplace ToS.  
      
    **Your continued use of the Service after any such change means you accept and agree to new terms. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future terms in either the Workplace ToS or Privacy Policy, do not access or use (or continue to access and use) the Service**.

**IF YOU DO NOT OR CANNOT ACCEPT THESE WORKPLACE ToS, PLEASE EXIT THE WEBSITE OR MOBILE APP AND DO** **NOT** **ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE. AS STATED ABOVE, IF YOU ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY AND BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT.**

##### 1.3 **Payroll Services and On-Demand Pay**

**(a)** Payroll. Payroll processing and management services (“**Payroll Services**”) are a Third-Party Service powered by our Third-Party Service Provider, Check Technologies, and are available to Customers who also license WIW’s scheduling and time and attendance features of the Service. If Payroll Services are selected as an additional feature by you to be used by your Workplace in connection with the Service, then the following applies:

* In addition to these Workplace ToS, the creation of a Workplace Payroll Account and the access and use of the Payroll Services offered through WIW are subject to the [**Payroll Terms of Service- Workplaces**](#h-payroll-terms-of-service-workplaces-payroll-tos) (“**Payroll ToS**”), attached as Schedule A and incorporated herein by reference; and   
* Each of your Users who create a Payroll User Account for use with your Workplace(s) must separately agree to be bound by the [**Payroll User Terms of Service**](#h-payroll-user-terms-of-service-payroll-user-tos) (“**Payroll User ToS**”), attached here to as Schedule B.  
      
    **Payroll Services are currently available only to Workplaces in the United States and to Users who are either (a) Workplace employees   who receive from you  a W-2, federal wage and tax statement from you; or (b) independent contractors at your Workplace who receive from you a 1099-NEC or a 1099-MISC for reporting nonemployee compensation.).**  
      
    

* On-Demand Pay. On-Demand Pay (“**ODP**”) is a Third-Party Service available to certain U.S.-based Workplaces and certain Users through our Third-Party Service Provider, Clair. ODP allows your eligible Users on-demand access to a portion of the wages they have earned ahead of payday.

    **Terms specific to WIW’s On-Demand Pay provider, Clair**:
    * If you are a Workplace that chooses to offer its Users the option to use Clair for ODP, you may not charge your Users any fees to use the service provided by Clair.
    * If you are a Workplace that chooses to offer its Users the option to use Clair for ODP and later chooses to opt-out or disable this feature, it is your responsibility to notify your Users of this change.
    * To provide ODP, WIW must share certain data with Clair and Clair’s third-party service providers (such as its banking services provider). Therefore, if you opt-in for the OPD feature, you authorize When I Work to use and to share with Clair and Clair’s third-party service providers information about Users associated with your Workplace, such as number of hours worked, hourly rate, and information regarding paid and unpaid breaks.
    * Users who choose to access and use ODP must each separately agree to be bound to separate terms, including Clair’s Privacy Policy, all of which may be found at [**Clair Legal Information**](https://getclair.com/legal).

All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible and pay any applicable taxes, levies, or duties, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions, or other monetary transaction interactions. If your Workplace is tax exempt, please provide WIW with a copy of your exemption form.

##### 11.5 **Payments**.

Payment shall be in the form you select when you register for the Service, or as subsequently updated as permitted by the Service.

We also reserve the right to withhold payment or charge back to your account any amounts subject to dispute, such as in the case of credit card charge backs, pending successful resolution of the dispute. To ensure proper payment, you are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with your account, which includes without limitation applicable tax information. If we believe that we are obligated to obtain tax information and you do not provide this information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold your payments until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us that you are not a person or entity from whom we are required to obtain tax information. Any third-party fees related to returned or cancelled payments due to a contact or payment information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment. You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your participation in the Service.

If you dispute any payment made hereunder, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of such payment or from when you purport such payment would have been due, whichever is earlier. Failure to so notify When I Work shall result in the waiver by you of any claim relating to such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by When I Work. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by When I Work or have any effect under these Workplace ToS, and you shall have no audit rights hereunder. We may withhold any taxes or other amounts from payments due to you as required by law.

USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM WHEN I WORK OR THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.

#### **23\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WHEN I WORK, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WHEN I WORK BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICE OR YOUR WORKPLACE ACCOUNT OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF WHEN I WORK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THESE WORKPLACE ToS GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

#### **25\. GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION, AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER**

#####  25.1 **Governing Law**.

You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Minnesota; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Minnesota. These Workplace ToS shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Minnesota, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Workplace ToS evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws (and law of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted applicable law. If the FAA is found not to apply any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the laws of the U.S. state where you live, or the jurisdiction mutually agreed in writing by you and us. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Hennepin County, Minnesota for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data, data security, Confidential Information, or Intellectual Property Rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Hennepin County, Minnesota, USA, is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable. These Workplace ToS were drafted in the English language and this English language version of these Workplace ToS is the original, governing instrument of the understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between the English version of these Workplace ToS and any translation, the English version will prevail.

##### 25.2 **Arbitration**

(a) General. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WHEN I WORK. This Section (the “**Arbitration Agreement**”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (1) these Workplace ToS, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (2) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (3) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (4) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a Workplace or consumer (each, a “**Claim**,” and, collectively, “**Claims**”). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Workplace ToS.

(b) Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement. If you are a new Workplace, you can reject and opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Workplace ToS by emailing us at [support@wheniwork.com](mailto:support@wheniwork.com) with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Workplace ToS including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.

(c) Dispute Resolution Process. For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at [support@wheniwork.com](mailto:support@wheniwork.com) and attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that When I Work has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim by binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/), where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. County where your principal offices are or Hennepin County, Minnesota, unless you and When I Work agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (1) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (2) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (3) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Workplace ToS are, or whether any provision of these Workplace ToS is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.

(d) Equitable Relief. NOTHING IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA, DATA SECURITY, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT, PROVIDED THAT YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.

(e) Severability. If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Section 20.3 (Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver) is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

##### 25.3 **Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**

BY ENTERING INTO THESE WORKPLACE ToS, YOU AND WHEN I WORK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO BOTH NATUAL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS. YOU AND WHEN I WORK AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT INDIVIDUAL USERS.

#### **26\. GENERAL**

##### 26.1 **U.S. Government Restricted Rights**.

To the extent the Service is being used by or on behalf of the U.S. Government, the Service will be deemed commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation (as applicable). Accordingly, if you are an agency of the U.S. Government or any contractor therefor, you receive only those rights with respect to the Service as are granted hereunder, in accordance with 48 C.F.R. §227.7202 and 48 C.F.R. §12.212, as applicable.

##### 26.2 **Assignment**.

These Workplace ToS, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by When I Work without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

##### 26.3 **Notification Procedures and Changes to the Workplace ToS**.

When I Work may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by When I Work in our sole discretion. When I Work reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to a Workplace, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Workplace ToS. We are not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. When I Work may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Workplace ToS, including any Schedules attached hereto and/or incorporated herein by reference, from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Workplace ToS in a material manner, we will provide reasonable notice to you and update the “last modified” date at the bottom of this webpage. These Workplace ToS applies to and governs your access to and use of the Service effective as of the start of your access to the Service, even if such access began before publication of these Workplace ToS. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to current Workplace ToS or any updates to them, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

##### 26.4 **Entire Agreement/Severability**.

These Workplace ToS, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with When I Work in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and When I Work concerning the Service. If any provision of these Workplace ToS is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Workplace ToS, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable. The terms and conditions of any Purchase Order issued with respect to this purchase are superseded by this Agreement, including the Privacy Policy.

##### 26.5   **Force Majeure**.

Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform its obligations hereunder (other than for the payment of amounts due) if such delay or failure arises from any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, including acts of God, floods, fires, pandemic, or loss of electricity or other utilities.

##### 26.6 **No Waiver**.

No waiver of any right or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such right or provision or any other right or provision, and When I Work’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Before you may access and use the Payroll Services or its underlying platform, WIW, through its Third-Party Service Providers, will use a variety of processes to validate your business’ identity, perform a credit analysis, and otherwise qualify you to be a Payroll Services subscriber.

(b) WIW’s use of Third-Party Service Providers. WIW’s Payroll Services are powered by Check Technologies, Inc. (“**Check**”), a Third-Party Service Provider who manages calculations, payments, and tax filings. Check requires that before you and your Users use Payroll Services, each must agree to the following:

* Customer and its Users: [**Check’s Terms of Service**](https://www.checkhq.com/terms), including [**Check’s Privacy Policy**](https://www.checkhq.com/privacy);
* For Customer, as the Workplace: Check’s [**Payroll User Service Terms**](https://www.checkhq.com/employerterms); and
* For Customers and Users who wish to connect their bank accounts to Check: All who wish to connect their bank accounts to Check, such as Users wanting to utilize direct deposit, must agree to: (i) Check’s use of the financial services company, Plaid, to connect to the applicable bank account to Check; and (ii) allow Plaid to process Customer and User data in accordance with [**Plaid’s Privacy Policy**](https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy).  
      
    (collectively, “**Check-Related Agreements**”  
      
    Check and WIW are separate business entities, and the terms of the Check-Related Agreements govern the use of Payroll Services in addition to those set forth in this Agreement. **Please read all Check-Related Agreements** as they will control to the extent that there is a conflict between this Agreement and the Check-Related Agreements.  
      
    Check uses the information you provide through the WIW Service to calculate and pay Customer’s payroll, pay Customer’s payroll taxes to applicable taxing agencies, produce payroll tax returns and W-2 statements, and, if applicable, remit wage garnishments, such as child support payments, to the applicable collecting entity, agency, or person. To facilitate payroll payments on behalf of WIW Customers to their Users, and to facilitate associated payments to taxing authorities, Check may maintain custodial accounts with one or more banks (each, the “**Bank**”).

(c) Information Needed to Create a Payroll Account; Qualification Process. Providing and receiving Payroll Services requires compliance with various laws, regulations, and rules, including the NACHA Operating Rules for ACH (collectively, all such laws, regulations, and rules, the “**Compliance Requirements**”); therefore, you agree to provide to WIW and its Third-Service Providers all information requested to satisfy the Compliance Requirements.  
  
**When registering for a Payroll Account, the information you provide must be complete and accurate and you agree to promptly update this information if it changes.** You give us and our Third-Party Service Providers permission to obtain, verify, and record this information to satisfy all due diligence obligations under applicable Compliance Requirements. WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers retain full authority and discretion to grant or decline your use of the Payroll Services for any reason. **WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers are not liable for any errors or inaccuracies in information you provided**.  
  
**During the qualification period, prior to your initial payroll processing date, you are responsible for: (i) remitting any federal, state, and local withholding liabilities and other payroll liabilities incurred prior to enrolling in the Payroll Services; and (ii) submitting any payroll returns to tax agencies that were due for payroll tax liabilities incurred before using the Payroll Services**.  
  
You may also be required to provide additional information, accept other required terms, complete, and sign additional forms, and respond to inquiries from us (or our Third-Party Service Providers) as part of the qualification processes. Your failure to respond fully, promptly, and accurately may result in your immediate suspension or termination from the Payroll Services.  
  
In the event you are not approved to be a Payroll Services subscriber, we will refund any unused pre-paid Payroll Services fees, less any costs incurred by WIW (_e.g._ transactional fees) for the qualification process.

#### 2\. **CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS FOR CONTINUED ACCESS AND USE OF PAYROLL SERVICES**

(a) Information Needed to Maintain a Payroll Account. Once you are initially qualified and enrolled in Payroll Services, WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers will monitor your qualifications throughout your Payroll Services subscription term. From time to time, we may require you to agree to additional or updated terms and complete and sign additional forms due to changes in Compliance Requirements. We reserve the right to terminate Payroll Services to you if any information or inquiry from us remains unanswered for more than thirty (30) days.

(b) Provision of Payroll Information. You are fully responsible for:

* Inviting your employees and other shift workers to onboard with Payroll Services, having each review and agree to the User Payroll Terms of Service, and having each create Payroll User Accounts to receive the benefit of WIW’s Payroll Services.  
      
    **NOTE: Payroll Services  are currently available only to Workplaces in the United States and to Users who are either (a)employees of Customer who receive from you a W-2, federal wage and tax statement; or (b) independent contractors at your Workplace who receive from you a 1099-NEC or a 1099-MISC for reporting nonemployee compensation**.  
      
      
    
* Making available sufficient funds to cover all disbursements, fees, payroll taxes, or any other amounts due under this Agreement; and
* Reviewing and verifying the completeness and accuracy of Payroll Information (as defined below) before it is submitted to the WIW Service. The integrity and accuracy of the Payroll Services is limited by the nature of information you provide. WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers rely on you providing complete and accurate data, content, and other materials, including Payroll Information, into the Payroll Service. Your submission of Payroll Information is your authorization for WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers to create and transmit the entries necessary to process your payroll and payroll tax transactions using that information.  
      
    “**Payroll Information**” means any information provided to either WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers through the Payroll Service that is necessary for our provision of the Payroll Service, including but not limited to information to calculate payroll, such as wage and salary information, hours worked, location of hours worked, bank information, information related to payroll tax obligations (such as your employer identification number), unemployment insurance tax rates, payroll schedule, federal and state tax information, local powers of attorney (if necessary), and, if applicable, paid-time off information, employee benefit information, wage garnishment information, and any other information provided by you and necessary for our provision of the Payroll Service.  
      
    Payroll Information, User Data (defined in subsection (c) immediately below) and any other data, content, and other materials specifically pertaining to you or your Users that are submitted into or transmitted through the Service in connection with this Agreement is collectively referred to as “**Payroll Services Data**”.  
    

(c) Consents and Authorizations.

* Data. You hereby authorize WIW to disclose to its Third-Party Service Providers, including Check, your Payroll Services Data in connection with this Agreement and you further authorize Check to disclose this Payroll Services Data to the Bank. All Payroll Services Data shall be accurate, complete, and promptly updated as necessary.  
      
    For any Payroll Services Data specific to your Users that is submitted into the Service in connection with this Agreement, including roles, employment status, employment duration, time & attendance, wage and salary information, and other information specified by WIW from time to time (collectively “**User Data**”), you must ensure that your Users have authorized you to disclose their User Data to WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers, including Check, and that your Users have authorized Check to disclose User Data to Bank. The provision of Payroll Services is dependent on you timely obtaining and maintaining these authorizations.  
      
    By providing Payroll Services Data to WIW, you hereby grant WIW and its affiliated companies a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid, transferable, sublicensable, license to copy, display, upload, perform, distribute, publish, store, modify, translate, create derivative works from, and otherwise use your Payroll Services Data to provide the Payroll Services and interoperability with the offerings of Third-Party Service Providers, including, without limitation, as set forth in this Agreement.  
    
* Bank Account. In order for WIW, through its Third-Party Service Providers, to provide you with the Payroll Services, you must successfully connect your business checking account (“**Company Bank Account**”) as explained in the on-boarding instructions and you agree to maintain in your Company Bank Account available funds sufficient to cover all disbursements, fees, payroll taxes, or any other amounts due under this Agreement.  
      
    You authorize WIW, through its Third-Party Service Providers, to debit and/or credit your Company Bank Account, from time to time as necessary, to process entries in the amounts and on the days required for WIW, through its Third-Party Service Providers, to provide Payroll Services on your behalf. The provision of Payroll Services is dependent on you timely obtaining and maintaining these authorizations. These authorizations will remain in full force and effect until Customer provides WIW with written notice of termination of any such authorizations in such time and such manner as to afford WIW, its Third-Party Service Providers, and the Bank a reasonable opportunity to act upon such notice.

(d) Effect of Errors Due to Provision of Inaccurate or Untimely Payroll Services Data. You agree and acknowledge WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers rely on information furnished by you and your Users to perform the Payroll Services. **WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers are not liable for any errors or inaccuracies in Payroll Services Data you or your Users provided.** If any errors result, whether directly or indirectly, from WIW’s or its Third-Party Service Providers’ reliance on: (i) Payroll Services Data, whether provided by you or your Users; (ii) changes to Payroll Services Data; or (iii) requests to WIW to change Payroll Services Data, WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers may elect to attempt to correct these errors, but neither WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers make any warranties or guarantees as to the timing of such corrections or that such errors will be able to partially or fully corrected.  
  
If interest or penalties result from such errors, you are responsible for the interest or penalties, and you acknowledge that neither WIW nor its Third-Party Service Providers are responsible for these liabilities.  
  
WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers reserve the right to require written authorization for any corrections or amendments, to charge additional fees for any error corrections or form amendments, or to refuse to affect such corrections or amendments.  
  
Likewise, if Payroll Services Data is not submitted by your applicable submission date or  applicable cut-off time, WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers may elect to attempt to expedite the processing of your payroll but neither WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers make any warranties or guarantees in this regard and may process that Payroll Services Data and transmit the credit or debit entries to the ACH as part of the next regularly-scheduled file we create. WIW reserves the right to charge additional fees for the service of expediting your payroll.  

(e) Effect of Errors Due to Insufficient Bank Account Funds. Neither WIW nor Check is obligated to perform the Payroll Services including, without limitation, facilitating the Bank’s payment of wages or taxes or the preparation or filing of tax returns if you have not timely remitted to Bank the funds for wages and tax payments or you have insufficient funds in your Company Bank Account.  
  
We will not be liable for any consequences or claims directly or indirectly arising from your failure to make sufficient funds available to pay all disbursements, fees, payroll taxes, or any other amounts to be paid by you due under these Payroll ToS.  

(f) Effect of Errors Attributable Solely to WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers; Disclaimers. If any tax filing errors result that are attributable solely to WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers – _e.g._ due to operational issues with the Payroll Services; WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers misses tax compliance changes;  or, we fail to deposit or remit your withholding taxes when due and the failure is not caused by you– then provided you use reasonable efforts to mitigate any penalties or losses resulting from such errors and you promptly notify us of any notices from the Internal Revenue Service or other government agencies regarding penalties or errors, we agree as follows:

* We will pay (or reimburse you for) any penalties and interest assessed by the taxing authority(ies); and/or
* We will pay (or reimburse you for) any corrections or amendments needed due to missed tax compliance changes.  
      
    The foregoing is your sole remedy and WIW’s (and its Third-Party Service Providers’) sole liability to you.  
      
    **EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS SUBSECTION (f), THE PAYROLL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”** **AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WIW DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, CONTRACTUAL OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT. WIW DOES NOT WARRANT THAT USE OF THE PAYROLLL SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT THE OPERATION AND OUTPUT OF THE PAYROLL SERVICES WILL BE ERROR FREE OR COMPLETE**.  
    

(g) Cooperation in Investigations. You agree to cooperate with us in investigating any fraudulent or illegal transactions.

(h) Specifying a Payroll Account Administrator. As a Workplace, you will be required to designate certain individuals who are authorized to provide information, take certain actions, and enter into agreements on your behalf (each a “**Payroll Account Administrator**” or “**Authorized Representative**”), including but not limited to the ability to review, submit, amend, or cancel payrolls (each, a “**Payroll Entry**”). We will use reasonable efforts to verify, but do not guarantee, that anyone who submits a Payroll Entry is a Payroll Account Administrator authorized to take such action.  
  
You will require each Payroll Account Administrator and Authorized Representative to maintain a unique log-in.  

(i) Responsibility for Actions taken under your Payroll Account. You are solely responsible for actions taken under your Payroll Account. Any actions taken under your Payroll Account will be deemed authorized by you, regardless of your knowledge of such actions (the “**Authorized Actions**”). Authorized Actions include but are not limited to: (i) actions taken by a Payroll Account Administrator or other Authorized Representative; and (ii) actions that a Payroll Account Administrator or an Authorized Representative (or anyone that we reasonably believe to be a Payroll Account Administrator or an Authorized Representative) directs or instructs us to take on its behalf.  
  
To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that if one of your Payroll Account Administrators or Authorized Representatives provides us with accurate login or identity verification credentials and authorizes us to take actions on your behalf (_e.g._ clicking the “Submit Payroll” or other buttons; or you verbally instruct a WIW representative to take an action), such actions will have the same effect as if you provided us with written signature authorizing us to make any electronic payments, filings, or take any other actions as it relates to the Payroll Service on your behalf.  

(j) Responsibility for Compliance with Laws. In providing Payroll Services, neither WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers are acting in a fiduciary capacity for you, and you acknowledge the following:

* You should not construe any information provided directly or indirectly through your use of the Payroll Services to be legal, tax, or accounting advice;
* The Payroll Services may not include all functions necessary to operate your business or to meet all federal, state, and local payroll reporting obligations applicable to you;
* Although WIW and/or its Third-Party Service Providers may be authorized by you to act as your reporting agent with applicable tax authorities, this authorization does not relieve you of your responsibility to (or from liability for failing to) ensure that all tax returns, tax deposits, and payments are filed and made on a timely basis in accordance with applicable laws;
* You, as the Workplace, are solely responsible and assume all liability for complying with applicable federal, state, and local wage and hour laws, including those laws related to employee classification (_e.g._ employee vs independent contractor), minimum wage laws, wage deduction laws, meal period and rest break premiums, regular rate of pay calculations, overtime calculations and payments, paid sick leave accrual, itemization and issuance of pay statements, and laws pertaining to the timing of pay (including final pay); and
* WIW and its Third-Party Service Providers act only as intermediaries between you and your Users specifically and solely with respect to the delivery of payroll funds owed.

(k) Fees.

* Base Payroll Services Fees. Payroll Services are licensed on a subscription basis with fees charged based on (A) the total number of Customer’s Users per month enrolled in Payroll Services for any portion of a month (“**Base Fee**”); plus (B) each User for which Customer uses the Payroll Services for any portion of a month (“**Per User Fee**”). The Payroll Services subscription may be purchased by you [online](https://wheniwork.com/pricing) or by executing a WIW-issued quote or other type of WIW-approved order form. Unless WIW has agreed to provide you with a no-charge subscription to Payroll Services, Customer will pay to WIW the applicable Payroll Services fees per the terms of the Workplace ToS or per the payment terms as set forth in the Customer’s executed WIW-issued quote or other type of WIW-approved order form.  
      
    Unlike WIW’s scheduling and time and attendance subscriptions, which are payable monthly or annually in advance at the start of each month-to-month or annual Subscription Term, as applicable, Payroll Services Base Fee and Per User Fee are paid monthly in arrears.  
      
    Payroll Services fees are not prorated for partial month’s use and Customer will be charged a full month of fees for any portion of a month Customer uses the Payroll Services.  
      
      
    
* Pass-Through Fees. Customer hereby agrees and acknowledges that WIW may charge certain fees and expenses (“**Pass-Through Fees**”) from time to time for certain “**Payroll Service Events**”, such as untimely tax filing where the delay is due to no fault of WIW or its Third-Party Service Providers. A schedule of Payroll Service Events and the Pass-Through Fees for each is posted in our Help Center’s [Payroll Billing Reference Guide](https://help.wheniwork.com/articles/payroll-billing-reference-guide/). Pass-Through Fees will be invoiced in arrears at least quarterly, and the amount of the Pass-Through Fees invoiced will be based on the type and number of Payroll Service Events that transpired.  
      
    WIW and its Third-Party Service Provides may modify or amend the Pass-Through Fees and/or add additional events triggering Pass-Through Fees from time-to-time with an effective date of no-less than 15 days after such updates are communicated to Customer via email, posted on the website, or the Service itself.  
      
    With respect to the fees designated as Pass-Through Fees, Partner’s use of the Services after the effective date of the updated schedule shall be deemed acknowledgment by Customer and acceptance of the changes to the Pass-Through Fees in the Pricing Schedule and the effective date of such changes.  
    

(l) Additional Obligations.

* You are and shall be responsible for addressing any complaints from Users, tax authorities, and other payees and you are and shall be liable for paying any expenses, losses, fines, penalties, or damages to its Users, tax authorities, or other payees that arise out of or relate to any errors or omissions in the Payroll Services Data provided by you or your Users or that arise out of or relate to your insufficient funds.
* You must Inform Users of any relevant policies and practices of yours and any settings you select that may impact the processing of Payroll Services Data.
* Additional obligations of yours and your Users related to the provision of Payroll Services are detailed in the Check-Related Agreements addressed in Section 1(b) of these Payroll ToS. **Please read all terms in the Check-Related Agreements**.

Check and/or WIW may terminate your access to the business insurance platform for any reason, including by way of example, because a federal or state government agency or office notifies Check (and/or WIW) that any aspect of the business insurance services may or does violate any applicable law or regulation.  In such an event, you will be given advanced notice as the circumstances allow, as determined solely by Check or WIW. 

If Check terminates its relationship with NEXT, it may substitute access to an alternative business insurance platform and business insurance services. WIW will endeavor to provide advanced notice of such an event. 

**If access to the business insurance platform is terminated by WIW or Check, your sole remedy and WIW’s sole liability and responsibility to you is for WIW to provide reasonable assistance in offboarding your Workplace (and Users) from the NEXT business insurance platform.**

The NEXT-Related Agreements address termination/cancellation rights and obligations between you and NEXT related to the business insurance services.

The provisions of this Workers’ Comp Insurance Schedule that should, by their nature survive termination and/or expiration, shall and do survive such termination and/or expiration.

Features may vary by the plan selected, by Workplace, and by the type of access privileges and roles (Admin, Supervisor, Manager, or Employee) a User is assigned in the Service by the Workplace.

##### 1.3 **Payroll Services and On-Demand Pay**

(a) Payroll. If your Workplace licenses payroll processing and management services (“**Payroll Services**”), which are powered by our Third-Party Service Provider, Check Technologies, through WIW as an additional service in connection with the Service, then the following applies:  
  
In addition to these User ToS, your creation of a Payroll User Account and the access and use of the Payroll Services are subject to the [**Payroll User Terms of Service**](#h-payroll-user-terms-of-service-payroll-user-tos) (“**Payroll User ToS**”), attached as Schedule B and incorporated herein by reference.

This feature is available at no cost to U.S.-based Workplaces that license the Time & Attendance feature of the Service and that opt-in to ODP  
  
**Terms specific to WIW’s On-Demand Pay provider, Clair**:

* To provide ODP, WIW must share certain data with Clair and Clair’s third-party service providers (such as its banking services provider). Therefore, if you use the OPD feature, you authorize When I Work to use and to share with Clair and Clair’s third-party service providers information about you as a User associated with your Workplace, such as number of hours worked, hourly rate, and information regarding paid and unpaid breaks.
* Users who choose to access and use ODP must each separately agree to be bound to separate terms, including Clair’s Privacy Policy, all of which may be found at [**Clair Legal Information**](https://getclair.com/legal).

* When you register as a User, the personal profile you create within your User Account (referred to as a “**User Profile**”) allows you to set a profile image, set your personal information, and configure your preferences. (_See Section 3 below for further information_).
* By connecting When I Work with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.
* You may never use another User’s account without permission.
* When registering as a User, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date.
* If the settings are enabled by your Workplace, the Time & Attendance features of the Service require that your geolocation information be provided to the Service, such as for clock ins and clock outs via a personal computer (by checking your web browser’s geolocation or the IP address of the internet connection) or via the mobile app installed on your device (using the GPS signal on your device). Your Workplace determines how close Users must be to their scheduled location to clock in or clock out.  
      
    If your Workplace uses the location-based restrictions in the Time & Attendance feature, you acknowledge and agree that your geolocation information may be obtained by the Service and your geolocation may be provided to your Workplace when you clock in and clock out. You also acknowledge and agree that your geolocation information may be used for safety and security purposes.

#### **3\. User Content**

Some areas of the Service allow Users to post or provide content such as profile information, images, audio, comments, questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service is referred to as “**User Content**”). WIW claims no ownership rights over User Content created by you. The User Content you create, including your User Profile, remains yours; however, by providing or sharing User Content through the Service, you agree as follows:

* Your User Content plus any other information, records, and files that you provide, submit, post, display, or otherwise make available to or through the Service becomes “**Customer Data**” and you acknowledge and agree that the Customer Data is owned and controlled by our Customer (your Workplace). Your Workplace has many choices over that Customer Data. For example, your Workplace may enable or disable the integrations with Third-Party Services, manage access privileges and User roles, and request that WIW share information regarding its Users with a third party, and these choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification, or deletion of certain or all Customer Data.

**AS BETWEEN WIW AND YOUR WORKPLACE, YOU AGREE THAT IT IS SOLELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUR WORKPLACE  TO (A) INFORM YOU AND OTHER USERS OF ANY RELEVANT WORKPLACE POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND ANY SETTINGS IN THE SERVICE THAT MAY IMPACT THE PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA; (B) PROVIDE ANY NOTICES AND OBTAIN ANY RIGHTS, PERMISSIONS OR CONSENTS FROM YOU AND OTHER USERS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE LAWFUL USE OF CUSTOMER DATA, INCLUDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (****_a/k/a_** **PERSONAL DATA), AND THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE; (C) ENSURE THAT THE TRANSFER AND PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA UNDER THE AGREEMENT IS LAWFUL; AND (D) RESPOND TO AND RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER USERS RELATING TO OR BASED ON CUSTOMER DATA.

* Your User Content does not and will not include any “protected health information” subject to the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act of 1996, P.L. 104-191, together with any implementing regulations, as amended from time to time (collectively, “**HIPAA**”). When I Work shall not be liable for breaches of HIPAA or failures to comply with this restriction by you, your Workplace, or other users associated with your Workplace’s account;
* Your User Content does not and will not contain any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, obscene, or otherwise objectionable or illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets or other proprietary information);

When I Work reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that When I Work believes, in its sole discretion, violates any of these provisions or is otherwise objectionable. Whether notice is provided to you or your Workplace in advance depends on the severity of the circumstances as determined solely by WIW. **It is your responsibility to maintain appropriate alternate backup of all Your User Content**.

When I Work takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third-party posts, sends, or otherwise makes available over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing, sharing, or otherwise making such User Content available on the Service, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content.

You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.

For the purposes of these User ToS, “**Intellectual Property Rights**” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory, or other jurisdiction.

#### **15\. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**

##### 15.1 **Governing Law**.

You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Minnesota; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Minnesota. These User ToS shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Minnesota, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these User ToS evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws (and law of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted applicable law. If the FAA is found not to apply, any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the laws of the U.S. state where you live, or the jurisdiction mutually agreed in writing by you and us. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Hennepin County, Minnesota for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our data security, confidential information, or Intellectual Property Rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Hennepin County, Minnesota is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable. These User ToS were drafted in the English language and this English language version of these User ToS is the original, governing instrument of the understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between the English version of these User ToS and any translation, the English version will prevail.

##### 15.2 **Arbitration**

(a) General. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WHEN I WORK. This Section 17(B) (the “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (1) these User ToS, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (2) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (3) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (4) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a User or consumer (each, a “Claim,” and, collectively, “Claims”). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these User ToS.

(b) Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement. If you are a new User, you can reject and opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these User ToS by emailing us at [support@wheniwork.com](mailto:support@wheniwork.com) with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these User ToS, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.

(c) Dispute Resolution Process. For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at [support@wheniwork.com](mailto:support@wheniwork.com) and attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that When I Work has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim by binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/), where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. County where you live or Hennepin County, Minnesota, unless you and When I Work agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (1) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (2) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (3) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these User ToS are, or whether any provision of these User ToS is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.

(d) Equitable Relief. NOTHING IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT, PROVIDED THAT YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.

(e) Severability. If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Section 16.3 (Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver) is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

##### 15.3 **Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**

BY ENTERING INTO THESE USER ToS, YOU AND WHEN I WORK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO ALL USERS (BOTH NATUAL PERSONS AND ENTITIES), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS. YOU AND WHEN I WORK AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.

#### **16\. General**

##### 16.1 **Beta Program Participation**.

From time-to-time, we may offer Workplaces and Users early access to and use of new or modified services, features, or functions within the Service (“**Beta Program**”). You may choose to participate in a Beta Program in your sole discretion. It will be made available to you at no charge in exchange for feedback and reports regarding the performance and quality of the new or modified services, features, or functions being offered. WIW may discontinue a Beta Program at any time in its sole discretion and may never make it generally available. Beta Programs are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. WIW will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with a Beta Program.

##### 16.2 **Notification Procedures and Changes to the User ToS**.

When I Work may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by When I Work in our sole discretion. When I Work reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these User ToS. We are not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.

These User ToS apply to and governs your access to and use of the Service effective as of the start of your access to the Service, even if such access began before publication of these User ToS. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the updated User ToS. If you do not agree to the current User ToS or updates to them, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

##### 16.3 **Entire Agreement/Severability**.

These User ToS, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with When I Work in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and When I Work concerning the Service. If any provision of these User ToS is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these User ToS, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.

##### 16.4 **Force Majeure**.

Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform its obligations hereunder (other than for the payment of amounts due) if such delay or failure arises from any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, including acts of God, floods, fires, pandemic, or loss of electricity or other utilities.

##### 16.5 **No Waiver**.

No waiver of any right or provision of these User ToS shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such right or provision or any other right or provision. When I Work’s failure to assert any right or provision under these User ToS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

##### 16.6 **No Professional Advice**.

If the Service or any Third-Party Service provides professional information (for example, medical, legal, or financial), such information is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional advice. No action should be taken based upon any information contained in the Service. You should seek independent professional advice from a person who is licensed and/or qualified in the applicable area.
