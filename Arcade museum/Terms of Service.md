By accessing this web site, you are agreeing to be bound by these web site Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms of Use") and Privacy Policy, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.

If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. By accepting this agreement, you agree that this Terms of Use Agreement and Privacy Policy will apply whenever you use our sites or services.

    You agree to hold harmless and indemnify WebMagic, and its officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, suppliers, employees, advertisers, licensors and partners, from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to your use of WebMagic services, violation of the Terms, violation of any law or the rights of a third party, or any other actions in connection with use of WebMagic services; including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorney's fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case, WebMagic will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action.
    
22. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES**
    
    YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT:
    
    1. YOUR USE OF WEBMAGIC SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. WEBMAGIC SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WEBMAGIC AND ITS PARTNERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND NEGATE ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND THE OBTAINMENT OF TALENT AND OTHER RIGHTS CLEARANCES FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    2. WEBMAGIC AND ITS PARTNERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT (i) WEBMAGIC SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (ii) WEBMAGIC SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (iii) THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF WEBMAGIC SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, (iv) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH WEBMAGICSERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS, AND (V) ANY ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED.
    3. ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF WEBMAGIC SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.
    4. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM WEBMAGIC OR THROUGH OR FROM WEBMAGIC SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS.
    
23. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**
    
    YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WEBMAGIC AND ITS PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF WEBMAGIC OR PARTNERS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED ORALLY OR IN WRITING OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES) RESULTING FROM: (i) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE WEBMAGIC SERVICES; (ii) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM WEBMAGIC SERVICES; (iii) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (iv) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON WEBMAGIC SERVICES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONTENT, POSTS, ACTIONS OR INACTIONS, OR ITEMS OR SERVICES LIST AS FOR SALE OR WANTED; OR (v) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO WEBMAGIC SERVICES.
    
    We cannot guarantee continuous or secure access to our sites, services, or tools, and operation of our sites, services or tools may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. Accordingly, to the extent legally permitted, we exclude all implied warranties, terms and conditions. We are not liable for any loss of money, goodwill or reputation, or any special, indirect or consequential damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of your use of or your inability to use our sites, services, and tools.
    
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.
    
    Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited by the greater of (a) the total fees you paid us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, (b) the total fees paid by you to WebMagic directly related to the specific instance of service associated with or to the liability, or (c) One Hundred Dollars (US$100).
    
    THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
    
24. **EXCLUSIONS**
    
    NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO EXCLUDE OR LIMIT ANY CONDITION, WARRANTY, RIGHT OR LIABILITY WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF IMPLIED TERMS, OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, ONLY THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ABOVE WHICH ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
    
25. **NO AGENCY**
    
    No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.
    
26. **NOTICES**
    
    Except as explicitly stated otherwise, legal notices shall be served on WebMagic's national registered agent (in the case of WebMagic) or to the email address you provide to WebMagic during the registration process (in your case). Notice shall be deemed given 24 hours after email is sent, unless the sending party is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to the address provided during the registration process. In such case, notice shall be deemed given three days after the date of mailing.
    
27. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT**
    
    The Terms (including any policies, licenses, guidelines or amendments that may be presented to your form time to time) constitute the complete and exclusive agreement regarding the subject matter hereof between you and WebMagic and govern your use of WebMagic services, superseding any prior agreements between you and WebMagic for the use of WebMagic services. Any and all previous representations, discussions and writings are merged and superseded by this agreement. This agreement may be modified only by a written document signed by all the parties hereto. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other WebMagic and/or third-party content, services, or software.
    
28. **HEADINGS**
    
    Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such section.
    
29. **WAIVER**
    
    WebMagic's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We do not guarantee we will take action against all breaches of this Agreement.
    
30. **SEVERABILITY**
    
    If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
    
31. **AGREED STATUE OF LIMITATIONS**
    
    You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of WebMagic services or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
    
32. **GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION**
    
    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of laws provision. The parties hereto agree that any action, suit or other legal proceeding involving any differences, controversies or other disputes in any way related to or arising out of this Agreement or related to any matter concerning our web sites or other services shall be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, or the California state court for the County of Los Angeles, and the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any such action, suit or other legal proceeding.
