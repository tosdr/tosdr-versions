TAXBIT, INC.

TERMS OF SERVICE

Thank you for using TaxBit to calculate, track, and populate your tax forms. These terms of service (“Terms”) cover your use and access to our services, software, and websites (“Services”). Your agreement is with TaxBit, Inc. (“TaxBit”, “we” or “us”). By using our Services, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms. If you do not understand or agree to these Terms, please do not use our Services.

For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services. If you are using our Services for an organization, then “you” includes you and that organization, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the organization with authority to bind the organization to these Terms, and (b) you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization.

**Section 14 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver. By agreeing to these Terms, you agree (a) to resolve all disputes with us related to the Services through binding individual arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and (b) to waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative actions in connection with your use of the Services. You have the right to opt-out of arbitration as explained in Section 14.**

Who May Use The Services
------------------------

You must be 18 years of age or older and reside in the United States or any of its territories to use the Services. Individuals under the age of 18 are not permitted to use the Services.  By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.

User Accounts; Your Responsibilities
------------------------------------

To use certain of our Services, you need to create an account (“Account”).  You agree to provide us with accurate, complete and updated information for your Account. Keep your information protected by safeguarding your password to your Account. Make sure to keep your Account information current. Do not share your Account credentials or give others access to your Account. We are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account. You must immediately notify us if you know or have any reason to suspect that your Account or password have been stolen, misappropriated or otherwise compromised, or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Account. You agree not to create any Account if we have previously removed your, or we previously banned you from any of our Services, unless we provide written consent otherwise.

Further, you agree that your use of TaxBit's Consumer platform is for your individual or sole proprietor use only and you will be permitted as many transactions as you reasonably need. We reserve the right to monitor account volumes and reach out to request confirmation that such transactions do not go beyond your personal use. If your Consumer account has over 10 million USD worth of assets under management and/or over 100,000 transactions then we may presume that the account is being used for more than just personal use. We reserve the right to reach out to you to transition to an Enterprise plan and failure to respond or do so may result in termination of your Consumer account.

Subscriptions
-------------

_Billing_. If you buy or subscribe to any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes in U.S. Dollars. Failure to pay these fees and taxes will result in the termination of your access to the paid Services.. You agree that (a) if you purchase a recurring subscription to any of the Service, we may store and may automatically continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) from the date you purchase such subscription Services and on each periodic renewal until cancellation to avoid interruption of such Services, and (b) you are responsible for all applicable taxes, and we may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase and charge tax when required to do so. All subscriptions are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the subscription becomes payable. Payment can be made by credit card, debit card, or other means that we may make available. Subscriptions will not be processed until payment has been received in full, and any holds on your account by any other payment processor are solely your responsibility. Discounts are only effective for the current calendar year. Customer subscriptions between January 1st to April 15th include IRS 8949 form generation for the current tax year (and all prior years if Plus or Pro plan) but do not include the following year's tax form without renewal.

_Subscription Renewals and Cancellations_.  You agree that if you purchase a subscription, your subscription will automatically renew at the subscription period frequency referenced on your subscription page (or if not designated, then monthly) and at the then-current rates, and your payment method will automatically be charged at the start of each new subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period.  To avoid future subscription charges, you must cancel your subscription before the subscription period renewal date by doing the following: You may cancel your subscription within your TaxBit account.

_TaxBit Network_. The TaxBit Network is a network of cryptocurrency exchanges that TaxBit supports to allow users on in-network exchanges to receive completed IRS 8949 and IRS Income tax forms at no charge. The TaxBit Network allows you to (1) connect in-network and other exchange accounts, (2) view tax computations related to in-network transactions, including cost basis assignment relating to deposits onto in-network platforms from other platforms, and (3) obtain IRS 8949 and Income tax forms (if applicable) for in-network cryptocurrency activity (“Services”). You may have to purchase a subscription to purchase additional features or to receive tax forms for out-of-network exchanges. You further acknowledge that TaxBit is a third party service and companies included in the TaxBit Network aren't liable for the services provided by TaxBit.

_Changes_. We reserve the right to change our subscription plans or adjust pricing for the Services in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, any price changes or changes to your subscription plan will take effect following reasonable notice to you..

_No Subscription Refunds_. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, payments for any subscriptions to the Services are nonrefundable and there are no credits for partially used periods. Following any cancellation by you, however, you will continue to have access to the paid Services through the end of the subscription period for which payment has already been made.

Third Party Services and Materials
----------------------------------

Certain Services may display, use,  include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party websites. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that TaxBit is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, availability, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or websites.

Third Party Materials may include third party Application Programming Interfaces (“API’s”). TaxBit will use the API’s to provide the Services, such as for tracking and calculating taxes. You hereby grant us, our affiliates and third parties we work with a right to access and use API’s in connection with the Services. TaxBit encourages users to use only "read-only" API keys. These features require our system to access, use, and store your information. You acknowledge and agree that your usage of our Services provides us permission to conduct these activities, and this permission extends to our affiliates and third parties we work with.

Termination
-----------

You are free to stop using our Services at any time. If you breach any of the provisions of these Terms, all licenses granted by TaxBit will terminate automatically. Additionally, we reserve the right to suspend, disable or terminate your access to the Services and/or your Account (or any part of the foregoing), with or without notice, for any or no reason. If TaxBit deletes your Account for any suspected breach of these Terms by you, you are prohibited from re-registering for the Services under a different name. In the event of Account deletion for any reason, TaxBit may, but is not obligated to, delete any of Your Content. TaxBit shall not be responsible for the failure to delete or deletion of Your Content. All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms by TaxBit or you. Termination will not limit any of TaxBit’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity

Services Are “As Is”
--------------------

To the fullest extent permitted by law, TaxBit and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, REFERRAL PARTNERS, partners, licensors, suppliers and distributors (the “TaxBit Entities”) make no warranties or representations, either express or implied, about the Services. Your access to and use of the Services are at your own risk. The Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. TaxBit Entities also disclaim all warranties and conditions (express or implied) of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The TaxBit Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (a) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services; (b) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services; (c) the operation or compatibility with any other application or any particular system or device; (d) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure or error-free basis; and (e) the deletion of, or the failure to store or transmit, Your Content and other communications maintained by the Services. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from TaxBit Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein (including but not limited to with respect to any advice or information regarding a user’s estimated tax liability for cryptocurrency transactions). It is recommended that users use a Certified Public Accountant to review their entire tax liability. TaxBit is not liable for inaccurate tax calculations, estimates, or audits. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy of their data and corresponding tax documents and to ensure all of their transactions are uploaded to the Services prior to exporting their tax form.

Tax calculations rely on the data that is being provided. It is your responsibility to ensure that all of your trading data is populated into your account and no duplicates are present. Exchanges sometimes make updates to their API's that can change the transactional data in your Account. You should verify your data and reach out to our support team if there are any issues. After verifying your data and downloading your tax forms you are encouraged to "lock" your accounting period so that locked data does not move and reconciles back to your tax forms.

### THE TAXBIT ENTITIES TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

To the extent permitted by law, you agree that the TaxBit Entities will not  be liable for:

* Damages of any kind, including any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages;
    
* Any loss of use, data, business, or profits;
    
* Any failures in the software included within the Services, including but not limited to miscalculations, duplicate data, failure to bring in data from an API, and other errors; or
    
* or ANY OTHER CLAIM, DEMAND OR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE DELIVERY, USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES.
    

In each case of the foregoing, however caused and under any theory of liability, WHETHER UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE ARISING IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) EVEN IF THE TAXBIT ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS (SUCH AS THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY)  DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE TAXBIT ENTITIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES FINALLY AWARDED SHALL NOT EXCEED the greater of $20 USD or 100% of any amount you have paid under your current service plan with TaxBit. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

IF YOU HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO USE THE SERVICE BY A THIRD PARTY REFERRING PARTNER OR OTHER THIRD PARTY (SUCH AS A TAX PROFESSIONAL), YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH THIRD PARTY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICES.

Further, you acknowledge that TaxBit's customer support agents do not give tax advice. TaxBit's support team is here to help explain our Services. You agree to not rely on any support communications as investment, legal, or tax advice. You hereby disclaim any claim against the company relating to communications from our support team.

Indemnification
---------------

By entering into these Terms and accessing or using the Services, you agree that you shall defend, indemnify and hold the TaxBit Entities harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by the TaxBit Entities arising out of or in connection with: (a) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation; (b) your violation of any rights of any third party; (c) your misuse of the Services; (d) Your Content, or (e) your negligence or willful misconduct. If you are obligated to indemnify any TaxBit Entity hereunder, then you agree that TaxBit (or, at its discretion, the applicable TaxBit Entity) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether TaxBit wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you agree to fully cooperate with TaxBit in the defense or settlement of such claim.

No Attorney Client Relationship
-------------------------------

The use of and access to TaxBit’s software and Services does not create an attorney-client relationship. You should contact your attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular issue or problem.

CPA Review & Phone Support
--------------------------

TaxBit’s pro plan comes with up to half an hour of phone support from a certified tax expert. Any additional hours may be purchased. TaxBit’s tax experts do not certify the accuracy of the user’s tax forms.

Dispute Resolution; Class Action Waiver
---------------------------------------

_Informal Process First_.  You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and the TaxBit Entities, you will first contact TaxBit and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action.

_Arbitration Agreement_. After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) arising out of or relating in any way to your use of TaxBit’s services and/or products, including the Services, and including without limitation any dispute concerning the construction, validity, interpretation, enforceability, or breach of these Terms, shall be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim, except as permitted herein, upon a party’s submission of the dispute to arbitration. You and TaxBit agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS  under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards (together, the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a dispute, including the determination of whether a dispute is arbitrable. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. You have a right to have the arbitration conducted via telephone, or as an in-person hearing in your hometown area (if you live in the United States) or another location that is reasonably convenient to you.

It is the intent of you and TaxBit that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit in the interests of justice. Failure to adhere to this time limit shall not constitute a basis for challenging the award.

Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor its representatives may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all parties to the Claim.

**_Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations._** **You and TaxBit agree that each party may bring Claims against the other party only in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, including without limitation federal or state class actions, or class arbitrations.  Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this section, (a) no arbitration proceeding hereunder shall be certified as a class action or proceed as a class action, and (b) no arbitration proceeding hereunder shall be consolidated with, or joined in any way with, any other arbitration proceeding without the written consent of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you and TaxBit agree that no dispute shall proceed by way of class arbitration without the written consent of all affected parties.**

_Costs of Arbitration_. Payment for any and all reasonable JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the JAMS Rules. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, TaxBit will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, except that if you have initiated the arbitration claim, you will still be required to pay the lesser of $250 or the maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration claims initiated by you. You are still responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses.

_Opt-Out_. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and waiver of class provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to [Privacy@taxbit.com](mailto:Privacy@taxbit.com)  or to the U.S. mailing address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section of these Terms. The notice must be sent to TaxBit within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms (or if this Section 14 is amended hereafter, within thirty (30) days of such amendment being effective), otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms, and the notice must specify your name and mailing address. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, TaxBit also will not be bound by them.

_Exceptions_. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, You may instead assert your Claim in “small claims” court, but only if your Claim qualifies, your Claim remains only in such court, and your Claim remains on an individual, non-representative and non-class basis. Further, you and TaxBit will have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, or if the Claim relates to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

Injunctive Relief
-----------------

You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to TaxBit for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and TaxBit shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security or proof of damages.

California Residents
--------------------

If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.

Export Laws
-----------

You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services and/or other information or materials provided by TaxBit hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable United States export laws and regulations.

Waiver, Severability & Assignment
---------------------------------

TaxBit’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign these terms, any licenses granted hereunder or any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. TaxBit may assign these Terms, any licenses granted hereunder, and any of its rights or obligations under these Terms.

We may modify these Terms from time to time in which case we will update the “Last Revised” date at the top of these Terms.  If we make changes that are material, we will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you, such as by e-mail and/or by placing a prominent notice on the first page of the Website. However, it is your sole responsibility to review these Terms from time to time to view any such changes.  The updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services after the modifications have become effective will be deemed your acceptance of the modified Terms.
