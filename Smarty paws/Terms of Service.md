Terms of Service
================

### Our Terms of Service

SmartyPaws does not give refunds after a client has signed up and paid for a class, but we may offer credit towards future classes and/or services. SmartyPaws classes fill up quickly. Once the class is full, no one is able to sign up. By signing up and paying for a class, you are guaranteed a training spot in class. Additional people are unable to join the class, once the class is full. However, we will review each situation on a case by case basis.

There are no make up classes. Most trainers review the previous week with their class before moving on to the new material they are teaching. It is your responsibility to attend the classes you have signed up for.

If the trainer has to cancel a class, they will add an additional week at the end of the session to make up for the canceled class.

### Dog Training Liability Waiver

**If you’re planning to engage in any of the services SmartyPaws Canine Coaching LLC offers, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:**

I hereby acknowledge that I have voluntarily applied to participate in dog training activities with SmartyPaws Canine Coaching LLC.

I am aware that there are inherent risks and hazards involved in activities with and around dogs, and I am voluntarily participating in these activities with knowledge of potential dangers. I am aware that any dog, regardless of training, handling, or environmental circumstance, is capable of biting and I expressly acknowledge the risks therein.

In order to participate in dog training classes or other activities, I, being fully informed of such risks and hazards, agree to assume all risks of such occurrences. I hereby waive any and all claims or actions that I or my guardians or representatives may have, from any and all personal injury to myself, my dog, children in my charge, or harm to property or person caused directly or indirectly, through action or inaction of self or others, by acts that might occur in dog training classes, any other format of training activities or secondary training without trainer present or engaged.

I AGREE TO INDEMNIFY SmartyPaws Canine Coaching LLC AND ITS EMPLOYEES AND AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS BY MYSELF, MEMBER OF FAMILY, OR ANY AGENT WHILE WITHIN TRAINING FACILITIES, WITHIN MY HOME PROPERTY, OR IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS A RESULT OF ANY ACTION OR INACTION, OF EITHER MY DOG OR ANY ANOTHER. I ALSO AGREE TO ASSUME SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY MYSELF, CHILDREN IN MY CHARGE, OR BY THE DOG I OWN OR HANDLE AND FURTHER AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD THE INSTRUCTORS, TRAINERS, ASSISTANTS AND PROPERTY HARMLESS FROM ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, LIABILITY OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING LEGAL COST AND ATTORNEY’S FEES, WHICH RESULT FROM DAMAGE CAUSED BY MYSELF, CHILDREN IN MY CHARGE, OR BY THE DOG I OWN OR HANDLE.
