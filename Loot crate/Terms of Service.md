LOOT LAUNCHER™ TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-----------------------------------

Your use of the Loot Launcher™ program is subject to Loot Crate's™ Terms of Service and Loot Crate's™ Privacy Policy (both available on our website), as well as the following additional Terms and Conditions for Loot Crate's™ Loot Launcher™ program (collectively, the "Terms"). By contributing to a Launch, you acknowledge and agree that the Terms apply.

##### WHAT IS LOOT LAUNCHER™?

The Loot Launcher™ program is a platform that allows users to back the production of specific products offered by Loot Crate™ on the platform that might otherwise not be produced ("Launches").

##### HOW DOES IT WORK?

By backing a Launch, you are making a voluntary commitment to pay the amount of your pledged contribution if the Launch becomes fully funded. You will only be charged if a Launch is fully funded. You are able to increase, decrease, or cancel your contribution at any time, until the Launch is fully funded. In the event that your cancellation within 24 hours of the Launch end-date would drop the Launch below its total funding goal, you may be required to contact customer service to process the cancellation.

Once a Launch is fully funded, your commitment to pay becomes binding, and Loot Crate™ will collect your payment in the exact amount of your pledged contribution. You are allowed to increase your pledged amount for any funded Launch. Loot Crate™ may refund individual contributions to a fully-funded Launch in its sole discretion.

If a Launch reaches its end date without fully funding, the Launch is cancelled and no payment is collected.

While Loot Crate™ generally does not collect your payment until a Launch is fully funded, Loot Crate™ reserves the right to authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or other accepted Loot Crate™-approved payment method) in certain instances, for any amount up to the full amount of your pledged contribution, any time between your pledge and the collection of your payment.

##### LAUNCH PERKS

Some Launches may offer additional perks to users that pledge at certain pre-determined higher amounts, as may be specified in each Launch. In addition, some Launches may offer additional perks to all contributing users, if the Launch reaches certain pre-determined total funding levels beyond the original funding goal, as may be specified in each Launch.

##### RIGHT TO CLOSE ACCOUNTS

Loot Crate™ reserves the right to close your user account(s) or to cancel your participation in any specific Launch offered as part of the Loot Launcher™ program, if you breach the Terms or if you are in violation of any law, statute or governmental regulation, subject only to Loot Crate's™ obligation to refund your payments toward any funded Launch from which you are terminated.

##### RIGHT TO CANCEL PROGRAM OR CHANGE TERMS

Loot Crate™ reserves the right to cancel any specific Launch offered as part of the Loot Launcher™ program prior to funding of said Launch, as well as the right to cancel the Loot Launcher™ program, in whole or in part, or to change the Terms at any time in its sole discretion, subject only to Loot Crate's™ obligation to: (1) notify its users of any changes to these Terms; and/or (2) refund any payments made in connection with any funded Launch that is cancelled.

**HOW TO ENTER. Entry as a Loot Crate™ Subscriber:**

To enter the Sweepstakes as a Loot Crate™ subscriber, no action is necessary as long as the account is currently paid and active. If there is a dispute as to the identity of an entrant who made a potentially winning entry, Sponsor will deem that the entry was made by the authorized account holder of the email address. The "authorized account holder" is defined as the natural person to whom the email address is assigned by an internet service provider, online service provider or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address.

You may also enter to win by mailing in your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number to Loot Crate, Inc., 3401 Pasadena Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90031 to the attention of the name of the sweepstakes/contest/giveaway (e.g., Attn: Mega Crate Sweepstakes).

**WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION.**

Beginning on or about the 1st of the month one (1) winner will be randomly generated and chosen by Sponsor from among all eligible entries. Sponsor will make at least two (2) attempts to notify each potential winner via email address submitted at the time of entry. Each potential winner may be required to execute and return an affidavit of eligibility, release of liability, an IRS W-9 form, and, except where prohibited, publicity release (collectively, "Sweepstakes Documents") within thirty (30) days of accepting the prize. Noncompliance within this time period will result in disqualification, and, time permitting, an alternate potential winner(s) may be selected from the remaining eligible entries. If a potential winner cannot be reached, if he/she is found to be ineligible, if he/she cannot or does not comply with these Official Rules, or if his/her prize or prize notification is returned as undeliverable, potential winner will be disqualified and, time permitting, an alternate potential winner may be selected from the remaining eligible entries received. Odds of winning depend upon the total number of eligible entries received. Once all required Sweepstakes Documents have been correctly completed and received from a potential winner, per these Official Rules, the potential winner shall be an official "Prize Winner" of the Contest. Prizes are not transferable, assignable, or redeemable for cash. No substitution for a prize (or parts thereof) by a Prize Winner will be allowed. If necessary, due to unavailability for any reason, a comparable prize will be awarded at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. All Federal, state and local tax liabilities related to the value of the prize awarded are the responsibility of the Prize Winners.

**PRIZES:**

One (1) Grand Prize will be awarded. Grand Prize winner will receive one (1) Mega Crate prize pack comprised of collectibles, apparel, limited edition items and other gear as selected by the Sponsor and published online and via newsletter every month.

**CONDITIONS.**

All entries become the property of Sponsor and will not be acknowledged or returned. Entry constitutes permission (except where prohibited by law) to use entrant's name, city, state, likeness, image, photograph, and/or voice for purposes of advertising, promotion, and publicity in any and all media now or hereafter known, throughout the world in perpetuity, without additional compensation, notification, permission or approval. By entering the Sweepstakes, each entrant agrees for entrant and for entrant's heirs, executors, and administrators: (a) to release and hold harmless Sponsor, all prize providers, and each of their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies, and any other person or entity involved in the development or administration of the Sweepstakes, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and assigns (collectively, "Released Parties") from any liability, illness, injury, death, loss, litigation, or damage that may occur, directly or indirectly, whether caused by negligence or not, from such entrant's participation in the Sweepstakes and/or his/her acceptance, possession, use, or misuse of prize or any portion thereof (including any travel related thereto); (b) to indemnify Released Parties from any and all liability resulting or arising from the Sweepstakes and to hereby acknowledge that Released Parties have neither made nor are in any manner responsible or liable for any warranty, representation, or guarantee, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to any prize, including express warranties provided exclusively by prize suppliers that are sent along with any prize; (c) if selected as a winner, to the posting of such entrant's name on Facebook , Twitter and/or www.lootcrate.com, and the use by Released Parties of such name, and entrant's voice, image, and/or likeness for publicity, promotional, and advertising purposes in any and all media now or hereafter known, throughout the world in perpetuity, without additional compensation, notification, permission or approval and, upon request, to the giving of consent, in writing, to such use; and (d) to be bound by these Official Rules and to waive any right to claim any ambiguity or error herein or in the Sweepstakes itself, and to be bound by all decisions of Sponsor, which are binding and final. Failure to comply with these conditions may result in disqualification from the Sweepstakes.

**ADDITIONAL TERMS.**

Sponsor reserves the right to permanently disqualify any person it believes has intentionally violated these Official Rules. Any attempt to deliberately damage the Sweepstakes or the operation thereof is unlawful and subject to legal action by Sponsor, who may seek damages to the fullest extent permitted by law. The failure of Sponsor to comply with any provision of these Official Rules due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities outside of the control of Sponsor (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations), or other "force majeure" event will not be considered a breach of these Official Rules. Released Parties assume no responsibility for any injury or damage to entrants' or to any other person's computer relating to or resulting from entering or downloading materials or software in connection with the Sweepstakes. Released Parties are not responsible for telecommunications, network, electronic, technical, or computer failures of any kind; for inaccurate transcription of entry information; for errors in any promotional or marketing materials or in these Official Rules; for any human or electronic error; or for entries that are stolen, misdirected, garbled, delayed, lost, late, damaged, or returned. Sponsor reserves the right to cancel, modify, or suspend the Sweepstakes or any element thereof (including, without limitation, these Official Rules) without notice in any manner and for any reason (including, without limitation, in the event of any unanticipated occurrence that is not fully addressed in these Official Rules). In the event of cancellation, modification, or suspension, Sponsor reserves the right to select a winner or winners, in its sole discretion, in a random drawing(s) from among all eligible, non-suspect entries received prior to the time of the event warranting such cancellation, modification, or suspension. Notice of such cancellation, modification, or suspension will be posted at www.lootcrate.com. Sponsor may prohibit any entrant or potential entrant from participating in the Sweepstakes, if such entrant or potential entrant shows a disregard for these Official Rules; acts with an intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any other entrant, Sponsor, or Sponsor's agents or representatives; or behaves in any other disruptive manner (as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion).
