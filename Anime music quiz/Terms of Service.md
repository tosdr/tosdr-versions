Such User-Generated Content submitted by you or others need not be maintained on the Site by us for any period of time and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain, or otherwise use such User-Generated Content on the Site or elsewhere.

### 7\. Our Rules

We may, but are not obligated to, provide our users with the ability to post and receive messages from other animemusicquiz.com-listed users or allow you to participate in video or live chats with your friends or other users. It is your responsibility to maintain proper etiquette, and we reserve the right to terminate the account for anyone who violates our policies. We also do not monitor any particular chat, but reserve the right to delete, or filter any User-Generated Content or username for any reason. If someone posts something that is offensive or objectionable please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you. We do not, however, assume any obligation to remove such User-Generated Content.

You may share videos and music that is hosted on a third party website (i.e., Dailymotion, etc.) but only if it does not conflict with their terms or any applicable law. You may not, however, share, post or otherwise communicate any content (video, audio, or text) that is unlawful, threatening, violent, pornographic, harassing, obscene, racist, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable. We reserve the right to determine what is objectionable at our sole discretion.

In addition to the above, you agree that you will not:

**Don't spam.** Please do not post any graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio or other material that constitutes junk mail or spam. Please do not repeat the same posting multiple times in a day or week.

**Don't be obscene.** You agree not to use any obscene, indecent, or offensive language or to post any graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio or other material that is defamatory, abusive, bullying, harassing, racist, hateful, or violent. Please refrain from ethnic slurs, religious intolerance, homophobia, and personal attacks. Don’t use any sexually explicit language or post any graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio or other material that is sexually explicit.

**Don’t infringe on anyone’s copyright.** You are responsible for ensuring that any graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio or other material you provide to or post on the Website, including without limitation in bulletin boards, forums, personal ads, chats or elsewhere, does not violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or any other personal or proprietary rights of any third party or is provided or posted with the permission of the owner(s) of such rights.

**Don’t engage in criminal behavior.** You may not post any graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio or other material that is encrypted, invades anyone’s privacy, or illustrates, references or encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or that otherwise violates any local, state, federal, national or international law or regulation (e.g., drug use, underage drinking). You agree to use the Website only for lawful purposes and you acknowledge that your failure to do so may subject you to civil and criminal liability.

**Don’t attempt to cheat.** You may not modify the service provided by animemusicquiz.com or use any third party tools to grant you or other players an advantage over other players while using the Site. This covers but is not limited to, viewing videos on the site while they are original not shown, retrieving the url or id of an unshown video, using software to recognize music tracks or share answer with other players before the answer is revealed. Anime Music Quiz reserve the right to decide what constitutes what defines having an unfair advantage in any case.

How we react to your violation of any of these Terms does not mean we will treat everyone the same. We may do anything from yell at you, temporarily suspend your account, ban you, or haul you into Court.

### 8\. Sharing Videos and Music

animemusicquiz.com may permit you to share videos and music with your friends and other players. We may also allow you to use video or live chat to discuss the video or music as it is playing. Please note, however, that we do not host any User-Generated Content ourselves. Instead, you must use our platform to share your video or music from the third party video hosting website. You agree that you will be responsible for the User-Generated Content you upload, and that nothing you share will infringe on the rights of anyone. Furthermore, you warrant you have the ability to grant the right to share such User-Generated Content without any obligation to pay any royalties to any copyright owner. You will be responsible for the payment of any royalty and any associated damages, fees, fines or penalties, in the event we find out you have shared User-Generated Content in violation of another’s intellectual property rights.

Not to sound like a broken record, but we have to make sure you understand that you will be responsible for any User-Generated Content that you upload, including the consequences of any infringement. By sharing any User-Generated Content you are, in essence, utilizing a third party license to distribute and share User-Generated Content. You may only do this if the Site from which you are linking has given you a license to share such User-Generated Content in the manner contemplated. If it does not, then you cannot share that User-Generated Content.

### 9\. DMCA Notices

Animemusicquiz.com has no sense of humor when it comes to intellectual property infringement. In using the Site, you must respect the intellectual property and other rights of Anime Music Quiz and others. Your unauthorized use of Content may violate copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, communications, and other laws, and any such use may result in your personal liability, including potential criminal liability. Anime Music Quiz respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your work has been infringed by means of an improper posting or distribution of it via the Site, then you may request removal of the posting by contacting us at contact@animemusicquiz.com.

We will, in appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers. It is also our policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures we determine are reasonable under the circumstances, i.e., technical measures that are used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works. We retain the discretion to handle non-compliant notices in whatever manner appears to be reasonable given the circumstances presented. Submission of false or misleading information in connection with our DMCA policy may result in termination of your account or other penalties we deem appropriate under the circumstances.

### 10\. Points and Virtual Currency

The Site may include virtual, in-game currency (“Virtual Currency”), such as credits, coins, cash, or points (e.g., Experience Points and Notes), that may be obtained through spending time on the Site. Virtual Currency may be used to purchase virtual, in-game digital items (“Virtual Goods”). Your purchase or award of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are merely a grant by us to a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable right to use the Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods as part of the Site under these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms we provide at the time. Accordingly, you have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, or monetary interest in your Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods, which remain our Content and property. The right may be immediately suspended or terminated for any reason, in our sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability. We reserve the absolute right, at any time and in our sole discretion, to manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods.

Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods cannot be redeemed by you for “real world” money, goods, or other items of monetary value from any party. Transfers of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods by you outside of what we permit on the Site are strictly prohibited. This means you may not buy or sell Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods for “real world” money or otherwise exchange items for value outside of the Site. Any such attempted transfer will be null and void.

You also agree that all sales of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are final unless otherwise detailed in the applicable Additional Terms. No refunds will be given by us. You agree that you will be solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to the acquisition of, use of or access to Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods.

We have the absolute right, but not the obligation, to manage, regulate, control, modify, delete, alter, move, remove, transfer and/or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods, in whole or in part, as we see fit, at any time in our sole discretion, including the right to terminate or suspend your account or discontinue the Site (in whole or in part) for any reason, and we shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. If we suspend or terminate any Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, then you will forfeit the suspended or terminated subscription or items, except as may be set forth in any Additional Terms (such as any refund policies that may apply to the Site). Likewise, except as may be set forth in any Additional Terms or as required by applicable law, we are not responsible for repairing or replacing same, or providing you any credit or refund or any other sum, in the event of our modification of any Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, or for loss or damage due to error, or any other reason.

As we feel necessary, in our sole and absolute discretion, we may limit the total Virtual Currency that may be held in your account in the aggregate. Additionally, price and availability of certain types of Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods are subject to change without notice. You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Virtual Currency has been added to or deducted from your account during any given transaction, so please notify us immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Virtual Currency balance. If we choose, in our discretion, to investigate your claim, in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. We will let you know the results of any investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that we have the sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF ANIME MUSIC QUIZ. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY, VIRTUAL GOODS OR PLUG POINTS THAT YOU ACQUIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR VIRTUAL ITEMS. FURTHERMORE, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE DESTRUCTION, DELETION, MODIFICATION, IMPAIRMENT, “HACKING,” OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY, VIRTUAL GOODS OR PLUG POINTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE DELETION OF THEREOF UPON THE TERMINATION, ABANDONMENT OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT.

**B. Methods of Payment, Credit Card Terms and Taxes.** All payments must be made through your PayPal account or through Visa, MasterCard or American Express (or other form of payment specifically accepted on the Site) and also be in a currency permitted to be used on the Site. We currently do not accept cash, personal or business checks or any other payment form through the Site, although in the future we may change this policy. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You hereby represent and warrant that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so. YOU, AND NOT US, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY. You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred.

Unless you notify us of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes. If we do not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us or its agents.

**C. No Return Policy.** Our current return policy does not permit any returns at this time.

**D. Order Acceptance Policy.** Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order or if we provide you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that: (a) we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion or the quantity not provided (if your credit card has already been charged for the order); or (b) we will not charge your credit card for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not provided. Do not assume that a cancellation or change of an order you have placed with us has been effected until you receive a confirmation from us via email or the Site. As stated above, you will be responsible for, and your credit card or third-party payment account may be charged for, the payment of all fees associated with orders already processed or shipped before your cancellation/change request or a request to terminate your account was received.

**E. No Responsibility to Sell Mispriced Products or Services.** We do our best to describe every item, product or service offered on this Site as accurately as possible.
