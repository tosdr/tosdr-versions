We use Google Analytics on our website, a web analytics service provided by Google, LLC (“Google”).

As a GMX user, you can contact us anytime with questions about the services you use. To provide information, we document the provided services and also the actions taken by you as the customer. Furthermore, using the information provided by you, we ensure that our services are used securely and appropriately. For example, our customer service uses the data you entered to verify your identity should you contact them with a request, in the interests of your own security.  
  
In the area of customer service, the collection of your data is based on the information you provided when concluding the contract. The processing is necessary for contract performance or initiation. The legal basis is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR.

#### 4.2.2 Categories and Origin of Personal Data

In the scope of customer care, we process the following data:

* **User data** – e.g. your name and e-mail address and other contact information.
* **Content data** – content that you actively create or use as a user, for example, your e-mail filters in the settings.
* **Usage data** – all pseudonymized information that arises when you use a service and indicates the scope of use of the product, for example, the number of sent or received e-mails.

  
When entering into a GMX Account contract, you save personal data such as your name, your mailing address, etc.  
  
As a GMX FreeMail user you use certain services or carry out actions. This data is documented by GMX.

#### 4.2.3 Configuration Options

Use of the revocation options under our [GMX T&Cs](https://www.gmx.com/company/terms/).  
  
In general, the following applies: We collect **user data** and **content data** in order to provide our contractually agreed service. Therefore, to object to this processing you must cancel your GMX FreeMail contract and/or delete your account.  
  
You can find configuration options for controlling **interest-based advertising** in the [Data Privacy & Advertising section](https://www.gmx.com/company/privacypolicy/#advertising).  
  
To improve the user experience of our products, websites and applications, we use standardized analysis methods. How you can prevent your data from being used for analysis purposes is described in the [GMX Services section](https://www.gmx.com/company/privacypolicy/#services).

5\. Data Privacy & Advertising at GMX
-------------------------------------

### 5.1 Advertising on the GMX Online Portal

#### 5.1.1 Purpose of Processing and Legal Basis

In order to continue to provide our services to you **free of charge**, we display advertisements. We strive to show you only ads that match your interests.  
  
By targeting advertising that is as interest-based as possible, we try to display content that matches your preferences. In doing so, we primarily present you with advertisements of our own products or products made available through partnerships. In addition, other companies can also book advertising space on our GMX online portal. These bookings financially support the operation of our free product world for you.  
  
In order to guarantee a **pleasant and intuitive user experience**, on our online portal we analyze typical comings and goings of our visitors and the structure of user groups, albeit only on the pseudonymous level. This pseudonymization is a measure to protect the privacy of our users. Information is not stored in plain text and in relation to a specific person, but only as a random identifier consisting of letters and numbers. This helps us avoid showing you online ads too frequently in a certain period of time, for example. For this reason, we allocate a user ID that shows us that someone has already seen this ad often; this is the only way we can control this for you. We do not combine these pseudonymous user profiles with your personal data; therefore, we do not know who you are. We use them exclusively to optimize the user experience. The legal basis of this data processing is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR.  
  
We process the pseudonymized usage data that is generated when using our services on a legal basis in order to improve the user experience on our online portals. In addition, we work together with other partners (third-party providers) in order to be able to display the greatest variety of relevant online advertising outside our online portals. These may also be used as a basis for targeting of interest-based advertising. You can find a list of the most important partners in the [Permission Management](https://www.gmx.com/company/privacypolicy/#permission) under Our Partners.  
  
If you give your consent, the personal or other data we collect or use (such as your email address – in a hashed, pseudonymized form – your IP address, and information about your browser or operating system) may be shared with our partners to provide interest-based content or personalized advertising as you use the internet. For this purpose, an online identifier, which allows you to be recognized on the devices you use, is created and passed on to our partners. The identifier itself does not contain any of your directly identifying personal data.  
  
You can revoke your consent at any time in our [Permission Management](https://www.gmx.com/company/privacypolicy/#permission).  
  
All information collected in connection with advertising on our online portal about the user – and the associated pseudonymized profile formation – is subject to the highest security standards. This information is often stored in cookies. Cookies are small text files stored by your browser and they ensure that a website “remembers” you. This allows websites to load faster on your next visit or usage data to be stored. To find out how you can object to this storage of usage data, see [5.1.3 Configuration Options](https://www.gmx.com/company/privacypolicy/#5configuration).

#### 5.1.2 Categories and Origin of Personal Data

In connection with **advertising on our GMX internet portal** we only process pseudonymized **usage data**. Usage data is understood to be all information that is generated when using a service and which indicates the extent of the use of the product. This includes, for example, click behavior in the GMX portal or the use of other services such as cloud storage and other usage data if you have a GMX account. We collect this data via the device that you use to navigate our portal. If you have a GMX account, we also process **file data**. This information is also stored using a pseudonymous user ID. The processed inventory data contains information that you provided us with during registration.

#### 5.1.3 Configuration Options

**Use of the revocation options under our GMX Data Privacy Notice**  
If you no longer wish to receive interest-based online advertising, you can revoke your consent using the [Permission Management](https://www.gmx.com/company/privacypolicy/#permission).  
  
We also work with other partners to provide you with the widest variety of relevant online advertising. These partners may also display usage-based advertising. A list of the most important partners can be found in the [Permission Management](https://www.gmx.com/company/privacypolicy/#permission) under Our Partners.  
  
**Disable interest-based advertising and reset the ad ID on mobile devices**  
On Android devices, the option "Disable interest-based advertising" is disabled by default. If you want to change this, open Google Preferences, tap on "Ads" and enable it. This opt-out option allows you to disable the display of interest-based ads based on your device's Ad ID. You also have the option to reset the Ad ID. You can also do this in the Google Settings > Privacy > Advertisement:  
Click on "Reset Ad ID" and all information collected so far will be reset and the Ad ID on your device will be replaced by a randomly selected number (menu navigation may vary by device and version).  
  
On iOS devices, the "Restrict ad tracking" option is disabled by default. If you want to change this, open the settings and tap "Privacy". Scroll down to the bottom and tap "Apple Advertising". Here you can restrict the "Personalised Ads". With this opt-out option you can stop the display of interest-based ads based on your device's Ad ID. Additionally, you can reset the Ad-ID.  
On iOS devices (from iOS 14.6), apps must, by default, ask your permission to track your activity on the apps and websites of other companies. You must therefore actively give the app permission to use your individual IDFA (advertising ID). If you have not given the app this permission, then your IDFA (advertising ID) cannot be used. To change this setting, open your iPhone's settings, click on “Privacy,” and then on “Tracking.” If you have already given the app permission, you can disable the permission here. This option allows you to stop targeted ads based on your IDFA (advertising ID) from appearing on your device. However, it does not necessarily reduce the number of ads you receive. Please note: If you have never given the app permission, it will not show up in the list and therefore will not use the IDFA (advertising ID).  
Click on “Reset Ad ID” and any information collected so far will be reset and the Ad ID on your device will be replaced by a randomly selected number (menu navigation may vary depending on the device and version).  
  
On Windows devices, the option "Allow apps to use my Ad ID for cross-app usage" is selected by default. If you want to change this, tap "All Apps" on the home screen of your Windows phone. Scroll down the list to "Settings". Open the settings and tap "Privacy" and in the next menu tap "Advertising ID". Here you can switch off the use of the Ad ID. This opt-out option allows you to disable the display of interest-based ads based on your device's Ad ID. Additionally, you can reset the Ad ID. You can also do this in the Privacy > Advertising: Click on "Reset Advertising ID" and all information collected so far will be reset and the Advertising ID on your device will be replaced by a randomly selected number (menu navigation may vary depending on device and version)  
  
**Use of Advertising ID within applications (Apps)**  
For the targeting of advertising content, we use the Advertising ID within our Android applications or, within our Apple applications, the Advertising ID (IDFA), a device identifier without personal reference. If you download and use applications from 1&1 Mail & Media GmbH, you send us an identification number (Advertising ID) that can be clearly assigned to your device. It is not possible for us to personally identify you using the Advertising ID.

#### 5.1.4 Transfer to Third Parties or Abroad

We understand the importance of adhering to all data privacy regulations when it comes to advertising. When we allocate advertising space on our internet portal, we work with companies from around the world. Many companies are also located abroad. Therefore, in such cases, it is possible that your pseudonymous usage data is used outside of the country where you are located for the selection of advertising.  
  
Handling of your personal data in conformance with data privacy requirements is regulated by the respective applicable law, for example, by the EU General Data Protection Regulation within the EU.

### 5.2 Advertising in the GMX mailbox

#### 5.2.1 Purpose of processing and legal basis

**Your free, secure e-mail account**  
With GMX FreeMail, you experience your e-mail inbox as a comfortable digital home.  
To ensure that we can continue to provide you with these services free of charge, we show advertising. We make every effort to present you only with ads that match your interests. The legal basis for the advertising is Art 6 (1) (a) GDPR regarding consent.  
You can view or revoke your consent at any time in GMX > Help Center.  
We collect, process and use your personal data without further consent insofar as they are necessary for the establishment and processing of contracts and for billing purposes. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. You can object to the further use of your data at any time by sending a written notice to 1&1 Mail & Media GmbH, Data Protection, Elgendorfer Str. 57, 56410 Montabaur, Germany, or by sending an e-mail to dataprivacy@corp.gmx.com. In the event of an objection, it is possible that for technical reasons further data will be sent for a short period of time.  
For the establishment and processing of a contractual relationship, the user's name, address, date of birth, e-mail address, telephone number and bank details, if applicable, and password are generally required (inventory data). These data are usually collected using digital order forms.

#### 5.2.2 Categories and Origin of Personal Data

All categories of data that we collect and process in connection with advertising in the e-mail inbox:

* inventory data
* (pseudonymized) usage data

Your **inventory data**, e.g. your name and address, you gave us at the time of registration.  
  
**Usage data** is understood to be all information that is generated when using our products. With this information, we can constantly improve our service for you by providing you with fewer, but appropriate ads. If this data is not required for billing purposes, it will be deleted after the end of use in accordance with legal regulations.

#### 5.2.3 Configuration Options

Please use the revocation options in accordance with our GMX data protection information.

Therefore, in such cases, it is possible that your pseudonymous usage data may also be used outside Germany to select advertising material. The data protection-compliant handling of your personal data is regulated by the applicable law – within the EU, for example, by the EU Data Protection Basic Regulation.
