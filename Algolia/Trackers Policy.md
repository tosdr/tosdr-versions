What Are Cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your computer, tablet or mobile phone when you visit a website or application. The website or application may retrieve these cookies from your web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) each time you visit, so they can recognise you, remember your preferences and provide you with a more secure online experience.

Generally, cookies are very useful and are a common method used by almost every website you visit because they help to make your online experience as smooth as possible. For security reasons, many websites will not function at all without the use of cookies (or other similar technologies, such as "web beacons" or "tags").

Cookies generally do not hold any information to identify an individual person, but are instead used to identify a browser on an individual machine - as you navigate our websites or your account. This makes navigating and interacting with our websites or your account more efficient, easy and meaningful for you.

Cookies on our websites fall into four categories: (1) Strictly Necessary, (2) Performance, (3) Functional, (4) Targeting, as further described below.

How to Manage Cookies?
----------------------

**Cookie Consent Manager.** You may at any time manage your consent to such categories of Cookies by clicking on the “Cookie Settings” section at the bottom of the page. The Cookie Settings allow you to opt-in or out of cookies by category.

**Browser Settings.** If you prefer, you can restrict, block or delete Cookies by changing your browser settings as instructed below.

However by blocking or deleting Cookies used on our websites, you may not be able to take full advantage of the websites.

For more information about cookies and their impact on you and your browsing visit [www.aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/ "www.aboutcookies.org").

Categories of Cookies
---------------------

### Strictly Necessary

These Cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

### Performance and Measurement

These Cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site.

Sometimes, the services we use to collect this information may be operated by other companies on our behalf. They may use similar technologies to cookies, known as "web beacons" or "tags". These are anonymous and, as they are only used for statistical purposes, they do not contain or collect any information that identifies you.

### Functional

These Cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.

### Targeting

These Cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. Online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.

Managing Cookies
----------------

To adjust your Cookie Settings, click on the icon on the lower left-hand corner of your browser ("Privacy Settings").

Alternatively, you may manage cookies via your browser settings following the below instructions. Most internet browsers allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies (or just third-party cookies) or warn you before a cookie is stored on your device.

Please note, if you choose to block Strictly Necessary cookies, our site will not function as intended and you will not be able to use or access many of the services we provide.
