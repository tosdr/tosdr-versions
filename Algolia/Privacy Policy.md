From time to time, we may include links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours.

7\. How does Algolia keep my information secure?
------------------------------------------------

#### _Section 9 of this Privacy Policy separately covers and applies to personal information submitted by our subscribers to our Services, or collected through our Services on behalf of or at the direction of our subscribers._

Algolia will maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your personal information from accidental loss, unauthorized use, alteration, or disclosure.

Please be careful about giving out information in public areas of our Websites, for example, community message boards or forums. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of our Websites. We cannot control the actions of other users of our Websites with whom you choose to share your information; as such we cannot guarantee your contributed information cannot be viewed by unauthorized parties.

8\. What choices and rights are available to me regarding the use of my personal information?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have the right to access and correct your personal information. If you want to review or correct your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and visit your account profile page, typically designated as “My Account”, or contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.

### Right to Delete Personal Information (“Right to be Forgotten”)

#### _If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding the removal of your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy._

You have the right to request deletion of personal information we hold about you and we have the obligation to erase your personal information, where:

* the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed,
* you withdraw consent on which the processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for the processing,
* you object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing,
* the personal information has been unlawfully processed, or
* the personal information has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in the European Union or a Member State law to which Algolia is subject.

If you want to request removal of your personal information from our Websites or Services, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above. You can also request closure of your account. We will respond to your request within 30 days.

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know that we are unable to do so and why.

### Right to Data Portability

#### _If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding the data portability of your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy._

You have the right to receive or transfer a copy of your personal information, where:

* we are relying upon your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party as the legal basis for the processing, and
* personal information is processed by automatic means.

This copy will be provided to you in a common machine-readable format. You may also require us to transmit it to another party where this is technically feasible.

If you want to request a copy of your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.

### Right to Restrict Personal Information Processing

You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal information, where:

* you contest the accuracy of the personal information until we take sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy,
* where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal information,
* where we no longer need the personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or
* where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below) pending verification as to whether Algolia has compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
* Where personal information is subjected to restriction in this way we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. This right includes restricting the processing of your personal information to only include storage of your personal information (e.g. during the time when Algolia assesses whether you are entitled to have personal information erased).

9\. Subscriber Data submitted to our Services or collected through our Services (on behalf of our subscribers)

Algolia processes data only as provided in our subscription agreements with our subscribers, such as our Terms of Service available at [https://www.algolia.com/policies/terms/](https://www.algolia.com/policies/terms/). Additional information about our privacy and security practices with respect to our Services is available in our security and compliance documentation available at [https://www.algolia.com/distributed-secure/security-compliance/](https://www.algolia.com/distributed-secure/security-compliance/).

As subscribers (or in some cases their internet clients or end users) control the data to be processed, Algolia’s network, platform, and Services may be used as a conduit for information.

The use of personal information collected through our Services at the direction of our subscribers shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Services for which the subscriber has engaged Algolia.

Although Algolia collects personal information related to subscriber personnel as they configure a subscriber’s use of our Services, Algolia has no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information is hosted or transmitted through the Services by subscribers or their permitted internet clients or end users. Subscribers are responsible for complying with any regulations or laws that require providing notice, disclosure, and/or obtaining consent prior to transferring the data to Algolia for processing purposes.

Algolia also collects, uses, and discloses personal information of individuals who visit our Websites (“Visitors”) and individual representatives of our subscribers, suppliers, and business partners (“Business Contacts”). This Section 9 does not apply to personal information associated with Visitors and Business Contacts collected, stored, and processed by Algolia which are governed by the other provisions of this Privacy Policy.

### Choice

Our Services collect personal information for our subscribers. As a data processor of this personal information on our subscriber’s behalf, Algolia has limited ability to access personal information our subscribers submit to our Services. If you are a data subject for whom a subscriber has submitted personal information to the Services and would like your information not to be disclosed to a third-party or to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which the personal information was originally collected, then you should contact the subscriber directly. Concerns with personal information hosted or transmitted at the direction of our subscribers may be reported according to our acceptable use policy available at [https://www.algolia.com/distributed-secure/security-compliance/](https://www.algolia.com/distributed-secure/security-compliance/). We will refer your requests to the appropriate subscriber.

### Sub-processor Accountability

Algolia is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives, and subsequently transfers to a third-party acting as an agent on its behalf in accordance with our subscription agreements. Algolia may use from time to time third-party service providers, contractors, and sub-processors to assist in providing the Services on our behalf. Algolia maintains contracts with these third-parties restricting their access, use, and disclosure of personal information.

### Security Measures

Algolia maintains administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect data submitted to the Services, including personal information.

Algolia may process data to provide the Services, to prevent or address technical or service problems, to follow the instructions of our subscribers and their personnel who submitted the personal information, or in response to contractual or legal requirements. Algolia does not control or own the data submitted by its subscribers, or their internet clients or end users, to the Services. Algolia may share personal information with its subsidiaries, contractors, or third-parties if Algolia undergoes a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.

### Data Subject Rights to Subscriber Data

Algolia has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information our Services process on behalf of our subscribers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal information should direct his or her query to the appropriate subscriber (i.e., the data controller). Subscribers have the ability to fulfill these requests, and Algolia will provide assistance for requests that subscribers are not able to complete. If the subscriber requests that Algolia remove the personal information, we will refer your request to the applicable subscriber and we will respond to the request within 30 days.

### Subscriber Data Retention

Algolia retains the personal information we process on behalf of our subscribers for as long as needed to provide the Services to our subscribers and in accordance with our subscription agreements.
