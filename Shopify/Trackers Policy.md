Privacy
=======

Shopify strongly believes in protecting personal information, and understands that doing so is critical in helping you preserve the trust and confidence of your customers. Shopify has designed its platform to allow you to offer your customers transparency into and control over their personal information. Shopify believes in making it easy for you to use its platform in a manner that complies with privacy and data protection laws around the world. Refer to the [Shopify Privacy Policy](https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy) for more information.

Shopify does what it can to set you up for success, but there's also steps that you'll need to take on your own. If you have specific legal questions about which laws apply to you, or questions specific to your business, then consult with a local lawyer who is familiar with data protection laws.
