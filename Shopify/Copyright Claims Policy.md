Legal removals and intellectual property
========================================

Shopify respects the valid intellectual property (IP) rights of others and we expect merchants to do the same. Posting content that constitutes an infringement of others' legal rights violates [Shopify's Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup) and the content can be removed at Shopify's discretion.

While Shopify respects legitimate IP rights, it will also not let its policies be abused - the submission of false or bad faith notices of claimed IP infringement is punishable by law. Those harmed by such claims, including Shopify itself, may sue for damages and attorneys' fees.
