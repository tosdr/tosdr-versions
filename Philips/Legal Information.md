* **You have the right to delete your personal data.** This means that you can ask us to erase the personal data that we process about you. Keep in mind that there might be cases (for example, when we are legally obliged to keep your personal data) where we may not be able to erase your personal data.
* **You have the right to data portability.** This means that you can ask us to transfer the information about you (that you have directly given to us) to another organization, or give it to you. Keep in mind that this right only applies in certain circumstances (for example, if we are processing your personal data with automated means and based on your consent).
* **You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal data.** This means that, in certain circumstances, you can ask us to limit the way we use your personal data.
* **You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data.** This means that, in certain circumstances, you can object to the processing of your personal data, as carried out by us.

  
Keep in mind that there may be situations where we are entitled to deny or restrict your privacy rights, for example, when it is necessary to establish, exercise or defend Philips from legal claims or when your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character.  
At Philips, we aim to give you control over your personal data. Therefore, depending on the activity, you can control your personal data and exercise your privacy rights and choices by yourself, for example by logging in to your Philips account and updating, modifying or deleting your personal data or by unsubscribing to our promotional communications by means of the unsubscribe button (link) included at the bottom of our promotional communications.

  
In all other cases, to exercise your privacy rights, to submit a privacy complaint or to contact our Data Protection Officer, you can contact us following our [privacy contact form](https://www.philips.co.uk/c-e/privacy-request.html).

  
We will do our best to address your request in time and free of charge. In certain cases, we may ask you to verify your identity before acting on your request.  Of course, if you are not happy with how we have handled your request, you can make a complaint to the supervisory authority competent for your country or region.

### With whom we share your personal data

  
Unless otherwise stated in this notice, these are the categories of third parties with whom we may share your personal data:  
  

* **Our Philips-affiliated companies.** Due to our global nature, your personal data may be disclosed to other Philips-affiliated companies. Of course, we will make sure that access to your personal data will be granted on a need-to-know basis. In addition, keep in mind that our Philips-affiliated companies are obligated to handle your personal data in accordance with our [Philips Privacy Rules](https://www.philips.com/c-dam/corporate/privacy/philips-privacy-rules-csb-data.pdf). This ensures that your personal data will be processed by Philips following the same data protection standards.  
    

* **Our service providers.** We may engage with third party service providers (e.g. IT providers, customer service providers) and ask them to perform certain processing operations on our behalf, such as storing personal data. When we do so, we make sure that these service providers are contractually obliged not to use your personal data for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law.  
    
* **Our business partners:** sometimes, we may partner with our business partners to provide you with services, and in this context, we may share your personal data with them. For example, if you purchase a product from our e-shop, we share your information with payment service providers to process the payments.  
    
* **Third parties in connection with corporate transactions:** at times, we may be involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, joint venture, reorganization, sale of assets or other disposition of al  or any portion of our business, assets or stock. In these cases, we may share your personal data with the third party involved in that corporate transaction.  
    
* **Others:** for legal reasons, we may also share your personal data with others (such as public and governmental authorities, professional advisors) if we determine that access, use, preservation or disclosure of your personal data is necessary to: 1) comply with applicable laws and regulations or enforceable governmental requests; 2) investigate, prevent or take actions regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; 3) enforce our terms and conditions with you; 4) investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations; 5) protect the security or integrity of our services; 6) exercise or protect the rights and safety of Philips, our Philips customers, personnel or others.
