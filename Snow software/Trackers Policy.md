#### My tech spend isn’t optimized

Managing your sprawling hybrid IT portfolio creates a unique challenge when overseeing the associated spend. With Flexera, gain visibility and use actionable insights to improve your ROI by maximizing usage of existing resources across your cloud, SaaS, containers, desktop and data center.

#### I can’t identify unknown, vulnerable, unused or obsolete assets in my IT environment

When you’re unable to identify unknown, vulnerable, unused or obsolete software and hardware, you incur tech debt and create security or compliance risks—and that can cause major issues for your organization. With Flexera, you can proactively manage software vulnerability and obsolescence risk in your IT environment, prioritize remediation of end-of-life and vulnerable technology, and enable business transformation and modernization.

#### I have pervasive shadow IT

You can’t manage what you can’t see—and shadow IT causes wasted time, inconsistent business approaches, wasted investments, inefficiencies, and a higher incidence of compliance and security risk. With Flexera, shine a light on shadow IT activity across software, SaaS (including generative AI applications), cloud, containers and more. Reduce the operational expense of your tech investments, select and fund revenue-increasing initiatives and increase the success rate of initiatives like cloud migration, data center consolidation and IT transformation.

#### I have a risk of unbudgeted spending

If you’re not proactively calculating your license positions and IT spend, your organization is at risk for unbudgeted true-up expenses and audits. Plus, with the explosion of cloud, you may struggle with runaway costs and out-of-balance spending. Flexera offers a unique approach to your organization’s hybrid ITAM and FinOps journey that enables IT, operations, procurement, cloud centers of excellence, enterprise architects and FinOps teams to work collaboratively with business units and resource owners to gain visibility and identify areas of savings opportunities.

#### I can’t identify or remediate IT waste

Wasted spend across desktop, data center, SaaS and IaaS/PaaS remains high among enterprises, around an average 20-30%\*. Flexera helps you see the technology you’re using so you can eliminate unused subscriptions and rationalize applications and vendors based on trusted, actionable data. With Flexera, you get the insights you need to purchase only the technology necessary.

You need to regularly report on environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives, but you lack the visibility and understanding of how your IT environment is driving sustainability initiatives.

Don’t just take our word for it
-------------------------------

\[Flexera\] is the best tool I’ve ever used. I look at Flexera data and 95% time it’s right and that’s way better than anyone else out there. It’s doing as good as I could ever want. Overall, it’s hands down the best tool in the market \[for asset management\].

Director, ITAM Global insurance company

It’s key for us that Flexera is our trusted source.  I will say to our vendors, “You want to audit us? Go ahead. It’s going to be more expensive for you than it is for us. We will counter any audit with our governance and our data, which is difficult to dispute because we use Flexera.”

VP, Global Asset Management Global insurance company

The data that Flexera provides is the key. It’s why we bought Flexera. It’s being leveraged across lots of different areas of our organization. If we didn’t have the support of Flexera, specifically the discovery catalog, SKU catalog, and Technopedia, we would not be successful.

Director of Technology Global communications company

We have driven a significant amount of value in the company, both in green dollars and what we call brown dollars or cost avoidance. We optimize license positions, remediate noncompliance, etc., and we now have this tracked on a near-daily basis. At the foundation of all that has been the successful implementation of Flexera. It’s core to everything we do globally from a software asset management perspective.

VP, Global Asset Management Global insurance company

My data is right. My data comes out of Flexera. Anybody that looks elsewhere, they're getting the wrong numbers.

Senior Director of Cloud Large Food and Beverage Manufacturer

In the specific area of IT tracking, the best solution I’ve seen lately is Flexera, which helps companies of every size get a handle on their hardware, understand their ongoing operations and exposures, and then figure out what needs to be done to rationalize and ultimately optimize the whole messy IT sprawl.
