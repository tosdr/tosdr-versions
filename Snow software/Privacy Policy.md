Privacy protection is very important to us, and we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This privacy notice sets out information about how we collect, store, transfer, use and otherwise process personal information.

#### A. General Provisions

1. **Who we are.**
    
    Flexera Software LLC, 300 Park Blvd, Suite 400, Itasca, IL 60143, (â**Flexera Software LLC**â) is generally responsible for and controls the processing of your personal information collected through the Services.
    
    However, if you retain Services directly from a local Flexera group company (i.e., when you have concluded a contract with one of the local Flexera group companies) or otherwise do business with that Flexera group company and share personal information with that company, that company is the data controller in relation to all personal information obtained, used and otherwise processed in relation to such Services.
    
    The expressions â**Flexera**,â â**we**â and â**our**â include Flexera Software LLC and any other Flexera group company from whom you retain Services. For the contact details of all Flexera group companies see: [https://www.flexera.com/about-us/contact-us/office-locations](https://www.snowsoftware.com/about-us/contact-us/office-locations).
    
    Any Services where a Flexera group company processes personal information based on a data processing agreement entered with you or your employer (or other similarly situated entity) are not covered by this privacy notice. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.
    
2. **Global applicability and region-specific disclosures.**
    
    This privacy notice is designed to apply to our Website visitors, users of our Services and other companies and users on a global basis. Therefore, section A applies to any processing of personal information worldwide.
    
    We may choose or be required by law to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal information about residents of certain countries, regions or states. Please refer below for disclosures that may be applicable to you:
    
    **Europe**  
    The processing covered by the Europe-specific privacy disclosures contained in section B include our processing of personal information (i) relating to individuals in the European Union, the UK, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland - all of which will, for the purpose of this privacy notice, be defined as âEuropeâ - if we either offer goods or services to such individuals or monitor their activities in Europe, or (ii) where the processing is undertaken by or on behalf of a Flexera group company located in Europe. Please click [here](#GDPR) for additional Europe-specific privacy disclosures.
    
    **California**  
    If you are a resident of the State of California in the United States, please click [here](#CCPA) for additional California-specific privacy disclosures in section C containing information about the processing of your personal information and the rights granted to you by California law.
    
3. **What is personal information?**
    
    When we use the term â**personal information**â in this privacy notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you. It does not include aggregated information that is maintained in a form that is not capable of being associated with or reasonably linked to you.
    
4. **What personal information do we collect?**
    
    In the context of rendering our Services, we may collect personal information about you. This personal information regularly includes the following:

We may collect any of your User Contributions, your username, your name, company name, company email address as well as your IP address. Please note that we cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed or processed by other persons.
    * **If you contact us (via our Websites or via phone, email or letter), e.g., for a support request:** Name, company name, company address, company email address, company phone number and information on our communication with you, your interest(s) in Flexera and/or its Services and any additional information you provide us with.
    * **If you merely use our Websites:** IP address, browser data, device type, Uniform Resource Locators (URL), operating system, site preferences and information on your usage of our Websites.
    * **If you participate in our events, such as webinars, and trade fair booth events, or if you download our white papers:** Name, company name, email address, phone number, address, position/job title, job function, job level and any information on the event or download.

5. **How do we collect your personal information?**
    
    The personal information is collected in many ways and may include:
    
    * **Personal information you provide to us.** Most of the personal information we receive comes to us voluntarily from our users in the course of using our Services, communicating with us in the procurement of or in the process of requesting our Services, registering to attend a seminar or participate in a survey, interacting with us at trade shows or conventions or other industry events or asking to be included in an email or other communication list, or other product promotions.
        
        You are free to choose which personal information you want to provide to us or whether you want to provide us with any personal information at all. However, some personal information, such as your name, address, payment information and information on your requested Services may be necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations. Without providing this personal information, you will not be able to order certain Services or enter into a contract with us.
        
    * **Personal information collected via technology.** As you use our Services, we may collect information automatically, such as log information and through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies. Please see our section â[How do we use cookies and other Tracking Technology](#cookies)?â below for more information.
    * **Personal information we receive from others.** We may receive personal information about users from publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, third parties such as social media sites, law enforcement agencies, providers of denied party screening and marketing consultants and partners. We may also receive personal information, such as contact details, including name, position, phone or email address from our partners and customers.
6. **Why we collect and use your personal information?**
    
    The reasons for using your personal information may differ depending on the purpose of the collection. Regularly, we use your personal information for the following purposes:
    
    * **Providing our Services**. If you order Services from Flexera or if you contact us to request our Services, we use your personal information to provide you with these Services.
    * **Pursue our business interests.** The usage of your personal information may also be necessary for our own business interests. For example, we may use some of your personal information to evaluate and review our business performance, create financial statements, improve our Services, provide advertising or to identify potential cyber security threats. We may use your personal information for marketing purposes, for example, to send you relevant product updates and/or share your contact information such as name, email address or phone number with reseller partners for them to directly contact, qualify and manage the customer relationship. In the case that a reseller partner uses your contact details for own marketing purposes, we or the reseller will do so only if you have granted a respective separate consent. If necessary, we may also use your personal information to pursue or defend ourselves against legal claims.
    * **Purpose for which consent has been provided.** In some cases, we may ask you to grant us separate consent to use your personal information.
        
        We often work on the basis of consent in relation to sales and marketing campaigns. For example, if you sign up to our email newsletter, you allow us to send marketing communication to you, or when our marketing partners provide us with your email address, we will process your data to the extent covered by your consent. If you want to learn about your options regarding withdrawing your consent to receive marketing communication, please see our section â[E-Mail Settings and Preferences](#preferences).â If you want to learn more about your options to avoid Tracking Technology, please see our section â[How do we use cookies and other Tracking Technology](#cookies)?â.
        
        If you have granted us consent to use your information, we will use it only for the purposes for which you have granted your consent. You are free to deny your consent and the denial will have no negative consequences for you. You are also free to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future.
        
    * **Comply with legal obligations.** We are obligated to retain certain information because of legal requirements, for example, tax or commercial laws, or we may be required by law enforcement to provide personal information on request.
7. **With whom do we share your personal information?**
    
    As required in accordance with how we use it, we will share your personal information with the following third parties:
    
    * **Flexera group companies.** To support our sales and marketing efforts, as well as in the performance of the Services, your personal information may be disclosed to Flexera group companies. Further information regarding the Flexera group companies can be obtained [here](https://www.snowsoftware.com/about-us).
    * **Service providers and advisors.** We may use third party vendors and other service providers to perform services on our behalf. Such services may include marketing campaign services, providing mailing or email services, tax and accounting services, product fulfilment, payment processing, conducting surveys or contests, performing customer service, performing data enhancement services, performing fraud prevention services, performing web hosting services or providing analytic services. These third parties, whose services Flexera Software LLC regularly uses include, in particular: Eloqua, SalesForce.com, Lithium, Gainsight, Melissa Data and Snowflake. Any such service providers will by appropriate data processing agreements be bound to only process the data on Flexeraâs behalf and under its instructions, unless such service providers act as their own controllers (e.g., in the case we seek advice from lawyers and tax consultants).
    * **Promotional partners.** Third parties with whom we partner to provide promotional activities, which will be identified by name in the context of these activities. We may, for example, share contact details with reseller partners.
    * **Purchasers and third parties in connection with a business transaction.** Third parties in connection with a Flexera-related transaction, such as a merger, sale of Flexera assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion of our business, or in the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceedings.
    * **Law enforcement, regulators, and other parties for legal reasons.** Third parties as required by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our legal claims or to protect the security or integrity of our Services; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of Flexera employees, our visitors or others.
    * **The public, when posted in certain public spaces.** Remember, our Websites allow you to connect and interact with others. Your profile information or information that you post in a forum or on a blog, including personal information, will be available publicly to other members of the Websites by default when you create a profile, post in a blog or forum or interact with others on the Websites in public groups and post content to public spaces.
    * **Otherwise with consent**. We may disclose an individualâs personal information to certain other third parties with that individualâs consent.
8. **How do we safeguard your personal information when there is an international transfer?**
    
    As Flexera Software LLC is located in the USA, any information you provide will be processed and stored in the USA.
    
    Furthermore, some other Flexera group companies who may process your personal information depending on the Services you are using are also located outside Europe. Our Flexera group companies are, for example, located in Japan, Australia, India, and China. Further information regarding the Flexera group companies can be obtained [here](https://www.snowsoftware.com/about-us).
    
    This may mean that your personal information will be stored in a jurisdiction that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal information than the jurisdiction you are typically a resident in.
    
    Further Europe-specific information regarding the safeguards we have in place can be obtained [here](#GDPR).
    
9. **How do we use cookies and other Tracking Technology?**
    
    When using our Services, we and our third-party partners may automatically collect certain types of usage information. For this purpose, we often rely on tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts and similar technology (collectively, â**Tracking Technologies**â) in accordance with this notice. Where legally required, we will inform you about the use of such tracking technologies using so-called cookie-banners and/or obtain your consent to use such Tracking Technology.
    
    * **How do these Tracking Technologies work?** Cookies are pieces of code that allow for personalization of the Services experience by saving your personal information such as user ID and other preferences. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device's hard disk (such as your computer or smartphone) for record-keeping purposes. Cookies store certain settings and data for exchange with our system via your browser. A cookie usually contains the name of the domain from which the cookie has been placed, as well as information about the age of the cookie and a random alphanumeric identifier, the so-called cookie-ID. They help to recognize the device and make any pre-settings immediately available. Web beacons are small graphical images that may be included on our Sites and typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behaviour. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

    * **What are Cookies and other Tracking Technologies used for?** Tracking Technologies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how our Websites are being used, helping us analyse trends, administering the Websites, tracking usersâ movements around the Websites, gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience. Tracking Technology can also help ensure that you see marketing content that is more relevant to you and your interests. Therefore, generally speaking, we use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website(s); (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c)Â recognize and contact you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage and demographic patterns on our Websites; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise plan for and enhance our Services.

They remember that you have visited a website and may track you on other websites. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertising partners.
    * **How long will cookies stay on your browsing device?** The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing the website that has set the cookie. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device after you have finished browsing a particular website, until they are deleted or until they expire. The actual period of validity of each persistent cookie depends on each cookie. However, they generally expire within 3 months. You can amend your cookie settings using your internet browserâs settings.

#### B. Additional Europe-specific disclosures

18. **Scope of the disclosure.**
    
    These Additional Europe-specific disclosures supplement the information contained in our privacy notice above to comply with the requirements under applicable data protection law in Europe, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation (â**GDPR**â). Unlike the generally applicable section A. of this privacy notice, these Additional Europe-specific disclosures apply only to our processing of personal information where the processing of personal information relates to individuals in Europe -âwhere we either offer goods or services to such individuals or monitor their activities in Europe or where the processing is undertaken by or on behalf of a Flexera company or branch established in Europe.
    
19. **Information on data processing rendered by us on behalf of customers.**
    
    Where a Flexera group company processes personal information based on a data processing agreement entered with you or your employer (or other similarly situated entity), the respective Flexera group company is not the data controller but a data processor.
    
    The use of personal information provided to us as a data processor by our customers for the purpose of processing on their behalf shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Service for which the customer has engaged Flexera (data processing on behalf of customer).
    
    Flexera acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Flexera has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes on behalf of its customers. An individual who seeks access or who seeks to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to Flexeraâs customer (the data controller). If requested to remove data we are processing for our customer, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.
    
20. **Legal basis based on which we collect and use your personal information.**
    
    Regularly, we use your personal information based on the following legal grounds according to the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018:
    
    * **Perform of our contractual services or prior to entering into a contract with you**. If you order Services from Flexera or if you contact us to request our Services, we use your personal information to provide you with these Services.
    * **Justified by our legitimate interests.** The usage of your personal information may also be necessary for our own business interests. For example, we may use some of your personal information to evaluate and review our business performance, create financial statements, improve our Services, provide advertising or to identify potential cyber security threats. We may use your personal information for marketing purposes, for example, to send you relevant product updates and/or share your contact information such as name, email address or phone number with reseller partners for them to directly contact, qualify and manage the customer relationship. To the extent we rely on legitimate interests to process your data for marketing purposes (for example, in the case that you have provided your email address in connection with the purchase of our services), you may object to such processing at any time via [https://info.flexera.com/Manage-Preferences](https://info.flexera.com/Manage-Preferences?lead_source=Website%20Visitor&id=Flexera.com-Legal) or by using the link provided to you at the end of each promotional communication. You may also contact us using the contact details set out at the end of section A to request that we remove you from our email list. If necessary, we may also use your personal information to pursue or defend ourselves against legal claims.
    * **Consent** In some cases, we may ask you to grant us separate consent to use your personal information. Please see â[What rights and choices do you have?](#rights)â regarding the choices and rights you have in this respect.

    We do not use your personal information for automated individual decision-making.
    
21. **Additional information on international data transfers.**
    
    [![TRUSTe](https://privacy-policy.truste.com/privacy-seal/seal?rid=c1aff876-f113-47d9-8b5b-0d9a1ce0fce6)](https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/validation?rid=c1aff876-f113-47d9-8b5b-0d9a1ce0fce6)We may transfer personal information about you outside Europe and when we do so, we rely on appropriate or suitable safeguards recognized under applicable law in Europe, including adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses that have been adopted by the European Commission and provide appropriate guarantees for the transfer of personal information.
    
    * **Flexera-internal transfers.**
        
        As regards the sharing of personal information with Flexera group companies located outside Europe, Flexera has entered into data transfer agreements based on the Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission. The data transfer agreements between the Flexera group entities also make use of the Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission for data transfers to Flexera group entities located in the US, the UK or any other country in which we have subsidiaries for as long as these countries are not acknowledged by the European Commission or Switzerland as providing for an adequate level of data protection. If you would like to obtain further information, please contact us using the contact details set out at the end of section A.
        
    * **External transfers.**
    
    We may transfer personal information about you to countries that the European Commission has deemed to adequately safeguard personal information. We may also use Standard Contractual Clauses when transferring personal information from a country in Europe to a country outside Europe that has not been deemed to adequately safeguard personal information. The same applies to data transfers from the European Economic Area or Switzerland to the UK as well as data transfers from the UK to other countries that are not recognized by the UK to adequately safeguard personal information. If you would like to obtain further information, please contact us using the contact details set out at the end of section A.
    
22. **How long do we keep your personal information?**
    
    We will store personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collect the personal information, and in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests. Personal information collected in connection with the Websites by Eloqua that offers marketing services will be identified for manual removal after 18 months of no interaction between the data subject and Flexera. Additionally, personal information processed by Flexera as a data processor will be removed in accordance with the instructions of the applicable data controller.
    
    If you signed up for our promotional emails, we will delete the respective personal information if you unsubscribe from receiving our promotional emails. However, we will store your email address in a âdo not contactâ list to ensure that you will not receive any further communication.
    
23. **Additional Europe-specific information on childrenâs privacy.**
    
    From children under the age of 16 residing in Europe, we will not process any personal information on the ground of a consent.

    * **Right to object**. You have a right to object to any processing based on our legitimate interests where there are grounds relating to your particular situation. You can object to marketing activities for any reason whatsoever.

#### C. Additional California-specific disclosures

25. **Scope of notice.**
    
    These Additional California specific disclosures (the â**CA Notice**â) supplements the information contained in the privacy notice above and applies solely to individual residents of the State of California (â**consumers**â or â**you**â).
    
    This CA Notice provides additional information about how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information of individual residents of the State of California, either online or offline, within the scope of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (â**CCPA**â).
    
    Unless otherwise expressly stated, all terms in this CA Notice have the same meaning as defined in our privacy notice above or as otherwise defined in the CCPA.
    
26. **General remarks on personal information disclosures.**
    
    When we use the term â**personal information**â in this CA Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
    
    For the purposes of this CA Notice, the term personal information does not include:
    
    * Publicly available information from government records.
    * De-identified or aggregated information that is maintained in a form that is not capable of being associated with or linked to you.
    * Information excluded from the CCPA's scope, such as:

        * Information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FRCA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994.
    * Information relating to our job applicants, employees, contractors and other personnel.
27. **Information on data processing rendered by us on behalf of customers.**
    
    Where a Flexera group company processes personal information based on a data processing agreement entered with you or your employer (or other similarly situated entity), the respective Flexera group company is not the âbusinessâ that determines the purposes and means of the processing of consumersâ personal information, but a âservice providerâ within the meaning of the CCPA.
    
    The use of personal information provided to us as a service provider by our customers for the purpose of processing on their behalf shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Service for which the customer has engaged Flexera (data processing on behalf of customer).
    
    Flexera acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Flexera has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes on behalf of its customers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to Flexeraâs customer (the business). If requested by our customer to remove data we are processing on their behalf and at their direction, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

29. **Disclosure and sale of personal information.**
    
    As described in the â[With whom do we share your personal information?](#whom_we_share)â section in our privacy notice, we have disclosed personal information within Flexera and with a variety of third parties for business purposes.
    
    In the previous 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information to third parties for a business purpose:
    
    * All of the categories of personal information we collect, explained in the table above.
    
    **\*Note about âSalesâ:** Flexera does not âsellâ personal information as most people would typically understand that term. However, we do allow certain third-party advertising partners to collect information about consumers through our Services for purposes of serving ads that are more relevant, for ad campaign measurement and analytics and for ad fraud detection and reporting. To the extent these practices qualify as âsalesâ under the CCPA, you may have the right to opt out as described in the â[California-specific rights](#CA)â section below.
    
30. **California-specific rights.**
    
    As a California resident, you may be able to exercise the following rights in relation to the personal information about you that we have collected (subject to certain limitations at law):
    
    * **Right of access**. The right to access and obtain a copy of the personal information we have collected about you in the last 12 months.
    * **Right to knowledge:** The right to request the following information from the last 12 months relating to the personal information we have collected about you:
        * The categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;
        * The categories of sources of the personal information;
        * The purposes for collecting the personal information;
        * The categories of third parties with whom we share the personal information; and
        * The categories of personal information we have disclosed for a business purpose and the categories of recipients.
    * **Right to deletion.** The right to request the deletion or erasure of personal information we have collected about you.
    * **Right to opt out.** The right to direct us not to sell personal information we have collected about you to third parties now or in the future.
    * **Right to opt in.** If you are under the age of 16: The right to authorize us, or have your parent or guardian authorize us, to sell personal information about you.
    * **Non-discrimination.** The right to be free from discrimination for exercising any of the rights described above. Please note, however, that if the exercise of the rights described above limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may not be able to provide our services and offerings to individuals who exercise these rights, or to otherwise engage with such individuals going forward.
31. **How to exercise your California-specific rights.**
    * **To exercise your right to know or right to deletion.** To exercise your right to know and/or right to deletion, please submit a request by:
        
        * Emailing [DataProtectionTeam@Flexera.com](mailto:DataProtectionTeam@Flexera.com) with the subject line âCalifornia Rights Request,â; or
        * Filling out our California Resident Rights Request Form.
        
        Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm you are a resident of the State of California. In order to verify your identity, we will generally require you to (1) log into your account if you have one, or (2) require you to provide sufficient information to enable us to identify the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional personal information from you, including, but not limited to your name, email, address, and/or date of last interaction with customer service. We will only use personal information provided in connection with a Consumer Rights Request to review and comply with the request.
        
        In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your personal information in our systems. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request.
        
        **Authorized Agents**
        
        In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent (as that term is defined by the CCPA) to submit requests on your behalf through the designated methods set forth in this CA Notice where we can verify the authorized agentâs authority to act on your behalf by:
        
        * For requests to know or delete personal information:
            * receiving a power of attorney valid under the laws of California from you or your authorized agent; or
            * receiving sufficient evidence to show that you have:
                * provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf;
                * verified your own identity directly with us pursuant to the instructions set forth in these Disclosures; and
                * directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf.
        * For requests to opt-out of personal information âsalesâ: receiving a signed permission demonstrating your authorized agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
    * **To exercise your right to opt out of personal information sales**
        
        As noted above, we do not âsellâ personal information as most people would typically understand that term. However, as is common practice among companies that operate online, we permit third party advertising networks, social media companies and other third party businesses to collect and disclose your personal information (including Internet/Network Information, Commercial Information, and Inferences) directly from your browser or device through cookies or tracking technologies when you visit or interact with our websites or engage with us online. These third parties use this information for the purposes of serving ads that are more relevant, for ad campaign measurement and analytics, and for fraud detection and reporting and they may sell that information to other businesses for advertising and other purposes. By visiting [www.privacyrights.info](https://www.privacyrights.info/) or [https://optout.privacyrights.info/](https://optout.privacyrights.info/?c=1), you can opt out from sales of this type of personal information by businesses that participate in the opt out tool. To make opt-out requests related to mobile apps on your device for businesses participating in the DAAâs CCPA App-based Opt-Out Tool, you can download the appropriate app at www.youradchoices.com/appchoices. To learn more about how third parties collect information automatically and the choices you may have in relation to those activities, please see â[How can you manage cookies from our Websites?](#cookies)â and â**Interest-based advertising**â in the â[How do we use cookies and other Tracking Technology?](#cookies)â section of our privacy notice.
        
32. **Minors under age 16.**
    
    We do not sell the personal information of consumers we know to be less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "Right to Opt In") from either the minor who is between 13 and 16 years of age or the parent or guardian of a minor less than 13 years of age. Please contact us at [DataProtectionTeam@Flexera.com](mailto:DataProtectionTeam@Flexera.com) to inform us if you or your minor child are under the age of 16.Â
