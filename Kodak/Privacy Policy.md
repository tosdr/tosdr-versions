Privacy Notice for Professionals and Consumers

This Privacy Notice explains how Eastman Kodak Company _(343 State Street, Rochester, NY 14650_, _USA)_ ("Kodak") uses and discloses personal information. It also applies to those Kodak affiliates, websites, applications, and other digital offerings that link to it. The goal of this Privacy Notice is to inform you of the choices you have about the way the information collected is used.

Additionally:

* On our co-branded sites (such as those sites where Kodak has presented content together with one of our retail partners), a privacy notice unique to that site may be presented.
* Private sites (such as those only available to dealers and distributors) and sites created for our employees (or prospective employees) may also have privacy notices unique to those sites.

Please check the “privacy link” on the bottom of each website to read the privacy information associated with each site. You can also contact the Kodak Privacy Office at [privacy@kodak.com](mailto:privacy@kodak.com) if you have any questions.

Cookies and Online Privacy

When you visit our website, use our mobile applications, or engage with our online ads or email communications, we may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs and web beacons.

In many cases, the information we collect using these tools is only used in a non-identifiable way, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about all website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns. In some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal Information. Our Privacy Notice describes how we use that information when we associate it with your Personal Information. This Cookies and Online Privacy section provides more information about our collection and use of Online and Technical Information.

**_We collect personal information and non-personal information using cookies._** A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a website visitor’s computer or device to uniquely identify the visitor’s web browser and to store information or settings in the browser. You can control cookies by changing your browser’s setting.

Our websites use four kinds of cookies:

* _Strictly necessary cookies_, which are required for our website to operate properly. For example, strictly necessary cookies allow you to set your privacy preferences, log in or fill in forms. Some strictly necessary cookies are used to help ensure the security of our websites.
* _Performance cookies_, which allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
* _Functional cookies,_ which enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.
* _Targeting cookies_, which may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information information, but are based on uniquely identifying your brower and internet device.

When you visit our websites, we will always place strictly necessary cookies. You have choices about performance, functional and targeting cookies. You can use our Cookie Management Platform to control which of these cookies you wish to accept or to reject all non-necessary cookies. If you exercise your rights to tell us not to sell/share your information or to not to use your information for online targeted advertising, we will refrain from placing third party performance cookies and advertising cookies on your browser.

**_Our websites use Pixel Tags._** Pixel tags, also known as tracking pixels, web beacons or clear GIFs, are tools used to transmit information to our service providers’ or partner’s servers. When you visit a website or open an email that contains a web beacon, that tool will instruct your browser to transmit information such as your IP address, device details, time of the activity, and nature of the activity (_e.g.,_ email read, web pages visited) to us. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and to improve our websites. They also enable partners to compile information about your browsing activity on the websites for personalization and online targeted advertising. If you exercise your rights to tell us not to share your information or not to use your information for online targeted advertising, we will refrain from placing pixel tags on your browser.

**_Our websites collect personal information using Server Logs._** A server log is a text file that records activities on our web services. When you visit a website, we log the date and time of your visit, the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. Our server logs also record the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to Kodak and the website you visit after you leave our site. We use this information in aggregate, such as to analyze website traffic patterns and to better understand website user behavior generally. We also use the information for security purposes, to detect threats, and for fraud prevention. For example, we may block login attempts coming from countries where we do not do business. We do not sell or share the information collected by our logs, and we do not use this information for online targeted advertising.

**_Our websites use third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics._** Analytics services help us understand how people use our websites. In some cases, these services are provided by companies that act as service providers for us, meaning that they do not use the information collected for their own purposes. In other cases, the company may combine information collected from users of our websites with information collected from other websites. You have the right to opt-out of having your data combined by these third parties. You can use our Cookie Management Platform to reject all non-necessary cookies. If you exercise your rights to tell us not to sell/share your information or to not to use your information for online targeted advertising, we will also refrain from placing third party cookies on your browser.

While we respect each social media platform’s privacy policies, we may collect personal information about you and your friends if you choose to use these tools. If you engage with our content on or through a social media site, you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g., name, username, email address, profile picture).

Additionally, social media platforms collect persistent identifiers through your browser or mobile operating system, so they may collect information about your use of our websites. If you have previously provided personally identifiable information to these platforms, the platform operators may recognize you here. Your use of social network plugins is subject to each social media site’s privacy policy. For more information, please read the privacy policies posted by the social media platforms that you use.

We may also display interest-based ads to you when you are using social media platforms. These platforms allow us to personalize the ads that we display to you.
