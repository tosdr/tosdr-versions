5. **Information Security**
    
    We have an information security program that is reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality and security of all the personal information that is entrusted to us. Our security safeguards protect against unauthorized access, improper use, alteration, destruction or accidental loss. Our service providers and data processors are also required to implement appropriate security controls by our contracts.

    Where required, we use approved Standard Contractual Clauses and other approved data transfer mechanisms to assure that personal data is adequately protected.

When you interact with another company though these links, that company’s own policy will govern the personal information that you provide. We suggest you review each company’s privacy policies before you submit personal information to them. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these companies.
    
9. **Updates to our Privacy Policy**
    
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We use good faith efforts to post information about material changes at least 30 days before they come into effect.
