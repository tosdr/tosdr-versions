Website Terms of Use
====================

Site Terms
----------

Eastman Kodak Company ("Kodak") operates this Site to provide online access to information about Kodak and Kodak's licensees and the products, Licensed Products, services, and opportunities we provide (the "Service"). **By accessing and using this Site, you agree to each of the terms and conditions set forth herein ("Terms of Use")**. Additional terms and conditions applicable to specific areas of this Site or to particular content or transactions are also posted in particular areas of the Site and, together with these Terms of Use, govern your use of those areas, content or transactions. These Terms of Use, together with applicable additional terms and conditions, are referred to as this "Agreement".

Kodak reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time without giving you prior notice. Your use of the Site following any such modification constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Agreement as modified. The last date these Terms of Use were revised is set forth below.

Use of Site
-----------

You may use the Service, the Site, and the information, writings, images and/or other works that you see, hear or otherwise experience on the Site (singly or collectively, the "Content") solely for your non-commercial, personal purposes and/or to learn about Kodak and Kodak licensee Services. No right, title or interest in any Content is transferred to you, whether as a result of downloading such Content or otherwise. Kodak or its licensees reserve complete title and full intellectual property rights in all Content. Except as expressly authorized by this Agreement, you may not use, alter, copy, distribute, transmit, or derive another work from any Content obtained from the Site or the Service, except as expressly permitted by the Terms of Use.

Copyright
---------

The Site and the Content are protected by U.S. and/or foreign copyright laws and belong to Kodak or its licensees, partners, affiliates, contributors or third parties. The copyrights in the Content are owned by Kodak or other copyright owners who have authorized their use on the Site. You may download and reprint Content for non-commercial, non-public, personal use only. (If you are browsing this Site as an employee or member of any business or organization, you may download and reprint Content only for educational or other non-commercial purposes within your business or organization, except as otherwise permitted by Kodak, for example in certain password-restricted areas of the Site). With the exception of the Sample Images, you may not manipulate or alter in any way images or other Content on the Site.

Kodak and its licensees grant permission for use of Kodak product information (text and images of Services) for catalogs and brochures promoting the sale of Services and for non-commercial research, educational or journalistic purposes such as newspaper and magazine articles and textbooks. All other uses are prohibited. This permission does not cover the right to use the image of any person shown in a product information image. The right to grant such permission belongs to the person shown and Kodak is not able to grant such permission or to give any contact information about the person shown.

Sample Pictures
---------------

Kodak has included Sample Pictures on certain pages within the Site to demonstrate the capability of certain products. You may download, reprint and manipulate the Sample Pictures for this purpose, but you may not crop or change the composition of the image or use the image for commercial purposes. Please read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.kodak.com/en/company/page/frequently-asked-questions/).

Trademarks
----------

You are prohibited from using any of the marks or logos appearing throughout the Site without permission from the trademark owner, except as permitted by applicable law.

Consumer Products
-----------------

Many of the consumer products listed on the Site are sold directly by Kodak's licensees, not by Kodak (“Licensed Products”). These Licensed Products are indicated by the note “The Kodak trademark, logo and trade dress are used under license by xxx licensee.” You acknowledge that Kodak does not sell or resell, nor is Kodak acting as an agent of sale for these Licensed Products. Kodak is simply making it easier for you to buy directly from Kodak licensees. You acknowledge that Kodak disclaims any responsibility for or liability related to such Licensed Products. The risk of loss and title for such Licensed Products pass to you upon the licensee’s delivery of the Licensed Products to a carrier.

Customer Portal
---------------

The portal (“Customer Portal”) and B2B store (“Shop & Orders”) are intended solely for the use of Kodak's business customers ("Customer(s)") who have established a customer relationship with Kodak by entering into a purchase, reseller, dealer, or other appropriate form of agreement ("Customer Agreement") setting forth the terms under which Kodak will sell and the customer may purchase Kodak products and services.

The terms set forth in your Customer Agreement will apply to all orders placed using the Kodak Customer Portal, except as follows:

a. Orders placed through Shop & Orders will be considered "received" by Kodak only after the Shop & Orders has generated and issued to you an order confirmation number. Order confirmation numbers will be automatically displayed by Shop & Orders on the screen immediately after the order has been effectively transmitted to and received by the Shop & Orders service. Order confirmation numbers will also be displayed on Shop & Orders in the record of the order status.

b. Orders will be considered "accepted" by Kodak when the order status displayed on the order status portion of Shop & Orders has been changed to "filling". If Kodak is unable for any reason to accept an order, Kodak will notify the customer in a reasonable period of time.

Orders may not be cancelled through the Shop & Orders service. Contact your customer service representative or refer to your Customer Agreement for additional procedures related to order cancellation.

Availability
------------

Kodak has several websites available in specific regions worldwide. The Services offered in one region may differ from those in other regions due to availability, local or regional laws, regulatory status, shipment and other considerations. Kodak does not make any warranty or representation that a user in one region may obtain the Services available in another region, and a user's order may be cancelled or a user redirect to the site for that user’s region may be cancelled if a user attempts to order Services offered on a site in another region.

Information published on the World Wide Web may contain references or cross-references to Services that are not announced or available in your region. Such references do not imply that Kodak or its licensees intend to announce such Services in your region. Consult your local Kodak business contact for information regarding the Services that may be available to you.

Links to Third-Party Web Sites
------------------------------

Links on the Site to Kodak affiliate or third party (collectively "Third Party\[ies\]") web sites or information are provided solely as a convenience to you. Such links do not constitute or imply an endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation by Kodak of the Third Party, the Third Party web site, or the information contained therein. Kodak is not responsible for the availability of any such Third Party web sites. Kodak is not responsible or liable for any such Third Party web site or the content thereon. If you use the links to these Third Party web sites, you will leave the Site, and will be subject to the terms of use and privacy policy applicable to those Third Party web sites.

Any feedback you provide shall be deemed a Submission under the terms in the User Supplied Information section below.
