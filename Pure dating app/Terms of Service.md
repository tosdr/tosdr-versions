#### 8\. AI-driven chatbot “Goddess”

##### a. Introduction

PURE offers Users the option to engage with an AI-driven chatbot (hereinafter, “**the** **Goddess**”) designed for diverse interactions, ranging from small-talk to deeper conversations, personalized ad suggestions, image generation and other functionalities.

Through chatbot Users can engage in dialogue with a variety of characters. Before initiating a conversation, Users must select one of the characters from a predetermined list. Users can freely change to a different character, however, in this process, they are clearing the conversation history with the current Goddess. When manually clearing the chat history, all previously sent messages will be permanently deleted. Users can communicate with the Goddesses only in the English language. They can request a randomly generated photo from the selected character, reflecting her previously chosen physical appearance and features. 

Taking screenshots of the chat and copying and pasting within the Goddess's input field in chat are prohibited. These features are disabled to ensure the privacy, integrity of the platform and to safeguard associated User’s rights.

##### b. Usage and prohibited conduct

Users should only use the Goddess for engaging in communication in accordance with the PURE’s guidelines and accepted terms. Note that the Goddess is not trained to and does not provide Users with:

* Any kind of advice related to medical care, mental health services, professional health services or emergencies;
* any kind of payment or financial services, advice or guidance;
* any kind of legal advice or representation;
* direct answers from the PURE moderation team or PURE support team. Proper responses regarding account-related issues or inquiries regarding PURE should be directed to the moderation or support team through established channels. Any explanation provided by the Goddess should not be considered binding in any way;
* explanations or interpretations of PURE’s Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, guidelines and other policies. Users should refer to the official documentation or contact PURE’s Customer Support or Legal team for clarification. Any explanation provided by the Goddess should not be considered binding in any way;
* explanations and views on ethical dilemmas. Users should not rely on the Goddess’ answers for resolving ethical dilemmas or moral questions;
* any kind of technical support for troubleshooting issues with PURE; 
* any kind of personal opinion or bias that could be tied to PURE in any way. Responses from the Goddess are generated based on programmed algorithms and do not reflect official stands of PURE, therefore Users should critically evaluate information provided by the Goddess and consider multiple perspectives.

Under no circumstances should Users use or attempt to use the Goddess to generate content or engage in various strictly prohibited activities, such as:

* soliciting and promoting violence, trafficking, gore, hate speech, discrimination of any kind, bullying, zoophilia, paedophilia or creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children;
* engaging and promoting illegal substances, prescription drugs, controlled substances, gambling, online betting, or other illegal or regulated activities;
* requesting assistance in the dissemination of spam, phishing attempts, malware, or other forms of malicious software, and assistance for gaining unauthorized access to electronic devices;
* attempting to obtain or access materials or information that are intentionally not provided by the Goddess. This includes, but is not limited to, modifying, copying, selling, distributing, bypassing any protective measures or safety mitigations, attempting to reverse engineer, decompile or discover the source code or underlying components of the provided features, algorithms or systems;
* seeking guidance or encouragement for self-harm, suicide, or any other form of harm to oneself or others;
* seeking assistance or solely promoting dangerous organizations and movements, extremism, planning or executing illegal activities, such as theft, vandalism and acts of terrorism;
* engaging in deceptive behavior or fraudulent activities, such as identity theft, credit card fraud, or financial scams. This includes misrepresenting responses from the Goddess as human-generated, spreading misinformation, monetizing generated content, impersonating individuals or entities without explicit disclosure and making misleading claims of expertise, particularly in sensitive areas like finance, health or legal matter;
* generating content that may have unfair or adverse impact on individuals, particularly those related to sensitive or protected characteristics, attempting to generate personally identifying information for distribution or other harmful purposes, and tracking or monitoring individuals without their explicit consent;
* encouraging or facilitating copyright infringement, piracy or unauthorized distribution of intellectual property;
* exploiting or persuading Goddess into taking any kind of a stance on a sensitive event with significant social, cultural, political, or exploitative impact, such as civil emergencies, natural disasters, public health crises, conflicts, fatalities, or other tragic occurrences;
* engaging in cyberbullying or harassment by sending abusive or threatening messages to other Users;
* obtaining sensitive information or other kinds of personal information, such as names, email addresses or contact information, from other Users or other parties through social engineering tactics or phishing attempts; 
* Generating sexually explicit content, including but not limited to sexually graphic or pornographic material, consensual and non-consensual sexual acts (such as rape, assaults and violence) and intimate descriptions of sexual acts.

Users should refrain from sharing sensitive personal information with the Goddess, including financial details (such as credit card numbers, bank account information, etc.), passwords, details about their personal life and workplace or any other data that could be exploited by cybercriminals for fraudulent activities. Users should also refrain from disclosing any confidential or proprietary information. The Goddess is designed to not request Users' above-mentioned or other sensitive personal information and Users are strongly advised against sharing any of such information with the Goddess, even if requested by the Goddess to do so.

Users have an option to manually report violations of PURE terms and established guidelines using the “Report” button integrated in the Goddess feature. This functionality not only addresses instances of inappropriate behavior and responses but also contributes to the continual improvement of PURE.

If any content is generated in violation of the above mentioned rules in Article 8 as a result of the User’s input or independent generation process, such content shall be treated as incomplete, incorrect, and/or illegal, and a violation of these Terms and Conditions. It does not constitute binding conduct, advice, representation, or endorsement. As responses and content from the Goddess is generated based on programmed algorithms and do not reflect professional viewpoints, personal opinions or official stands, Users must avoid using it for any purpose that could have legal or material repercussions. PURE holds no liability for the consequences of utilizing or generating such content. Additional information on data processing within the Goddess can be found in our comprehensive Privacy Policy ([here](https://pure.app/content/en/privacy)).

#### 9\. PURE subscription, subscription cancellation, payments

You should know the following about PURE subscriptions and our recurring payments policy when payment is made:

* To access and use all PURE features, you must activate a subscription. You will always be explicitly informed, stating the final prices and duration of the requested subscription and/or individual service(s), before your selected subscription and or individual service is billed through your provided form of payment. Some users might be granted a free subscription based on our discretion and specific internal criteria.
* After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period.
* All payments made to us are final and all charges are non-refundable.

We occasionally provide special offers with discounts. The terms of each offer are described on the page from which the user can proceed to the payment. Terms, discounts, and offers are subject to change or cancellation at any time without notice.

With an active subscription, the promotional price may be valid either for a limited time or indefinitely. In case the obtained promotional price is indefinite with an active subscription, the price will revert to the standard price once you unsubscribe.

If you have an account set up for recurring billing, you may cancel your subscription at any time. To cancel the subscription, you can follow the procedure to turn off auto-renew in your personal account settings in the mobile app under the “Subscription management” section or by clicking the cancellation link in the subscription menu on the web app. Subscriptions can only be canceled on the same platform they were bought on. Cancellations of your subscription will be effective for the following billing period in which payment is due. You will not receive a refund for any payment amount, even if payment was made for multiple billing periods. Deleting the app or your account is not enough to cancel the subscription.

You will continue to have the same access for any billing period or periods for which you have paid. If your User Submissions or your conduct within PURE violates the Agreement, your access and account may be immediately terminated and all payments forfeited. In such an event, no refunds will be issued for either used or unused portions of the subscription period.

Users that reside in the European Union, European Economic Area or United Kingdom are in accordance with Directive 2011/83/EU, Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 or any other applicable consumer laws entitled to a full refund of paid subscription during the 14 days after the purchase of the subscription, without stating the reason for it. 

The following provisions are added to these Terms and Conditions for subscribers living in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin: You, the subscriber, may cancel any order for subscription services, without penalty or obligation, at any time before midnight of the third (3rd) business day after the original date of that your subscribe for such services, excluding Sundays and holidays. To cancel a subscription, mail or email a signed and dated notice that states that you, the subscriber, are canceling the subscription, or words of similar effect. This notice must be sent to PURE at the notice address set forth in Section 23 with the header “Section 8 Cancellation.” Please include your username and email address in any correspondence or your refund may be delayed. If you cancel, we will return, within ten (10) days of the date on which you give notice of cancellation, any payments you have made. If you send or deliver the notice to cancel your subscription within the three (3) day period, we will refund the full amount of your subscription. If you die before the end of your subscription period, your estate will be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription that is allocable to the period after your death. If you become disabled (such that you are unable to use the services of our App) before the end of your subscription period, you will be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription that is allocable to the period after your disability by providing us notice at the address set forth in Section 23. 

Along with the subscription, PURE provides special features, available as in-app purchases that will give certain advantages and improve experience. Users may be able to purchase a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, revocable, limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and personal license to use virtual titles, gifts, coins or any other units that are provided by PURE on the platform and can be exchanged for any other virtual good within the App (collectively, “**Virtual Goods**”). Users can see the balance of Virtual Goods in the settings of their profile, which represents a measurement of the extent of the User's license but does not reflect stored value nor does it constitute a real-world balance. Following the Users' purchase, the foregoing license is revocable, and PURE may terminate the license when an account is terminated or closed according to the provisions of these Terms and Conditions. Users are aware and comply with the fact that PURE will neither refund nor is required to refund purchased Virtual Goods for any reason that may occur (whether in the virtual or physical world), meaning all purchases are **final and non refundable**. 

Purchases of Virtual Goods are **final and non refundable** for users that reside in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK) in accordance with Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EU, Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 or other applicable laws. This policy applies once the performance has begun with users' prior given consent and acknowledgement that the right of withdrawal will be lost, making users' right of withdrawal not applicable. Users therefore acknowledge that their right of withdrawal is waived upon purchase, as the performance commences immediately upon completion of the transaction.

Additionally, PURE will neither provide nor is required to provide a refund or any other compensation for Virtual Goods when the User's account is either voluntarily closed or terminated according to the provisions of these Terms and Conditions. Virtual Goods can be modified, eliminated, controlled, regulated, managed and adjusted in terms of price by PURE at any time at its sole discretion. 

When User's account is terminated according to the provisions of these Terms and Conditions, subscriptions may not automatically be canceled. It is the sole responsibility of the user to ensure that any active subscriptions are canceled manually to prevent the automatic renewal. PURE shall not be held liable for any charges incurred due to failure to cancel subscriptions after an account termination.

Please note that certain subscriptions may be tailored to a specific gender to enhance your experience on PURE. Specifically crafted for different genders, these subscriptions aim to offer customized content and services.

##### **a. Subscriptions, payments and refunds via Apple, Google or Huawei**
