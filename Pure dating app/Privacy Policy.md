#### 1\. Privacy-first approach

We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your Personal Data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. To achieve this, we adhere to the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation. We will only collect and process personal information that is necessary for the specific purposes stated in this policy. Your data will not be used for any purpose other than those disclosed and we will only retain it for as long as required to fulfill these purposes or requests under applicable law.  
We also prioritize transparency and respect for your privacy choices. You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data held by us. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of data protection and user control in order to make PURE a service that people love and trust.

#### 2\. What Personal Data do we collect?

Some of the personal data we collect is mandatory for the provision and functioning of PURE, while other personal data is considered optional, designed to enhance your user experience. Please be aware that without providing the mandatory personal data, we won't be able to grant you access to PURE.

##### **a. When visiting the Website and/or App**

When you visit the Website or App, we can process the following categories of Personal Data from you:

* Technical Data: IP address, operating system, date and time of access, country from which PURE is accessed (based on IP address), browser type, referrer URL, log-in data, and device type;
* Tracking Data: See Article 5 below.

##### **b. When creating an account** 

When you create your PURE account, you voluntarily provide us with certain information. In this way, we can process the following categories of your Personal Data, which are either mandatory or optional for creating account and using PURE:

**Mandatory:**

* Gender (man, woman or non-binary);
* Sexual orientation (heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer or asexual);
* Account data, including User ID.

**Optional:**

* Email address (see Article 8 of this Privacy Policy);
* Identity data, details about your ad (personal description, age, height, spoken languages);
* Sexual and other preferences (turn-ons).

##### **c. When using PURE** 

When you use PURE, you voluntarily provide us with certain information. When you add information to your user profile, interact with us or other users, you make the choice to share your certain personal information with us. In this way, we can process the following categories of your Personal Data, some of which are optional, while others are mandatory to enable you to use PURE to its fullest potential and enhance your overall experience:

 **Optional:**

* Location data, including geographical position, time identifier;

PURE is designed to help you engage with other users located nearby to you. We use your location data (e.g., by using the GPS on your mobile device) to enable the intended functionality of PURE. This will be enabled only if you explicitly give us permission to access your location. You can disable this at any given time by changing the location permissions on your device or in the browser. Please keep in mind that when you use PURE, other users can view your location data and they may use it for purposes you did not intend, or disclose it to individuals or entities outside of our control and without our and your knowledge. The information you provide may be subject to abuse, misuse, and monitoring by others, and you share this information at your own risk.

* Transactional data, including information about the application process, contract content, contract management and execution;
* Financial data, including billing and payment information;
* Pictures, videos, audio and text messages sent when communicating with others (i.e. user’s content and material that have been submitted in the chat conversations, collectively “**User Submissions**”) are processed in order to secure and operate services and keep our user community safe. To ensure user safety, prevention and detection of scams and fraudulent activities, we use automated systems to monitor and review pictures in chat conversations between users. This approach is in strict compliance with data protection regulations and is undertaken to meet the legal requirements imposed by specific countries concerning the transmission of explicit content. For this purpose, pictures and textual User Submissions will be anonymized and stripped of personal information to protect your privacy, thereby ensuring data protection against unauthorized access or disclosure. We will not attempt to re-identify this anonymized data. For more details about this, please see our Terms and Conditions ([here](https://pure.app/content/en/terms));
* Pictures and videos that you upload, publish or provide in any other way. In order to add this kind of content, you first have to give us permission to access your photo album/gallery and/or your camera;
* Information about the images (e.g. metadata), such as the location of a photo and device information. If users choose to share images on PURE and use them in their ads, they also consent to the sharing of metadata related to those images. This serves as a tool for the moderation process, aimed at preventing potential scams and other fraudulent activities. In our commitment to prioritizing users’ privacy, the collected location data is approximate and generalized rather than precise. It is important to note that this data is used solely for moderation purposes and is treated with the utmost confidentiality and security.
* Access to your device's camera and usage of Augmented Reality (“**AR**”) features within PURE that are provided by Snap Inc. and allow an interactive experience that combines the real world and computer-generated 3D content. This access allows the integration of innovative experiences that enhance users' overall engagement, encounter with AR and the option to unlock their full potential for creations.  
    Users will receive a notification with an option to grant explicit consent along with the outlined terms of usage and privacy before accessing this feature. Users must promptly review Snap Inc.’s Privacy Policy ([here](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy)), Snap Inc.’s Terms of Service ([here](https://snap.com/terms)) and Snap Inc.’s Learn More section ([here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012366118676)) before providing explicit consent to accessing AR features on PURE. Users can decline acceptance of Snap Inc.’s terms and block an attempt to activate an AR Lens by tapping on the X button on the provided notification. In the event of such a decline, any subsequent efforts to activate a Lens will prompt the user to review and accept the terms once again. In order to simply revoke given permissions, please change your device settings. Note that this action is limited to device settings and if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
* Usage data, including activity data, online interactions with us and with other users;
* Sexual identity data, including sexual orientation and other sexual preferences (turn-ons and types of connections you prefer);
* Your insights into our products and services, responses and testimonials your provide us when you participate in surveys, market studies or answering questions;
* Information that is used for participation in different contests, events and promotions we provide;
* If you submit report on illegal content under Digital Services Act (DSA) via email, we collect the information that you give us in the form,
* If you contact our customer support team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction, and
* Photographic image of you and your form of identification that can confirm the date of your birth when appealing our decision to revoke your license, authorization to access and/or use PURE and terminate your account for failure to comply with our rules on minimum required age (see more [here](https://pure.app/content/en/terms)).

We receive most of your Personal Data directly from you. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we can also obtain your Personal Data from publicly available sources or from public authorities and other third parties (e.g., service partners, internet analysis services). Personal data we share with third parties is regulated by Article 8 of this Privacy Policy.

#### 3\. How do we use your Personal Data?

We rely on a combination of automated systems and manual reviews to achieve this (see Terms and Conditions ([here](https://pure.app/content/en/terms)) and Article 2).
* Market and opinion research, analytics: We use usage data, activity data, insights, responses, testimonials, interactions, and others to monitor and analyze your use of PURE.

* Legitimate interests: It is necessary to process your Personal Data to pursue our legitimate business interests, provided that your rights and freedoms do not override these legitimate interests, which include but are not limited to ensuring platform security and integrity, operational efficiency, functionality, business development, user safety and overall compliance.
* Compliance with applicable laws and regulations: It is necessary to process your Personal Data to comply with our legal obligations (e.g., accounting, tax, and other statutory data retention obligations); and
* Your consent: If you choose to provide us with Personal Data that may be considered sensitive in certain jurisdictions, you are giving us consent to process that Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

You may withdraw your consent at any given time by contacting us as stated in this Privacy Policy (see Article 14). You can exercise this right at any time and doing so won't affect the legality of processing your data that occurred before the withdrawal, as long as you were informed before giving your consent.

#### 5\. Online tracking and analysis

In any case, an association takes place when you log in to the relevant network after clicking on the link.

#### 7\. Data Transfers to Third Countries

We may transfer your Personal Data abroad to our business partners located in third countries, specializing in Analytics, Data Processing, Business Operations and Data Integration, Content Moderation, Marketing, and App Tracking.

To safeguard your data privacy rights when transferring your personal data to third countries, including those where adequate data protection might not be guaranteed, we use tools such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) - approved by the European Commission and other relevant data protection authorities, Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) and other appropriate mechanism that ensure the personal data transfer complies with applicable laws and regulations. These mechanisms are designed to provide a legal framework for the protection of your personal data during international transfers and demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data protection.

In addition, we ensure that the personal data transfer complies with applicable law, aiming to give your personal data the same level of protection as it has in the European Union and in Switzerland. We carefully assess whether the transfer is based on an adequacy decision, which, as a point of clarification, is an official determination by the European Commission regarding the adequacy of data protection in the third country. Such a determination can simplify data transfers to certain countries. Furthermore, we take into consideration specific safeguards outlined in GDPR Article 46, including Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

When required, we may rely on your explicit consent for data transfers, as stipulated by the provisions of the GDPR, Swiss privacy data regulations, and other applicable regulations. We conduct a comprehensive assessment to safeguard your personal data when transferred to third countries. This reflects our unwavering commitment to protect your data during international transfers and mitigate potential privacy risks. We take your privacy seriously and ensure that such transfers comply with the requirements of these data protection laws and regulations.

#### 8\. Safety and Transparency when sharing User’s Personal Data with Third Parties

In alignment with data protection regulations, we prioritize transparency when it comes to the transfer of your personal data to third parties. This section provides you with essential details regarding such transfers. We may transfer your personal data to carefully selected third parties situated within or outside Switzerland when we have a business reason to engage these organizations.

Once again, we would like to emphasize that we consistently ensure compliance with legal requirements by using up-to-date necessary and recognised mechanisms, guaranteeing the confidentiality and integrity of your personal data's privacy and security throughout its processing and transmission to these third parties.

As we operate on a global scale, the recipient of shared Personal Data and the location data of processing may vary depending on your geographical location and other events. Third parties are located and may process shared data in countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Union (EU) (including but not limited to Ireland, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, France, Germany, Cyprus, and Finland). Additionally, data may be shared to other countries in Europe (including but not limited to the United Kingdom and Russia), as well as to Asia (including but not limited to Israel, India, Vietnam, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong). Furthermore, data processing and sharing extends to third parties in North and South America (including but not limited to the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil) and Australia.

#### 9\. What Personal Data do we share with third parties?

In particular, we may disclose your Personal Data to the following categories of recipients:

* Service providers: We work with trusted service providers that process your Personal Data on our behalf or under joint responsibility (e.g., providers of telecommunications systems, email, database, hosting, outsourcing, payment, user verification, advertising, marketing, analytics, anti-spam, anti-fraud services). These service providers may also use your Personal Data for their own purposes. Service providers provide information about their independent data processing in their own privacy statements.
* Buyers or merger partners: In connection with an actual or potential restructuring of part or all of our business or our assets or any rights or interests therein, we may disclose your Personal Data to potential buyers or merger partners or sellers and their advisors.
* Government agencies and legal representatives: We may disclose your Personal Data to governmental agencies, courts, and other authorities, both domestic and foreign, legal representatives, if we are legally obligated or entitled to do so or if we deem it necessary to do so in order to protect our interests. This includes situations where disclosure would protect  PURE’s, Users', business partners', or other relevant parties' legal rights, mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit, enable us to enforce our agreements with you and accurately address, prevent, or respond to illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other misconduct.

This disclosure aligns with our commitment to transparency, in accordance with relevant data protection laws and regulations. Please refer to the Article 8 of this Privacy Policy for detailed information on data sharing and protection practices.

#### 12\. AI-driven chatbot “Goddess”

PURE offers Users the option to engage with an AI-driven chatbot (hereinafter, “**the Goddess**”) designed for diverse interactions, ranging from small talk to deeper conversations, personalized ad suggestions, image generation, and other functionalities. For more detailed information regarding the rules, purpose, limitations, prohibited content, and behavior please refer to our Terms and Conditions ([here](https://pure.app/content/en/terms)). Users' engagement with the Goddess indicates consent to data collection and usage as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

##### a. Data collection

When Users engage with the Goddess, PURE may collect and store certain information to improve the user experience and provide personalized interactions, such as text messages exchanged between the User and the Goddess. Collected data is properly stored in our database to prevent any kind of unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse. Users can choose to delete their chat history with the Goddess on their device by either reinstalling the app or logging out and logging back into the existing account. However, Users' inputs will be saved for a certain period and when no longer required, they will be permanently deleted according to the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Under no circumstances will PURE ever share Users’ inputs, collected data, and/or generated content for marketing or advertising purposes.

We may utilize data collected through conversational exchanges between the User and the Goddess to refine and enhance the performance and functionality of the Goddess at certain phases of its development. This ensures that responses and generated content are personalized and tailored to meet the specific needs, expectations, and inquiries of our users. 

A limited number of PURE’s personnel may manually access, review, and utilize Users' inputs to refine and enhance the Goddess, as deemed necessary for its development process, or to comply with legal obligations. The extent of this depends on the development and implementation phase of the Goddess, therefore it may not occur consistently. It's important to note that our competent personnel’s access is limited to information essential for improving the Goddess’ performance. This strict control ensures Users' privacy and confidentiality as no identifiable personal data, which Users may have provided in the process of registration or usage of PURE, is or will be employed in training the Goddess.

The Goddess does not have access to Users' personal data which was provided according to Article 2 of this Privacy Policy and it won’t request it. Users should refrain from disclosing any sensitive personal data, confidential or proprietary information. Note that the Goddess is designed to not request Users' above-mentioned or other sensitive personal information and Users are strongly advised against sharing any of such information with the Goddess, even if requested by the Goddess to do so.

##### b. Third party providers

We collaborate and share certain content with third-party service providers specialized in AI model development and infrastructure that enable us to deliver a seamless experience of the Goddess to Users. These service providers are subject to data privacy, security and confidentiality obligations, and their own data policies. It is important to understand that we share only essential and minimal data necessary for the performance of the Goddess. This ensures that no identifiable or any kind of personal information from Users is disclosed or shared in this process. Rest assured, we require that these third parties take reasonable measures for anonymization of received data and refrain from attempting or re-identifying it, thereby ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

#### 13\. How do we secure your Personal Data?

We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, or alteration. Our employees and the service providers commissioned by us are contractually obliged to maintain confidentiality and to comply with the provisions of data protection law.

However, it is not possible for us to guarantee the absolute security of Personal Data. In this context, please note that data transmitted over an open network such as the Internet or an email service is openly accessible. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of messages or content shared over these networks. Thus, Personal Data sent to us via open networks will not be subject to the same security measures as Personal Data contained within PURE.

#### 14\. Your rights

You have the following rights:

* Access: You have the right to access your Personal Data. This gives you the opportunity to check what Personal Data we process about you and that we process it in accordance with the applicable data protection regulations.
* Rectification: You have the right to have inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data rectified and to be informed of the rectification. In this case, we will inform the recipients of the data concerned of the adjustments made, unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

* Restrict processing: You have the right, under certain conditions, to request that the processing of your Personal Data be restricted.

    You can file a complaint in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work, or where you consider that the processing of your Personal Data is not in compliance with the GDPR. If you need additional information about the appropriate supervisory authority for filing complaints, please contact us.
* Withdrawal: You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Data at any time, free of charge, and without giving any reason by contacting us at the address provided in this Privacy Policy. Processing activities conducted with your consent in the past, prior to you withdrawing consent, do not become unlawful as a result of your withdrawal. 

Please note that the above-mentioned rights are not absolute. These rights are subject to exceptions and their applicability is largely dependent on the legal basis we rely on in each case and the various circumstances of each specific request.
