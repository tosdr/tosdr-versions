This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Collect Call, LLC d/b/a Pesology ("Pesology") collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from its customers and users of its Website (each, a "User"). The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you about what kinds of information we, at Pesology, may gather about you, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of the information.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Pesology does not own or control, or to people that Pesology does not employ or manage. This includes any companies from whom you may have ordered services or products that are transmitted over Pesology's mobile or billing platform, and any companies from whom you may be purchasing other services.

Pesology is committed to safeguarding the information Users entrust to Pesology. This Website is not directed at children under 18 years of age.

#### Collected Information

Pesology may collect various types of personal information including name, mobile telephone number, address, zip code, billing information, that, either alone or in combination with other kinds of information, may personally identify Users. Pesology may collect personally identifiable information from Users in a variety of ways, including through online forms for ordering products and services, and other instances where Users are invited to volunteer such information.

#### Mobile-Specific Information We Collect

Most of the personally identifying information we collect is what you tell us about yourself. For example, certain of our products and services allow you to interact and share personal information and data with others. You choose what you want to share and how you want to share it.

Sometimes, we record your phone number. We record your phone number when you send it to us; ask us to remember it; or make a call or send a text message or Short Message Service (SMS) to or from Pesology. If you ask us to remember your phone number, we will associate your phone number with your account ID based on your device and hardware IDs; so if you change your device or hardware, you will have to re-associate this new device or hardware with your account before we can authenticate you.

Most of the other information we collect for mobile, such as your device and hardware IDs and device type, the request type, your carrier, your carrier user ID, the content of your request, and basic usage stats about your device and use of Pesology's products and services does not by itself identify you to Pesology, though it may be unique or consist of or contain information that you consider personal.

Certain of our products and services allow you to download and/or personalize the content you receive from us. For these products and services, we will record information about your downloads and preferences, along with any information you provide yourself.

For products and services with voice recognition capabilities, we collect and store a copy of the voice commands you make to the product or service. To improve processing of your voice commands, we may also continuously record in temporary memory a few seconds of ambient background noise. This recording stays only temporarily on the device and is not sent to Pesology.
