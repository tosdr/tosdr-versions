Our security measures are regularly upgraded and tested to ensure they are effective. We take the following specific steps to protect your information:

Use internal access controls so only limited personnel have access to your information. Anyone with access to user information is trained on all relevant security and compliance policies. Servers that store visitor information are regularly backed up to protect against loss. All information is secured through modern security technologies like secure socket layer (SSL), encryption, firewalls, and secure passwords.

All access safeguards described above are in place to prevent unauthorized access by outsiders to information stored on or transmitted by our systems.

Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights. We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.

For example, we may send you promotional communications or updates about our Services and Products, subject to your right to control whether we do so.
