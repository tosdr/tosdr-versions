    From chatbots to deepfakes, AI-generated content is becoming increasingly common online. New AI tools make it easier, faster and cheaper to generate text, images, videos, and more. In turn, the harms that have always existed online – scams, harassment, polarisation and bias – are now being “supercharged” by AI.

    We need to rethink how we deal with information in the context of crises. All of us, really. We, the digital users of the digitised information world, need to get a grip on things. How we explore the world, what and who we trust, and why, in the context of crises, has gotten too far out of our hands and needs to change. We need a place to come together. We need to reinvent how we talk about and solve difficult things while respecting any fundamental differences we might come to the table or screen with.

    We are in the business of developing tools that allow us to eat our own tail, and AI is the new big mouth that we have just invented to help us with this self-consuming task incredibly effectively. In this spiral of self-consumption, everything tastes the same - it is impossible to verify sources and provenance and impossible to separate disgusting opinions from facts. It seems that fiction is much more popular than non-fiction in this reading club of self-consumers.
