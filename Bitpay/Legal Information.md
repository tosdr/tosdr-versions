### Who are the data subjects?

There are several types of data subjects whose personal data we process:

* **Legitimate interest.** In most cases where we process personal data in the context of our Services we rely on our legitimate interests in conducting our normal business as an online payments company as a legal basis for such processing.

* Identification documents (such as a passport or a driver's license)
* Proof of address document (such as a bank statement or a utility bill)

Collection of personal data: The Merchant will confirm your BitPay wallet address so that you can receive the Payout.

6\. Employees of Partners

Categories of personal data: We process data about former, existing and prospective vendors and customers, including Merchants (together, “Partners”). This includes limited personal data about employees and agents of such Partners (“Partner Employees”) at the beginning and throughout the course of the Partner relationships. We may process:

* Professional contact information (e.g., name, postal address, email address, fax number, phone number, mobile phone number)
* Professional information (e.g., profession and title, place of work, and relationship to our Partner)

Collection of personal data: We may collect personal data from you, your employer or colleagues. In very limited cases, it may be a contractual requirement for us to collect such personal data from Partner Employees (for example, because the Partner Employee is a designated “point of contact” and if this information is not collected, it could result in a breach of contract by us or the Partner.)

Specification of legitimate interests. Prior to processing your personal data on the basis of legitimate interests, we have assessed whether our legitimate business interests are not overridden by your rights and freedoms. You can contact us for information about the ‘balancing test’ that we conducted to rely on this legal basis. Please find our contact details below.

### How we protect and store personal information

We take the security of our data seriously. We use administrative, technical, and physical security designed to safeguard personal data in our possession, and we maintain internal policies and procedures to address our data security. We have been audited and received a SOC 2 report addressing the security of our Services. However, we cannot guarantee the security of the data that we collect and store. We will notify relevant supervisory authorities and data subjects in the event of a data breach, if required under applicable law.

### Data retention

In principle, we do not store your personal data any longer than is strictly necessary for processing purposes. We have a retention policy to ensure that your personal data is retained and deleted in accordance with applicable retention periods. Because we are a regulated financial institution in the United States, we retain personal data collected as a part of our customer due diligence and identification program, as required by applicable federal and state regulations.

For further information on our data retention policy, please find our contact details below.

### How we share personal data with third parties and transfers outside the EEA

Third parties. We may share your personal data with the following third parties:

* Other BitPay entities, including to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about our products, services and communications;
* Service providers who help with our business operations and to deliver our Services, such as:
    * Cloud service providers providing cloud infrastructure;
    * Providers of ID verification solutions and other due diligence solutions (such as KYC and anti-money laundering);
    * Providers of website analytics;
    * Providers of customer service solutions outside of the EEA;
    * Providers of marketing automation platforms in the United States
* Law enforcement, government officials, regulatory agencies, our banks, and other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, court order or other legal process or requirement if applicable to BitPay; or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of data is necessary to report suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to investigate violations of our Terms of Use; and
* We may also share certain Shopper data with our Merchants, for example, in cases of suspected fraud or in connection with an ongoing investigation.

Transfers outside the EEA. BitPay is primarily located in the United States, and some of the third parties mentioned above may be located in the United States or other countries outside the EEA. We employ the following safeguards if the processing of personal data by us qualifies as a transfer of personal data outside the EEA and falls within the scope of the GDPR:

* We may transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection of personal data
* We may use specific contracts, including Standard Contractual Clauses. For example, we offer Standard Contractual Clauses to meet data transfer requirements in respect of third parties such as service providers

You can obtain a copy of such contracts or information about countries in which we have service providers by contacting us. Please find our contact details below.

### Your rights

Under the GDPR and relevant implementation acts, individuals have statutory rights related to their personal data. For more information on your rights, please refer to this web page of the European Commission. Please note that rights are not absolute and may be subject to conditions.

One key right is the **Right to object**. You have the right to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on legitimate interests as our legal basis (see above). Under certain circumstances, we may have compelling legitimate grounds that allow us to continue processing your personal data. Insofar as the processing of your personal data takes place for direct marketing purposes, including profiling for direct marketing, we will always honor your request.

Other rights are as follows:

* **Right to withdraw consent.** Insofar as our processing of your personal data is based on your consent (see above), you have the right to withdraw consent at any time.
* **Right of access.** You have the right to request access to your personal data.
* **Right to rectification.** You have the right to request rectification of the personal data that we hold about you.
* **Right to erasure.** You have the right to request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances.
* **Right to restriction.** You have the right to request restriction of processing of your personal data.
* **Right to data portability.** In some cases, you have the right to request to transfer your personal data to you or to a third party of your choice.

How to exercise your rights. The exercise of the aforementioned rights is free of charge and can be carried out by visiting our Data Subject Rights Portal. (You can also contact us by email via the contact details below, but you will receive a reply email directing you to our Data Subject Rights Portal so it is easier to go straight to our portal).

Merchants can review and edit their personal data by logging into their account and reviewing their personal data under the Settings tab on their Merchant dashboard. If you wish to change information relating to your industry or company website, or if you wish to close your account, you can submit a request at https://support.bitpay.com. If you choose to close your BitPay account, we will mark your account in our database as "closed". We will retain the information in the account in accordance with the record retention principles outlined in this Privacy Notice and as required by applicable law.

### Marketing

If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad customization programs, you can simply click the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of an email you receive from us or you can send an email to [marketing@bitpay.com](mailto:marketing@bitpay.com).

### Contact Information

Contact DPO. BitPay has appointed a Data Protection Officer. You may contact us with questions or concerns about our privacy policies or practices at [dpo@bitpay.com](mailto:dpo@bitpay.com). However, If you wish to submit a data privacy rights request, you may do so by visiting our Data Subject Rights Portal.

Complaints. Subject to applicable law, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority. If you believe we maintain your personal data within the scope of the GDPR, and if you believe we did not take action in respect of your data subject rights (as set out above) or you are not satisfied with the way in which we have handled your request, you may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority or seek a judicial remedy. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) is BitPay’s lead supervisory authority in the EU. However, we would always appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please contact our Data Protection Officer with questions or concerns by sending an email to [dpo@bitpay.com](mailto:dpo@bitpay.com) or mail to: BitPay B.V., the representative of BitPay Inc. in the EU:
