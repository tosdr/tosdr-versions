This Cookie Policy describes the different types of cookies that may be applied by BitPay Inc. on its website (“Site”). We may change this Cookie Policy at any time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

If you have questions regarding this Cookie Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO) at [dpo@bitpay.com](mailto:dpo@bitpay.com) or write to us at BitPay Inc., Attention: Data Protection Officer, Stadsplateau 7 WTC office 73521 AZ, Utrecht, Netherlands.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are a standard feature of websites that allow us to store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to a website. Cookies help the website owner learn which areas of the website are useful and which areas need improvement. Cookies also improve your experience by, for example, remembering your preferences, such as your language preference or login information.

Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for a website to operate, also known as "Strictly Necessary" cookies. Some cookies allow a website to count visits and traffic sources so the site owner can measure and improve the performance of the site, also known as “Analytics” cookies. Some cookies enable a website owner to serve targeted advertisements, also known as “Targeting” cookies.

### What cookies do we use?

Our Site uses both first party cookies (which are set by us) and third party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our Site) for several reasons. The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Site and the purposes they perform are described in the tables below.

**Analytics Cookies.** These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources to our Site so we can measure and improve the performance of our Site.

They may be used by us or our marketing partners to understand which parts of our Sites are of interest to you and/or show you relevant advertising on our Site or on other Sites. They do not store personal data, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

### Web beacons

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site or opened an email that we sent. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Site to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether a user came to our Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

### How do I manage cookies?

You can choose whether to accept our cookies (except Strictly Necessary Cookies) by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links in our Cookie Preference Center, which can be found in our Site’s footer and cookie banner. You also have the right to refuse or accept cookies at any time by activating settings on your browser. You may wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html for information on commonly used browsers.

Note that blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience on our Site and the services we are able to offer you.
