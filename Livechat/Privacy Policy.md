We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data that We collect and process about you against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. While processing Personal Data We take into due account the risk involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, We cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. We cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of your Personal Data or any information you disclose or transmit to us. We are not responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access, and We make no warranty, express, implied or otherwise, that We will prevent such access, and We are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law.

We only keep the information that's needed for its original purpose, what you've allowed us to use it for, or what the law or our Agreement with you permits. We won't hold onto it any longer than necessary, unless there are legal or contract reasons to do so. When We use your data to improve our Services or develop new ones, we remove any details that can directly identify you. We focus on general trends, not individual details about you.

Speaking about retention, We keep data only as needed, following your authorization or legal requirements.

6\. Data transfer compliance

We take careful steps to legally transfer data across borders and ensure that your data receives suitable protection regardless of geography.
