5\. How we secure your information and how long do we keep your information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1. Security. Text, Inc. will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data that We collect and process about you against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. While processing Personal Data We take into due account the risk involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, We cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. We cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of your Personal Data or any information you disclose or transmit to us. We are not responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access, and We make no warranty, express, implied or otherwise, that We will prevent such access, and We are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law. Where required under law, We will notify you of any such loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Data that may affect you so that you can take the appropriate actions. We also may occasionally contact you to determine that your Personal Data is still accurate and current.

5.2. Retention. We will only collect and retain your data which is relevant to the purposes for which it is collected, subsequently authorized by you, or if otherwise permitted by law or by the Agreement. This means that We retain your data for only as long as it is necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected and limit the storage period to the minimum necessary, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or the Agreement. When We retain information for the improvement and development of our Engagements or new products/features, We take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and We only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Engagements, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.

Legal stuff made easy

We work hard to make sure your personal information is kept safe and accurate. We use various methods to protect your data from being lost, misused, or accessed without permission.

Even though We have protections in place, we can't guarantee total safety, especially online, from intrusion by others and We can't promise your data is 100% invincible. If someone does get unauthorized access,  and it affects data subjects, We'll let you know ASAP so you can take action, if needed. This is why you should also take standard precautions protecting your data, your credentials and access to the Account. We'll notify you of significant data breaches as required. 

We only keep the information that's needed for its original purpose, what you've allowed us to use it for, or what the law or our Agreement with you permits. We won't hold onto it any longer than necessary, unless there are legal or contract reasons to do so. When We use your data to improve our Services or develop new ones, we remove any details that can directly identify you. We focus on general trends, not individual details about you.

Speaking about retention, We keep data only as needed, following your authorization or legal requirements.

6\. Data transfer compliance
----------------------------

Text, Inc. operates globally, which means your data may be processed outside of your country. We take careful steps to legally transfer data across borders and ensure that your data receives suitable protection regardless of geography. We may need to transfer your Personal Data to our authorized partners outside of your jurisdiction, including outside the European Economic Area (EEA), USA, the United Kingdom, and in countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and that may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. 

We will only transfer data to our authorized partners who need the information in order to provide services to or perform some activities and only for a purpose consistent with this Privacy Policy or the Agreement.
