4\. Tracking Techniques and Technologies and Targeted Advertising
=================================================================

Tracking Techniques and Technologies

We and our third-party business partners use various tools and technologies such as cookies, pixels, localStorage, web beacons, software development kits, and similar technologies (collectively, “**Tracking Technologies**”) to collect data when you interact with our Products and Services, including our websites, mobile applications, and email communications. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). 

Our Products and Services use Tracking Technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website can access Personal Information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that Product or Service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Products and Services, such as pages you have visited, and Content you viewed or searched for. We may also use these technologies to save your preferences, consent, and choices; determine if you opened or interacted with our emails or newsletters; troubleshoot and resolve technical issues or outages; conduct research; deliver editorial Content and advertising; maintain subscription and registration information; and store information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis. Additionally, we may use these technologies to collect analytics and measure the use of our Products and Services.

The use of these Tracking Technologies helps us serve you better by understanding what you are interested in, track trends, measure the effectiveness of ads, conduct frequency capping, and tailor offers about our Products and Services to you. We also allow specific, approved third-party business partners and/or service providers, including Google Analytics, to collect data from your browser or device for Targeted Advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes using their own similar tools. For more information about Google Analytics including how to opt out, visit [How Google Uses Information](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en-US) and to [Opt-out of Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

We and our third-party business partners may also use these Tracking Technologies to gather Personal Information, including Sensitive Personal Information, about how you view and use our Products and Services and to connect your activity with other data we maintain about you. 

Targeted Advertising and Identity Resolution Partners

We and our third-party business partners may collect and share Personal Information about your online and offline activities over time and across unaffiliated websites and mobile applications to predict your preferences and interests, and, in conjunction with third parties, may use your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising and to serve advertising believed to be of interest to you ("**Targeted Advertising**").

We may collaborate with our service providers and our third-party **Identity Resolution Partners** to deliver Targeted Advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Products and Services. We and these **Identity Resolution Partners** facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use Personal Information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity and Device Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser. 

For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, who may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers also help us with fraud detection and security, to enforce our User Agreement, verify user authentication for accessing Content behind a paywall, and to determine eligibility for offers available exclusively to new subscribers, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and which are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You can Opt-Out of Identity Resolution Partner LiveRamp’s use of your Personal Information for these purposes by visiting [https://optout.liveramp.com/opt\_out](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out), or, as described in the [Opting Out of a “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information or of its Use for Targeted Advertising](https://stage.condenast.com/privacy-policy#opting-out)  section below. 

As noted in the Social Media Company Integration section above, we may utilize Tracking Technologies to disclose information about your use of our Products and Services to social media companies and other third-party business partners to serve you and other segments of users Targeted Advertising and to facilitate marketing communications. 

We and our advertising partners may make inferences about your interests and these inferences may be used for Targeted Advertising. In certain U.S. states, these inferences may be considered Sensitive Personal Information. When we obtain this information from our third-party business partners, we will, where required by law, contractually ensure that they have obtained your consent or offered you an opportunity to opt out before sharing it with us. Similarly, if we collect Sensitive Personal Information directly from you, where required by law, we will obtain your consent, provide you an opportunity to opt out, or take other appropriate action. For more information about your rights regarding Sensitive Personal Information under local laws, please refer to the [Exercising Your Privacy Rights, Including the Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising](https://www.condenast.com/privacy-policy#exercising-your-privacy-rights) section below.

7\. Exercising Your Privacy Rights, Including the Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising
==========================================================================================

To exercise your rights under applicable local law, or if, in accordance with applicable local law in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, Utah, Oregon, Texas, and Montana, you are an authorized agent, or a parent or guardian seeking to exercise rights on behalf of a minor, please follow the instructions provided below.

Opting Out of a “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information or of its Use for Targeted Advertising

Please note that when following the processes described below, you may need to make your Opt-Out choices on **each website, mobile application, browser, and device that you use**, and if your browser’s cookies are cleared, you may need to repeat the process. However, if you have created an account to log in across several of our apps and/or websites, we will make reasonable efforts to apply your opt-out request to each of those apps and websites.

* To exercise your right to opt-out of our “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information, the use of your Personal Information for Targeted Advertising purposes, or to limit our use and disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information (collectively "**Opt-Out")** on our websites and mobile applications, where such choices are available to you under applicable local law:
    * Click on the “Your Privacy Choices” button/link, typically located in the footer of our brand (such as The _New Yorker, Vogue_, or _Wired_) website or in the settings/about menu of our brands’ mobile applications. Please then follow the instructions on the applicable “Your Privacy Choices” webpage, which may request that you slide a toggle switch or submit a form to effectuate your choice.
    * As noted above, your choices are specific to the browser, website, mobile application, and device you are using. Although we will make reasonable efforts to apply your opt-out request across several of our apps and/or websites if you have created an account to log in across several of ours apps and/or websites, this generally means that:
        * If you accessed the “Your Privacy Choices” button/link from the website or mobile application of a Condé Nast brand, such as _The New Yorker, Vogue,_ or _Wired_, when you make your Opt-Out choice following the process described above, the Opt-Out will only be applied on the specific brand’s website. If you want to Opt-Out on our other websites, you will need to go to that website, access the “Your Privacy Choices” button/link and follow the Opt-Out process described above.  
        * If you access the “Your Privacy Choices” button/link from our corporate site condenast.com, and follow the process described above, you will only be Opted-Out from the corporate website and will need to go to a specific brand website(s) that you wish to Opt-out from and follow the process described above. 
        * If you intend to Opt-out from condenast.com and not from one of our brand websites or mobile applications, you can click [Your Privacy Choices](https://www.condenast.com/privacy-policy#footer) or follow the process described above on the condenast.com website. 
* We also recognize Global Privacy Control as valid opt-out method. Certain browsers and browser extensions support [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) which sends a signal to websites indicating your choice to Opt-out of the use of your Personal Information for Targeted Advertising and “sales” or “shares” as defined under applicable law. We honor the GPC and where required by law, similar user-initiated browser based opt-out preference signals. Note that the Global Privacy Control is currently only applicable to opt-outs from websites. For mobile apps, please follow the instructions above.
* To Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising enabled by other uses of your Personal Information, such as by LiveRamp, an Identity Resolution partner, visit  [https://optout.liveramp.com/opt\_out](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out). 
* To Opt-out of “sales” or “sharing” such as when your name and mailing address is used in connection with list rental and data co-ops, fill out this <[form](https://condenast-privacy.my.onetrust.com/webform/c7543215-252a-4de7-a3a9-a93c52733953/83e47630-f69a-4596-b30b-80a452b68688)\> or call 1-888-914-9661 and use PIN 867 610.
* Google uses Tracking Technologies and Activity and Device Information in combination with information they maintain to show you Targeted Advertising on our websites and mobile apps. For more information about this including how to opt-out of the use of certain of these Tracking Technologies, please visit the [Google Advertising Privacy Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US).
* Do Not Track (DNT). Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal to websites and online services that you visit. Since there is no consensus about what DNT means in this context and how to implement DNT signals, like many other businesses, our websites do not respond to these DNT signals, but you have the options noted above and below to make choices about how your Personal Information is used.

We may ask you or your authorized agent for supplemental information as needed to establish your identity. Authorized agents may also be required to provide a copy of the consumer’s signed permission authorizing the agent to submit requests on the consumer’s behalf under applicable local law.

You may have a right to appeal a decision we make relating to requests to exercise your rights under applicable local law. To appeal a decision, please contact us our Privacy Policy Coordinator by [emai](mailto:privacy_administration@condenast.com)l or as described in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy. 

Financial Incentive

By providing us your Personal Information, such as your email address, to register or otherwise create an account on our websites or mobile apps we may give you access to Content that would otherwise require a paid subscription (“Program”). California and other states may consider this Program to be a financial incentive or loyalty program. Personal Information you provide to us as part of this Program may be used for Targeted Advertising and disclosed to our Identity Resolution Partners, as described in this Privacy Policy. You retain all rights that you otherwise have, including to Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising, and to make requests about your Personal Information, and any such requests will not affect your access to or participation in the Program, including if you leave the Program. You may withdraw from the Program at any time by logging into your account or emailing our Privacy Policy Coordinator at [privacy\_administration@condenast.com](https://www.condenast.com/privacy_administration@condenast.com).

The value of the Personal Information you provided is reasonably related to the benefits you get from the Program and includes the value of your access to our Content; our costs to provide you with the Content and to collect and process your Personal Information; and the potential benefits, such as additional advertising revenue and improvements we can make to our Products and Services through the Program.

California Online Erasure

California’s "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code §§ 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of content they post. If you fit that description and posted Content on a section of our Products and Services that is directed to California residents at least 13 and younger than 18 years of age, you may request removal of the content by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by [emai](mailto:privacy_administration@condenast.com)l or as described below. In response to your request, we may elect to make the content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the content.

  

8\. Opting Out of Marketing Communications
==========================================

If you do not wish to receive future marketing or other commercial messages from us, follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the message you receive. Note, however, that you may continue to receive certain communications from us that are necessary for the Products and Services, such as renewal notifications, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative service bulletins.

  

9\. Retention
=============

We will retain Personal Information from or about you as reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose(s) for which the Personal Information was collected or processed as outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.

  

10\. Security of Your Personal Information
==========================================

We implement physical, technical, and organizational security measures designed to safeguard Personal Information. These measures aim to protect the Personal Information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no measures can guarantee security.

  

11\. Third-Party Links
======================

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites and applications. Any access to and use of such linked websites and applications is not governed by this Privacy Policy but is instead governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites and applications. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites and applications. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party websites or applications that you choose to visit.

  

12\. Publicly Posting Personal Information
==========================================

Please be aware that Personal Information and Content that you disclose in publicly accessible portions of the Products and Services may be available to other users and may also be made available outside the Products and Services by third parties, so you should be mindful of all Personal Information, especially Sensitive Personal Information, that you may wish to post. Where required by applicable local law, we may ask you to obtain consent from any individual before posting that individual’s Personal Information on our Products and Services.

  

13\. International Transfers
============================

Your Personal Information may be processed, transferred to, and maintained on servers and databases located outside of the jurisdiction in which you are based and where the privacy laws may not be as protective as your jurisdiction.

For more information on the appropriate safeguards in place, please contact us as noted in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy. 

Where required by applicable local law, our legal bases for processing your Personal Information are as follows: 

* **Performance of a contract:** We process Personal Information where necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations to you. For example, to provide the Products and Services to you, including where you make a purchase, enter a sweepstakes, sign-up to attend an event or conference, or engage in another transaction with us. 
* **Compliance with legal obligations:** We process Personal Information where necessary to comply with the legal obligations to which we are subject. For example, to cooperate with public and government authorities, courts, or regulators in accordance with our legal obligations, to the extent this requires the processing or disclosure of Personal Information to protect our rights. 
* **Legitimate interests:** We process your Personal Information where necessary to serve our legitimate business interests when those interests are not outweighed by the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. For example, to ensure that we can effectively manage and communicate regarding our business, to perform investigations or compliance audits, to improve the Products and Services, to exercise or defend our rights, and for business administration purposes. You can contact us using the details in the Contact Us section below for information about how we assess whether we are permitted to use your Personal Information under this legal basis.

If we have obtained your consent, you may have the right to withdraw your consent under applicable local law. To exercise this right, please contact us as noted in the Contact Us section below.

As noted above, our Products and Services are not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our systems.

We do not have actual knowledge of selling or sharing the Personal Information of consumers that are younger than 16 years of age. To the extent we have actual knowledge that a consumer is at least 13 and less than16 years of age, we will request affirmative authorization from the individual before selling or sharing the Personal Information, to the extent required under applicable local law.

  

15\. CCTV
=========
