------------------------------------------

1\. Scope of the processing of personal data

RWTH Aachen University processes personal data of visitors of the site only insofar as this is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our contents and services. The collection and processing of the personal data of our users take place only with the user's consent. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for practical reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.

2\. Legal basis for the processing of personal data

Insofar as RWTH Aachen University obtains the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as a legal basis.

In the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as a legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual activities.

As far as the processing of personal data is required for the fulfilment of responsibilities which are carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e GDPR serves as a legal basis for this processing.

3\. Deletion of Data and Duration of Storage

The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to exist. Furthermore, data may be stored if this is required by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the controller is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned regulations expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract.

XII. Rights of the data subject
-------------------------------

If any of your personal data is being processed, you are considered a data subject according to the GDPR. Thus, you have the following rights vis-a-vis the person responsible:

1\. Right to information

You can ask the responsible person to confirm whether your personal data is or will be processed by RWTH Aachen University.

If your data is being processed, you can request the following information from the person responsible:

1. the purposes for which the personal data is processed;
2. the type/categories of personal data being processed;
3. the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been and/or will be disclosed
4. the planned duration of storage of your personal data or, if specific information in this regard cannot be provided, criteria that determine the storage period;
5. the existence of a right to rectification or deletion of personal data concerning you as a user, a right to limitation of processing by the controller, or a right to object to such processing;
6. the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority;
7. any available information on the source of the data if the personal data is not collected from the data subject;
8. the existence of automated decision-making including profiling in accordance with Art. 22 para. 1 and 4 GDPR and – at least in these cases – meaningful information on the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject.

You have the right to request information as to whether the personal data concerning you is transferred to a third country or to an international organization. In this context, you may request to be informed of the appropriate guarantees pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR in connection with the transmission.

This right to information may be restricted in so far as it is expected to make the realization of research and statistical purposes impossible or severely limits it, and this restriction is necessary for the fulfillment of the research or statistical purpose.

2\. Right to demand correction

You have a right of rectification and/or completion vis-à-vis the person responsible if the personal data processed concerning you are incorrect or incomplete. The person responsible shall make the correction without delay.

This right to information may be restricted in so far as it is expected to make the realization of research and statistical purposes impossible or severely limits it, and this restriction is necessary for the fulfillment of the research or statistical purpose.

3\. Right to limitation of processing

Under the following conditions, you may request that the processing of personal data concerning you shall be restricted:

1. if you dispute the accuracy of the personal data relating to you for a period that enables the data controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
2. the processing is unlawful and you refuse to delete the personal data and instead request that the use of the personal data be restricted;
3. the data controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you do need them to assert, exercise or defend legal claims, or
4. if you have filed an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR and it has not yet been determined whether the legitimate reasons of the person responsible outweigh your reasons.

If the processing of personal data relating to you has been restricted, such data may only be processed – aside from being stored – with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending rights or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or on grounds of an important public interest of the Union or a Member State.

If the processing restriction has been restricted according to the above conditions, you will be informed by the person responsible before the restriction is lifted.

This right to information may be restricted in so far as it is expected to make the realization of research and statistical purposes impossible or severely limits it, and this restriction is necessary for the fulfillment of the research or statistical purpose.

4\. Right to deletion

a) Duty to delete

You may request the data controller to delete the personal data relating to you without delay, and the controller is obliged to delete this data without delay if one of the following reasons applies:

1. The personal data relating to you are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
2. You revoke your consent, on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, and there is no other legal basis for the processing.
3. You file an objection against the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, and there are no overriding legitimate reasons for the processing, or you file an objection against the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 2 GDPR.
4. The personal data concerning you have been processed unlawfully.
5. The deletion of personal data relating to you is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member States to which the data controller is subject.
6. The personal data relating to you have been collected in relation to information society services offered pursuant to Art. 8 para. 1 GDPR.

b) Information to third parties

If the data controller has made the personal data concerning you public and is obliged to delete it pursuant to Art. 17 para. 1 GDPR, he or she shall take appropriate measures, including technical ones, and taking into account the available technology and the implementation costs, to inform those who are responsible for processing the personal data that you as the data subject have requested the deletion of all links to this personal data or of copies or replications of this personal data.

c) Exceptions

The right to cancellation does not exist insofar as the processing is necessary

1. to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;
2. for the performance of a legal obligation required for processing under the law of the Union or of the Member States to which the controller is subject, or for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority conferred on the controller;
3. for reasons of public interest in the field of public health pursuant to Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h and i and Art. 9 para. 3 GDPR;
4. for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 para. 1 GDPR, insofar as the law referred to under a) is likely to make it impossible or seriously impair the attainment of the objectives of such processing, or
5. to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

5\. Right to information

If you have exercised your right to have the data controller correct, delete or limit the processing, he or she is obliged to inform all recipients to whom the personal data relating to you have been disclosed of this correction, deletion or restriction on processing, unless this proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.

You have the right, vis-à-vis the data controller, to be informed of these recipients.

6\. Right to data transferability

You have the right to obtain the personal data concerning you that you have provided to the data controller in a structured, common and machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to pass this data on to another data controller without obstruction by the data controller to whom the personal data was made available, provided that

1. processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR and
2. processing is carried out by means of automated methods.

In exercising this right, you also have the right to request that the personal data concerning you be transferred directly from one data controller to another data controller, insofar as this is technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons must not be compromised by this.

The right to transferability shall not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority conferred on the controller.

7\. Right of appeal

You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you under Article 6 para 1 lit e or lit. f GDPR; this also applies to profiling activities based on these provisions.

The data controller no longer processes the personal data relating to you, unless he or she can prove compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

If the personal data concerning you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of the personal data relating to you for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is associated with such direct marketing activities.

If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data concerning you are no longer to be processed for these purposes.

You have the opportunity – notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC – to exercise your right of objection in connection with the use of Information Society services by means of automated processes using technical specifications.

In addition you have the right, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to object to processing of personal data relating to you, which are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89 Art. 1.

This right to information may be restricted in so far as it is expected to make the realization of research and statistical purposes impossible or severely limit it, and this restriction is necessary for the fulfillment of the research or statistical purpose.

8\. Right to revoke the data protection declaration of consent

You have the right to revoke your declaration of consent concerning data protection at any time. The revocation of consent shall not affect the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of your consent until revocation.

9\. Right of appeal to a supervisory authority

Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, if you believe that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR, you have the right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state where you reside, work, or where the supposed infringement took place.

The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the status and results of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 78 GDPR.

The competent supervisory authority for RWTH Aachen University is the Landesbeauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit NRW (State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information) \[[https://www.ldi.nrw.de/](https://www.ldi.nrw.de/)\].
