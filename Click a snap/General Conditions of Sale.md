ClickASnap is devoted to providing a high-quality service to all of its members. If, for whatever reason, you are not satisfied with your purchase, then please review our refund & cancellation policy below to understand your rights as a consumer and as a member of ClickASnap.

ClickASnap is a UK-based company, and thus our Refund & Cancellation Policy falls in line with the United Kingdom’s Consumer Rights Act (2015).

ClickASnap’s Refund & Cancellation Policy is applied in line with our Terms of Service, and your entitlement to a refund depends on whether you have remained in line with our Terms of Service throughout the lifetime of your membership with us.

[](#our-products)Our products

ClickASnap is a complex platform that offers a variety of services. We first need to understand what our services are categorized as for you to understand what you are entitled to.

ClickASnap offers digital services and content in the form of memberships and their relevant benefits, as well as digital downloads. Digital services/content is defined by the Consumer Rights Act (2015) as "data which are produced and supplied in digital form."

ClickASnap also offers products for purchase within our shop feature, which are subject to the Sales of Goods Act, under the Consumer Rights Act (2015).

[](#consumer-rights)Consumer rights
-----------------------------------

Under the Consumer Rights Act (2015), all products and digital services must be of satisfactory quality (according to the expectations of a reasonable person), fit for purpose, and provided as described at the time of purchase.

Should you have concerns that the service or product you have received is not of a satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, or as described at the time of purchase, it is your responsibility as the consumer to prove that the digital service or product was faulty at the time it was supplied.

[](#clickasnaps-refund-policy)ClickASnap’s Refund Policy
--------------------------------------------------------

ClickASnap does not offer a cooling-off period for any of its services or products, and all sales are final. Should the consumer have reasonable concerns that the digital service or product purchased has not been of satisfactory quality (according to the expectations of a reasonable person), fit for purpose, or provided as described at the time of purchase, then they must contact customer support within thirty days of their purchase detailing the reasons for their concerns and providing proof to support their concerns.

A consumer’s refund request will then be reviewed and handled on a case-by-case basis at ClickASnap’s sole discretion, acting in line with the Consumer Rights Act (2015). As aforementioned, ClickASnap is a complex platform with a variety of services. Below you will find categories into which these services can be summarized and details as to how refund requests regarding the below are handled. Should your refund request be for any reason other than the above (not of satisfactory quality according to the expectations of a reasonable person, fit for purpose, or provided as described at the time of purchase), then the refund request will be reviewed solely against the below policy rules.

### [](#monthly-memberships)Monthly memberships

Upon the purchase of a monthly subscription, the relevant membership is immediately applied to your account, and the included features come into effect immediately and will continue for the full duration of the subscription's current term (i.e., the paid-up-to date). With this in mind, you are not automatically entitled to a refund, pro-rata or full, when canceling mid-term. You are entitled to reactivate your account at any stage once the current subscription term has ceased.

### [](#annual-memberships)Annual memberships

Upon purchase of an annual membership, this is immediately applied to your account, and the included features come into effect immediately and will continue for the full duration of the subscription's current term (i.e., the paid-up-to date). We do not consider refunds (full or pro-rata) for the early cancellation or downgrading of annual subscriptions. This is partially due to the discount the consumer receives compared to paying monthly, alongside the ability to trial a membership on a monthly subscription basis.

### [](#auto-renewal)Auto-renewal

All of our memberships auto-renew, whether it has been purchased on a month-by-month or an annual subscription basis. This is advised to the consumer at point of purchase, and the next payment date due is also detailed within the consumer’s account settings. It is the consumer’s responsibility to cancel or downgrade their accounts when they intend to. ClickASnap will not consider the reimbursement of subscription payments in instances where the consumer intended to, but did not, cancel their subscription prior to their subscription auto-renewing.
