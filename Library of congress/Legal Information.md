> The Library of Congress's mission is to engage, inspire, and inform Congress and the American people with a universal and enduring source of knowledge and creativity. Our vision is that all Americans are connected to the Library of Congress. Our websites offer public access to a wide range of information, including historical materials that are products of their particular times, and may contain offensive language or negative stereotypes.

General Disclaimer
------------------

Materials displayed on our websites are intended for reference use only. Our websites link to other federal agencies’ and other organizations’ websites when there is a business reason to do so. The links are not endorsements of the content of the websites, or of their policies or products.

Security
--------

To maintain the security of our websites, and to ensure that they remain available to you, we use software programs to monitor network traffic. The programs identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, deny service, or otherwise cause damage or access non-public information. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the United States criminal code (18 U.S.C. 1030). We may provide information about possible violations of the law to law enforcement officials.

We reserve the right to block IP addresses that fail to honor our websites’ robot.txt files, or submit requests at a rate that negatively impacts service delivery to patrons. Current guidelines recommend that software programs submit a total of no more than 10 requests per minute to our applications, regardless of the number of machines used to submit requests. We also reserve the right to terminate programs that require more than 24 hours to complete.

The community of security researchers plays an important and vital role in information technology (IT) security. The Library of Congress welcomes reports from security researchers, and encourages researchers to report any vulnerabilities they discover in Library web applications as soon as possible. [This page](https://www.loc.gov/legal/vulnerability-disclosure-program/) provides a set of public rules and guidelines for researchers to report potential vulnerabilities in the Library’s public-facing websites and how the Library will work with a researcher after a vulnerability has been validated.

About Copyright and the Collections

As a publicly supported institution, we generally do not own the rights to materials in our collections.
