Privacy policy
==============

We are F95zone ("we", "our", "us"). We’re committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. If you have questions about your personal information, please [contact us](https://f95zone.to/pages/contact/).

Privacy
-------

For your peace of mind, we would like to ensure that under no circumstances will your email or personal information be shared with or distributed to anyone without your explicit consent. Your privacy is extremely important to us. Please be mindful not to share your email publicly when posting, as the site allows user contributions and posts.

Joining only requires an email address, which serves as the only unique & reliable identifier for our users. We ask for no other identifiers. You are permitted to change your “display name” at any time; however, your login will always be your original registered email. There are no “name” fields, so you are not required or encouraged to use your real name, nor submit any other personal information, address, or phone number.

We do not know your password. It is stored in an encrypted hash. You may [reset your password anytime](https://f95zone.to/lost-password/), and we have recently removed the restriction of forcing very strong passwords when resetting. Once logged in, the account/settings page allows you to change your password.

Users may voluntarily enter their city (or country) on their profile card to let other users know where they are located – purely for interest's sake and no other reason. It is beneficial to know when someone is from another country, enabling us to translate our communications into their native language. We strongly encourage an international community, as we are multilingual ourselves.

Naturally, some basic and general information (such as browser type, device, and IP address, etc.) is occasionally logged along with any submissions for visitor & statistic purposes. These logs are essential for gaining a general understanding of our audience and assist in debugging, depending on the browser/device you’re using.

However, it’s important to note that in specific circumstances, particularly in compliance with our CSAM policy or when legally required, we may be obligated to provide certain information to authorities. We take our legal responsibilities seriously while striving to protect your privacy to the fullest extent possible.

Data Retention Policy
---------------------

We retain your personal information for a period of 50 days to provide you with our services. After this period, personal data is securely deleted from our systems unless we are obligated to retain it longer for legal reasons, particularly in relation to our CSAM policy. Our retention policy is designed to respect your privacy while ensuring we meet our legal and ethical responsibilities.

Children’s Privacy & CSAM
-------------------------

Our services are not directed to children under the age of 18. We take the protection of children's privacy very seriously and comply with all applicable laws and regulations on child protection. For detailed information on our stance and actions against Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), please refer to our dedicated CSAM Policy at [F95Zone CSAM Policy](https://f95zone.to/help/csam/).

Forum Registration
------------------

Registration is necessary to participate and post in our forum. A registration form should be filled out completely with your desired username, password, and email address. Your email address will be used to verify your membership and contact you about forum-related concerns. We process and store the information collected on this website securely and in accordance with applicable privacy laws. We do not share any personally identifying information with outside third parties without your consent, except as required by law.

Forum User Information
