Content Disclaimer
------------------

The content available on F95Zone ("the Service") is intended for general information and entertainment purposes only. Our primary goal is to support and highlight the creative works of game developers and artists to a wide audience. F95Zone does not claim ownership of any content featured unless explicitly stated otherwise.

The information, images, text, and any other content, including third-party links, are widely available on the Internet. We endeavor to credit the original authors, developers, and publishers accurately. All downloadable content linked from F95Zone is hosted by third-party services outside of our control, shared by individuals or groups unknown to us. F95Zone does not directly distribute or sell any content – our Service acts solely as a reference point to existing information and sources.

F95Zone, along with any associated service providers, assumes no responsibility for how the content is used or misused by visitors and users. We are not liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, or incidental damages arising from the use of the Service. Content on F95Zone is subject to change, addition, or deletion at any time without notice. We do not guarantee that the website is free from malware or harmful components.

External Links
--------------

F95Zone may feature links to external sites not maintained by us. We do not endorse the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information on these external websites. F95Zone holds no responsibility for the content found on linked external sites.

Age Restriction
---------------

Content on F95Zone may be considered adult in nature and unsuitable for minors. We discourage the use of our Service by individuals under the legal age in their respective countries. If you are not of legal age, please exit the website immediately.

Content of a Sensitive Nature
-----------------------------

Some content on F95Zone may reference taboo or controversial subjects. It is essential to understand that all content is fictional and does not depict real events or individuals. While we support freedom of expression and artistic liberty, we firmly oppose and do not endorse any form of violence or abuse against any living being. We comply with civilized morals and state laws, strictly prohibiting child pornography and any acts of abuse or violence. Should any content offend you, we encourage you to contact the respective developer or publisher with your concerns.

Compliance with 18 U.S.C. 2257
------------------------------

All sexually explicit content on F95Zone is created using specialized software and does not involve real individuals. Therefore, our Service is exempt from the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 2257 Record Keeping Requirements. Visual depictions of actual human beings engaged in explicit conduct displayed on this website are of persons who were at least 18 years of age when those visual depictions were created. All other visual depictions are exempt from record-keeping requirements as they are either created before July 3, 1995, depict only simulated sexually explicit conduct, or involve non-sexually explicit nudity. F95Zone and its operators are not the primary producers of any visual content contained within.
