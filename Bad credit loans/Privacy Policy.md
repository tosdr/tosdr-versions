What We Do
----------

### How do we protect your personal information?

To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with applicable law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.

### Why can’t you limit all sharing at the time you submit a loan request?

However, you can contact us at any time after you submit your loan request to limit all sharing.
