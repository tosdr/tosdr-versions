**I. MYCASE TERMS OF SERVICE**

Last Updated: May 10, 2024

Welcome to MyCase! Please carefully review these MyCase Terms of Service (these “Terms of Service”), as they contain important information about your legal rights, remedies and obligations. When these Terms of Service mention “MyCase”, “we”, “us”, or “our”, it refers to MyCase, Inc. By subscribing to or using any of our Services (as defined below), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service.

These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement between you and MyCase governing your access to and use of the Services. Your access to and use of the Services are also governed by (i) the terms set forth in your order form and/or online sign-up flows, (ii) the MyCase Payments Terms, (iii) the MyCase Website Terms, and (iv) any other policies applicable to your use of the Services that we make available, each of which is incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.

MyCase respects your privacy. Please consult our [Privacy Policy](https://www.mycase.com/privacy-policy/) for more information on how we collect, use and share your personal information for our own purposes (but note that our Privacy Policy is not a part of these Terms of Service and may be changed from time to time). By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you acknowledge and consent to the collection, use, sharing and disclosure of your personal information and data as described in our Privacy Policy, as may be modified from time to time.

**1\. Scope of Services**. We offer, through our proprietary software as a service platform, a suite of online legal practice management hosted software services, which includes our core legal practice management software solution as well as certain value-added services to which you may subscribe (collectively, the “Service(s)”). To subscribe to a Service, you must complete an online sign-up flow, which identifies the Service to which you have subscribed, additional subscription terms, and the fees payable by you to MyCase for that Service. By subscribing to the Service, you may access and use the Service for the purpose of managing your legal practice. You are only entitled to use the Services for which you have subscribed and paid, and your use of the Services is subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service. We reserve the right to modify the Services (or any part thereof) from time to time and we are not liable to you or to any third party for any modification of the Services.

1.1. Intended Use. The Service is designed and intended to be used by licensed attorneys and legal professionals in the United States. Your use of the Service for any other purpose or in any other manner is at your own risk.

1.2. No Legal Advice. MyCase does not provide legal advice and is not engaged in the practice of law.

1.3. Expanding the Services. You may subscribe to additional Services, including any new value-added services made available by MyCase from time to time, or increase your existing subscription by executing an order form or completing an additional online sign-up flow, as applicable. Each new sign-up flow will include the price and billing date(s) of the Services being added at that time. All new Services are subject to these Terms of Service.

1.4. Set-Up and Configuration. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriate set-up and configuration of the Services. In the event you request we provide assistance in the set-up or configuration of the Services, without in any way limiting Section 8.2, we make no representations or warranties with respect to any changes we may make or work we may perform on your behalf and at your request.

**2\. Modification of These Terms of Service**. We work constantly to improve our Services and develop new features to make our Services better for our customers. As a result, we may need to change these Terms of Service from time to time to accurately reflect our Services and practices. If we do, those revised Terms of Service will supersede prior versions. Unless we say otherwise, changes will be effective upon the “Last Updated” date located at the top of this page. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. We will provide you advance notice of any material changes to these Terms of Service. For any other changes, we will publish the revised Terms of Service and update the “Last Updated” date above. We hope that you will continue to use our Services, but if any changes materially impact you or your business and you object to any changes, you may terminate your subscription to the Services according to the terms herein. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of any revisions.

**3\. Customer Support**. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide complimentary technical support services to you and your authorized users of the Services. Unlimited cases are accepted from authorized users. Our standard support is available Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, excluding major holidays, which include Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day. You may contact customer support by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.mycase.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or calling us at (800) 571-8062.

**4\. Training**. We will make available remote, live or recorded training sessions to you and your authorized users, as well as provide tutorials which are accessible via the Help Articles and Training Sessions sections of our website at no additional charge.

**5\. Your Rights and Restrictions**.

5.1 Authorization to Use the Services. Subject to (i) your timely payment of all fees set forth in the online sign-up flow and (ii) your compliance with these Terms of Service, we authorize you, on a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and limited basis, to use (and permit your authorized users to use) the Services to which you have subscribed solely for your internal business purposes in accordance with Section 1.1 (Intended Use) above.

5.2 Authorized Users. You (i) are responsible for your authorized users’ compliance with these Terms of Service, and (ii) will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Services. If the authorized status of a user changes, it is your responsibility to promptly remove such user’s access to the Services . Third parties that compete directly with us are not permitted to access or use the Services or any application programming interface we may make available to you. We reserve the right to disable or delete access to the Services and any application programming interface for any of your authorized users that we deem to be direct competitors, as determined in our sole discretion.

5.3 Your Responsibilities. Use of the Services In Compliance With Laws. The Services contain various tools and workflows that assist you in the conduct of your business. For example, you may be able to use the Services to, among other things, text, email, and accept payments from individuals. Such activities can be highly regulated, and while we assist you in carrying out such activities, you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account or by your authorized users. Without limiting the foregoing, you will (i) have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of all data that you submit to the Services; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized control or tampering or any other unauthorized access to, or use of, the Services and notify us immediately of any unauthorized use or security breach; (iii) comply with all applicable local, state, federal, and foreign laws (including laws regarding privacy and protection of personal or consumer information) in using the Services; and (iv) obtain and maintain all computer hardware, software and communications equipment needed to access the Services and pay all access charges (e.g., ISP fees) incurred by you in connection with your use of the Services. By agreeing to MyCase Terms of Service, you are hereby subject to Twilio’s Terms of Service which can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/legal/tos). Subject to and in accordance with Twilio’s Acceptable Use Policy and Messaging Policy, you are responsible for maintaining compliance and may incur financial penalties for non-compliance with the aforementioned policies. Fines for any violation of the below restrictions include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Tier 1: $2,000: Phishing (including simulated phishing set for security testing or similar purposes), smishing, and social engineering. Social Engineering is a technique used to manipulate someone into sharing private information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
* Tier 2: $1,000: illegal content (content must be legal federally and in all 50 states)
    
* Tier 3: $500: all other violations in commercial messaging including but not limited to, messages containing a reference to SHAFT (sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, and tobacco) that do not follow federal and state law and regulations (e.g. age-gate).
    

These non-compliance fines apply to violations across any messaging products (SMS/MMS) and non-delivery of messages could result.

5.4 Your Restrictions. You may not, and you will ensure your authorized users do not, (i) disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to decipher any code in connection with the Services, or modify, adapt, create derivate works based upon, or translate the Services; (ii) license, sublicense, sell, rent, assign, distribute, time share transfer, lease, loan, resell for profit, distribute, or otherwise commercially exploit, grant rights in or make the Services or any content offered therein available to any third party; (iii) use the Services except as expressly authorized under these Terms of Service or in violation of any applicable laws; (iv) engage in any illegal or deceptive trade practices with respect to the Services; (v) circumvent or disable any security or other technical features or measures of the Services or any other aspect of the software or, in any manner, attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or its related computer systems or networks; (vi) use the Services to transmit infringing, libelous, obscene, threatening, libelous, or otherwise unlawful, unsafe, malicious, abusive or tortious material, or to store or transmit material in violation of third-party privacy rights; (vii) use the Services to store or transmit any viruses, worms, time bombs, Trojan horses and other harmful or malicious code, files, scripts, agents or programs or to send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of applicable laws; (viii) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services or third-party data contained therein; (ix) use any robot, spider, or other automated device, process or means to access, retrieve, scrape or index any portion of the Services; or (x) reformat or frame any portion of the Services.

Although we have no obligation to monitor your use of the Services, we may do so at our discretion and may prohibit any use of the Services we believe may be (or is alleged to be) in violation of these Terms of Service or applicable laws and regulations.

5.5 Reservation of Rights. No other rights are granted except as expressly stated in these Terms of Service, and nothing herein conveys any rights or ownership or license in, or to, the Services or any underlying software or intellectual property. We own all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Services and the underlying software, and any and all updates, upgrades, modifications, enhancements, improvements or derivative works thereof, and in any idea, know-how, and/or program(s) developed by us or our authorized users during the course of performance of the Services.

**6\. Term and Termination**.

6.1 Term. The term of the Services will be agreed to in the online sign-up flow you complete, and shall automatically renew for successive one (1) month or one (1) year terms, as set out in the online sign-up flow, unless we discontinue the Service or you provide us with notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.

6.2 Termination. Either party may terminate any subscription to Services (i) if the other party breaches any of its obligations under these Terms of Service and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the non-breaching party, or (ii) if the other party becomes insolvent or bankrupt, liquidated or is dissolved, or ceases substantially all of its business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may terminate your subscription to the Services immediately in the event of your material breach of these Terms of Service, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Upon termination of your subscription, you will immediately discontinue all use of the Services, cease to represent that you are a user of the Services, and destroy all our Confidential Information (as defined in Section 9 below) in your possession. Neither party will be liable for any damages resulting from a valid termination of any subscription(s) to Services; provided, however, that termination will not affect any claim arising prior thereto.

6.3 Handling of Your Data in the Event of Termination. You agree that following expiration or termination of any of your subscriptions to the Services, we may immediately deactivate the affected Services and that, following a reasonable period, we may delete your account and data. However, in the event that the Services are terminated by us, we will grant you temporary, limited access to the Services, not to exceed thirty (30) days, for the sole purpose of permitting you to retrieve your proprietary data, provided that you have paid in full all undisputed amounts owed to us. You further agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any termination of your access to the Services or deletion of your data, provided that we are in compliance with the terms of this Section 6.3.

**7\. Fees**.

7.1 Service Fees. You will pay certain non-refundable fees for the Services in the amount set forth in the online sign-up flow (the “Service Fees”) and according to the billing frequency stated therein. Service Fees are due and payable on the date of the invoice. Service Fees are charged on a per authorized user basis. We may increase Service Fees from time to time by providing you with no less than thirty (30) days advance notice; provided, however, the Service Fees for any Service subject to a fixed term, will only be increased at the time of renewal of your subscription to such Service. Service Fees are non-refundable if you terminate your subscription early.

7.2 Billing. All subscriptions to the Service come with an initial free trial period. If you do not provide your credit/debit card information (“Card Details”) to MyCase within the free trial period, your account will be suspended and may only be reactivated by submission of valid Card Details. MyCase will have no responsibility for any loss of access to or use of the Services or your data or other information stored in or by the Services during such suspension period. If you provide valid Card Details before the end of your free trial, and have elected to continue with a paid plan, you will be billed either monthly (at the end of the trial period) or annually, at your option. Regardless of your billing cycle, there are no refunds or credits for (i) partial months or years of Services, (ii) users with their authorization revoked from your account, or (iii) unused time with an open account. In order to treat all of our customers equally, no exceptions will be made. For any changes to your plan (e.g., different billing cycles, additional authorized users, etc.), your credit/debit card will be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle; provided, however, if you elect to add additional authorized users to your account prior to the date of renewal for your Services (the date you add additional authorized users being referred to herein as the, “User Add Date”), the Service Fee applicable to such additional users will be prorated as of the User Add Date and your credit/debit card will be charged such prorated amount on the User Add Date. Additional charges or increased fees may apply on a going forward basis for customers with an exceptionally high number of authorized users, an unusually high monthly ticket rate per agent, or extraordinary usage of bandwidth, in which case we will notify you in advance to provide you with a reasonable opportunity to modify your use of the Service or terminate your subscription to avoid any additional charges or increased fees.

7.3 Additional Fees. You may incur certain other non-refundable fees or charges for your use of the Services, including certain value-added services, in addition to those fees set forth in the online sign-up flow (the “Additional Fees”). Any Additional Fees will be set forth in the additional online sign-up flow for such service.

7.4 Late Payments. You acknowledge that your failure to pay any Service Fees or Additional Fees when due may result in suspension or termination of your subscription to the Service. If you fail to pay any of the fees or charges due hereunder, MyCase reserves the right to, among other things, engage an attorney or a collections agency to collect the delinquent fees and charges. You agree to pay all fees and costs incurred by MyCase in connection with the collection of such delinquent amounts, including without limitation, any and all court and related costs, attorneys’ and/or collections agencies’ fees plus interest in an amount equal to the lesser of 1.0% per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

7.5 Taxes. You are responsible for all sales tax, use tax, value added taxes, withholding taxes and any other similar taxes and charge of any kind imposed by federal, state or local governmental entity on the transactions contemplated by these Terms of Service. When we have the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which you are responsible pursuant to this Section, the appropriate amount will be invoiced to and paid by you unless you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.

**8\. Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer**.

8.1 Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that (i) you have all necessary authority to enter into and perform your obligations under these Terms of Service without the consent of any third party or breach of any contract or agreement with any third party; and (ii) you will use the Services only for lawful purposes in accordance with these Terms of Service and any and all applicable MyCase policies and guidelines made available to you.

8.2 Disclaimer of Warranties. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, IN LAW OR FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USE OF TRADE, AS TO ANY MATTER, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THE SERVICES WILL MEET ALL OF YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” BASIS AND YOUR USE OF SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE AGREEMENT.

We have no liability or obligation with respect to any costs or damages claimed under Section 10.1 if the Infringement Claim arises out of or is in any manner attributable to (i) any modification of any Services by you (or any of your authorized users), or (ii) use of Services in combination with services and products not provided by MyCase if such infringement would have been avoided without such modification or combination, or (iii) our compliance with your designs or instructions(each an “Excluded Claim”).

If you apply for the ACH Services, you are responsible for completing and submitting an initial written application and supporting documentation about your business and financial status.

If we approve your application, we shall make available the ACH Services. You shall utilize and access the ACH Services solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the policies and guidelines we make available to you from time to time.

Subsequent to your initial acceptance and provision of the ACH Services, we may from time to time request you provide updated information and supporting documentation to confirm your then-current business and financial status, which you shall deliver to us within three (3) business days of our request. Any failure to provide such information and supporting documentation within a timely manner or failure to satisfy our then-current underwriting criteria (as determined in our sole discretion) will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and result in the termination of your right to use the ACH Services.

To serve in this role, we must enter into agreements with Card Brands, other processors and banks. These third parties may require that our customers enter into an agreement with Processor. If you are such a user, we will provide you a “Merchant Services Agreement For Sub-Merchants” that you must execute in order to use the Card Services.

2.5 Applicable Card Brand Rules & Laws. The Card Brands require that you and we comply with their applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations, and any other program or requirement that may be published and or mandated by the Card Brands (“Card Brand Rules”).

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree to the following:

You are prohibited from (i) assessing a surcharge for the use of a card in connection with any transaction, or (ii) dispensing cash on any card transaction.

The Card Brand Rules may contain provisions that affect your legal rights, including arbitration agreements, jury and class action waivers, limitations of liability, indemnification obligations, and more. By accepting payments initiated with Card Brands you agree to such provisions.

If you permit recurring transactions, you must (i) obtain your customer’s consent to periodically charge the customer on a recurring basis for the services purchased; (ii) retain this permission for the duration of the recurring services and provide it upon request to us, Processor or the issuing bank of your customer’s Card; and (iii) retain written documentation specifying the frequency of the recurring charge, the duration of time during which such charges may be made and the amount or range of amounts that may be charged. You must not submit any recurring transaction after receiving: (a) a cancellation notice from your customer (so long as such notice was timely provided at least three (3) days prior to the transaction date); or (b) notice from us, Processor or any Card Brand that the Card is not to be honored.

By accepting these terms, you authorize Processor to hold, receive, and disburse funds via credit and debit entries to your designated bank accounts on your behalf. Your authorization permits Processor to generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to process each payment transaction that you authorize. Your authorization will remain in full force and effect while you use the Card Services.

2.7 Your Authorization For Fee Assessment. You agree to pay the applicable fees in connection with your transactions for card payments and other payment methods (“Fees”). You also grant us Recovery Authorizations, (Recovery Authorizations include your authorization of MyCase to debit, charge, setoff against and otherwise recover funds) which we may utilize to recover fees you owe us. Subject to MyCase Terms of Service and these Payment Terms, we reserve the right to change the Fees upon reasonable advance notice. All balances and all Fees, charges, and payments collected or paid through the Payment Services are denominated in US dollars. Note that Fees associated with other payment methods, such as ACH, are subject to separate fees.

In addition to the Fees, you are also responsible for any penalties or fines imposed, in relation to your MyCase Account, on you by any Association, Card Brand, Member Bank, Merchant Supplier, or Processor resulting from your use of MyCase payment services in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or any other rules and regulations you are subject to by using MyCase payment services.

You are also obligated to pay all taxes, customs, duties, fees and other charges imposed by any governmental authority (“Taxes”), including any value added tax, goods and services tax, provincial sales tax and/or, harmonized sales tax, and/or withholding tax on the MyCase payment services provided under this Agreement.

You agree MyCase is not responsible for assessing, collecting, reporting, or remitting any Taxes on MyCase payment services provided under this Agreement and/or on any payments or payouts you make to any third party through the MyCase payment services.

By accepting these terms, you authorize us to assess all applicable transaction fees from your designated Account. Your authorization permits us to generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to process such fee payments. Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect while you use the payment processing services.

2.8 Restricted Use. You shall only complete and present for processing sales transactions produced as the direct result of bona fide sales made by you to cardholders, and you are expressly prohibited from presenting sales transactions which are produced as a result of sales made by any person or entity other than you, or for any purposes related to any illegal or prohibited activity, including but not limited to money-laundering or financing of terrorist activities.

2.10 Account Deposits. Subject to the payout schedule below, Processor will deposit to your Account the amounts actually received by Processor for transactions submitted through the Service. Once your bank account information is verified, Processor will automatically deposit your money in your designated bank account. Funds for any given transaction will not be deposited until the transaction is deemed complete. Transactions will be deemed complete when Processor has received or sent the funds and when Processor or the designated financial institutions have accepted the transaction or funds. You are responsible for monitoring your transactions and ensuring that our payments to you, via Processor, are correct. You must notify us of any errors in payments made to you within thirty (30) days of the error first appearing on your electronic transaction history. Failure to notify us of such an error will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.

2.11 Standard Payout Schedule. Once you validate your Account, we, via Processor, will automatically initiate a payout to your Account for any transactions received on your behalf at the end of every business day. Payouts to your Account will normally register within 1-2 business days.

2.12 Availability of Funds. Should we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your Account, we may defer payout or restrict access to your funds for the entire time it takes for us to do so. We also may defer payout or restrict access to your funds as required by law or court order, or if otherwise requested by law enforcement or governmental entity.

2.13 Your Account History. When a payment is made to your Account, we will update your Account activity on the Services and provide you a transaction confirmation. The confirmation will serve as your receipt. Summaries of your account activity are available through the Services. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for (i) compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Account and your use of the Service, and (ii) reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your Account. If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity is associated with your Account, you agree to contact us immediately.

2.14 Receipts. You must make a written receipt available to your customers for any transaction greater than fifteen dollars ($15.00). You may give your customers the option to receive or decline a written receipt. As a convenience, but not in lieu of a written receipt, you may also offer electronic receipts for delivery through email to your customers.

2.15 Customer Service. You are solely responsible for all customer service issues relating to your services, including pricing, order fulfillment, order cancellation by you or customer, returns, refunds and adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, technical support, and feedback concerning experiences with your personnel, policies or processes. In performing customer service, you will always present yourself as a separate entity from us.

2.16 Refunds and Returns. By accepting payment card transactions through the Service, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, your services through your account in accordance with these terms and the Card Brand Rules. Card Brand Rules require that you will (i) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (ii) disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase, (iii) not give cash refunds to a customer in connection with a card sale, unless required by law, and (iv) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a card sale refund. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the customer for postage that the customer paid to return merchandise. Please be aware, if your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the buyer, you may still receive a chargeback relating to such sales.

You can process a refund through your Account up to sixty (60) days from the day you accepted the payment. If your balance is insufficient to cover the refund, we will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested refund amount from your bank account. Processor will then withdraw the amount you were paid from your bank account, and credit it back into your customer’s card. We and our Processor have no obligation to accept any returns of any of your services on your behalf.

2.17 Your Liability for Chargebacks. The amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your account (a “chargeback”) if the transaction (i) is disputed, (ii) is reversed for any reason by the Card Brand, Processor, or a payer’s or our financial institution, (iii) was not authorized or we have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or (iv) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of these terms.

2.18 Our Collection Rights for Chargebacks. Processor may deduct the amount of any chargeback and any associated fees, fines, or penalties assessed by the Card Brand from your Account, any proceeds due to you, your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with us. If you have pending chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your Account. Further, if we reasonably believe that a chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, Processor may withhold the amount of the potential chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under these terms until such time that: (i) a chargeback is assessed due to a customer’s complaint, in which case Processor will retain the funds; (ii) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (iii) we determine that a chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we, via our Processor, are unable to recover funds related to a chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of all account deficit balances unpaid by you. You hereby authorize Processor to charge the amount of daily chargebacks from your Accounts that originally received the relevant payment amounts by making an ACH debit from your Account.

2.19 Excessive Chargebacks. If we determine that you are incurring an excessive amount of chargebacks, we may establish controls or conditions governing your account, including without limitation, by (i) establishing new processing fees, (ii) delaying payouts, and (iii) terminating or suspending the services.

2.20 Contesting Chargebacks. You agree to assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Service. Towards that end, you permit us to share information about a chargeback with the payer, the payer’s financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the chargeback. If the chargeback is contested successfully, we will release the reserved funds to your account. If a chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Card Brand or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the chargeback, we may recover the chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these terms. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within fifteen (15) days of our request, may result in an irreversible chargeback. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating chargeback disputes.

2.21 Our Set-off Rights. To the extent permitted by law, we, and our Processor, may set off against the balances for any obligation you owe us under these terms, including without limitation any chargebacks. Any fees assessed in association with a transaction will be deducted from your designated Account.

2.22 Our Processing Errors. We will attempt to rectify processing errors that we discover. If the error resulted in your receipt of less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, we will credit your account for the difference. If the error results in your receipt of more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, we will debit the extra funds from your account. We will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error. Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty (30) days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.

2.23 Card Data Security and Access to Cardholder Data. You agree to the confidentiality and security requirements required by the Card Brands including, but not limited to, the following:

In addition, you agree that you will not (i) use Cardholder Data for any purpose other than to support card payments for your services, (ii) use the Cardholder Data for any purpose that you know or should know to be fraudulent or in violation of any Card Brand Rules, or (iii) sell, purchase, provide or exchange in any manner or disclose Cardholder Data to anyone other than the Card Brands or in response to a government request.

PCI DSS REQUIREMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, PLEASE VISIT THE PCI SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL WEBSITE (AVAILABLE AT WWW.PCISECURITYSTANDARDS.ORG) FREQUENTLY TO BE SURE YOU REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS.

You also agree that you will use only PCI DSS compliant Merchant Suppliers in connection with the storage or transmission of Cardholder Data. You will cause all Merchant Suppliers to complete any steps or certifications required by any Association (e.g., registrations, PA-DSS, PCI DSS, audits, etc.). You will cause your Merchant Suppliers to cooperate with Processor in completing any such steps or certifications (if applicable), and in performing any necessary due diligence on such Merchant Supplier. You shall be solely responsible for any and all applicable fees, costs, expenses and liabilities associated with such steps, registrations, and certifications.

You shall certify in writing your compliance with PCI DSS promptly upon our request or in accordance with the Card Brand Rules. We have the right to conduct PCI DSS audits, from time to time and at your sole expense, performed by us or a third party designated by us to verify your compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

In the event you learn or reasonably suspect that Cardholder Data was accessed or retrieved by any unauthorized person or entity, contact us immediately and in no event more than 24 hours after becoming aware of such activity. In the event of the foregoing, you must, at your own expense, (i) perform or cause to be performed an independent investigation (including a forensics analysis) of any data security breach of Cardholder Data or transaction data, (ii) perform or cause to be performed any remedial actions recommended by any such investigation, and (iii) cooperate with us in the investigation and resolution of any security breach.

We will maintain current domain registration as long as you are subscribed to the Website Hosting Services and have paid all applicable fees.

Upon written request during the Content Retention Period, we will provide your Content to you as follows: company logo file(s), image files, and text. Content exports shall not include our proprietary design templates or themes, or any customized elements. If your domain name was originally purchased by us, or you transferred your domain name ownership to us, we agree to work with you in good faith to transfer your domain name to you, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to do so. At the end of the Content Retention Period, if you have not worked with us to transfer your domain, we will relinquish control of your domain name and release it back to the TLD Registry. We will not pay any renewal or other domain name-related fees or costs after termination of the Website Services.
