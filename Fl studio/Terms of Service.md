The User acknowledges that ALPHA / BETA versions tend to crash, contain more bugs than a final release, might not be fully compatible with the final release and can share registry entries with an existing installation, causing it to malfunction. Therefore beta versions should only be used for testing purposes by experienced Users who know what they are doing.
    6. In no event does Image Line authorize the User to use the Products in applications or systems where the Product’s failure to perform can reasonably be expected to result in a significant physical injury, or in loss of life. Any such use is entirely at the User’s own risk, and the User agrees to hold Image Line harmless from any claims or losses relating to such unauthorized use.
    7. The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his account information and registration key and is fully responsible for activities that occur therewith. In case the User’s registration key is found to be available or accessible to any third party on any website, ftp site or otherwise, the User’s registration key will be blocked and rendered unusable without any reimbursement or indemnification by Image Line being due, not foreclosing the right of Image Line to claim any damages it may have suffered by the User’s breach of these Terms of Use.

    1. The User bears the burden of proof of defects in any of the Products or information and all your requests for warranty assistance shall be directed to Image Line.
    2. The User agrees to inspect the supplied Product upon delivery, and to verify that its quality corresponds to what was agreed. Any visible defects must be reported to Image Line in writing immediately within eight (8) days after delivery. After expiry of this period, the Product is deemed to be accepted, such that protest after this date is considered inadmissible. Acceptance covers all visible defects, i.e. all defects that the User at the time of the delivery or during the following eight (8) days could have determined via a careful and serious inspection. Complaints submitted to Image Line will be answered within a reasonable time from the date of receipt.
    3. The User will exercise due diligence and maintain strict safeguards on all Products received from Image Line to prevent unauthorized use or distribution thereof. If the User becomes aware of any unauthorized use or distribution of the Products, it shall immediately notify Image Line thereof via email.
    4. The User is responsible for testing the Products with non-critical data before relying on it. The User assumes the entire risk of using the Products.
    5. Should the User install an ALPHA / BETA version of the Software, it should install it in a different folder than the folder of the previous installation (if any). The User acknowledges that ALPHA / BETA versions tend to crash, contain more bugs than a final release, might not be fully compatible with the final release and can share registry entries with an existing installation, causing it to malfunction. Therefore beta versions should only be used for testing purposes by experienced Users who know what they are doing.
    6. In no event does Image Line authorize the User to use the Products in applications or systems where the Product’s failure to perform can reasonably be expected to result in a significant physical injury, or in loss of life. Any such use is entirely at the User’s own risk, and the User agrees to hold Image Line harmless from any claims or losses relating to such unauthorized use.
    7. The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his account information and registration key and is fully responsible for activities that occur therewith. In case the User’s registration key is found to be available or accessible to any third party on any website, ftp site or otherwise, the User’s registration key will be blocked and rendered unusable without any reimbursement or indemnification by Image Line being due, not foreclosing the right of Image Line to claim any damages it may have suffered by the User’s breach of these Terms of Use.
