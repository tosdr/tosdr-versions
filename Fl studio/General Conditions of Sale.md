Refund Policy
=============

![refund policy icon](https://www.image-line.com/innovaeditor/assets/legal/Affiliate-legal.png)

### Refund policy

**Software:** Image Line provides fully-functional, downloadable, try-before-you-buy versions of the Software. These allow you to evaluate\* the Software for as long as you want, before committing to any purchase(s). Please use this trial period to ensure the Software meets your needs, before purchasing a license. Our Software is fully-functional, and does not require registration to enable its primary functionality.  If you place an order for our Software, you will be able to download a registration code to activate your Software after payment has cleared. Once you have activated the Software, you are no longer eligible for any refund.  
We have this policy since it is impossible to fully return a registered version of our Software.

_\*Evaluation does not include the use of any trial version in a commercial production environment._  
Downloading the registration file implies the loss of the right of withdrawal - Article 16m of the directive on Consumer Rights 2011/83/EC.

**FL Cloud_:_** Image Line provides the possibility to try FL Cloud for free for a period of one month. These allow you to evaluate FL Cloud, before committing to any purchase(s). Please use this trial period to ensure FL Clouds meets your needs, before purchasing a license.  Once you purchase a subscription or service credits, no refund is possible. With regard to the FL Cloud subscription, it is however possible to cancel the subscription in case of a monthly subscription before the end of each month and in case of a yearly subscription before the end of each year.
