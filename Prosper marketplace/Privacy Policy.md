INFORMATION PROSPER COLLECTS ABOUT YOU
--------------------------------------

**Information Provided by You**

We collect personal information about you that you provide while you use Prosper websites, including but not limited to, [www.prosper.com](https://www.prosper.com/), [www.prospercards.com](https://www.prospercards.com/), [www.myprospercard.com](https://www.myprospercard.com/), or [www.prosperhealthcare.com](https://www.prosperhealthcare.com/) or any associated websites, desktop or mobile applications (collectively, the “Prosper website” or “Prosper websites”). We collect this information when you apply for credit or register as a borrower or investor. Additional information may be gathered during your subsequent use of the Prosper websites, or when we communicate with you via telephone, email or other means.

Certain personal information must be supplied when you apply for credit and/or register as a borrower or investor, or in connection with servicing your account, in order to meet our legal obligations, verify your identity, facilitate determinations for credit eligibility, protect against fraud, and complete your transaction. The following categories of information may be collected:

* Your basic identifying information (for example, your name, address, email, telephone number, and date of birth);
* Your Social Security number;
* Your employment and income information;
* Your bank account information;
* For a loan to be used with a merchant or service provider (e.g., a healthcare provider), the identity of the merchant or service provider and the name of the party that will receive the good or service;
* Other information you may provide in connection with a financial product or service, such as your demographic information (where permitted or required by applicable law) and the location and value of the property securing your loan;
* Government-issued identification or additional information for identity verification;
* Any personal information you provide us.

We may also collect information that you provide to us about your co-applicant in connection with a joint application or loan. By submitting information about someone other than yourself, you represent that you are authorized to provide us with that person’s information for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy and/or in connection with our services.

In addition, we gather names, email addresses, and phone numbers of people who contact us with questions.  We collect this information only for the purpose of responding to inquiries.  If you use our “refer-a-friend” feature, we will collect information from you in order to process your referral request.

You may also provide your information to certain third-party financing platforms who will process your application for credit and may provide your information to us. The use of your information by that online financing platform is governed by that company’s privacy policy.

If you use the comments section of our blog on [www.prosper.com](http://www.prosper.com/), you should be aware that information you submit is stored there and will be visible to other users of the Prosper websites.

Prosper collects consent to send text messages to customers. If you provide your consent for Prosper to send you text messages, Prosper will not pass this consent to other parties. Prosper does not purchase consent to send text messages to customers.

**Information Collected From Third Parties**

When you check your rate or apply for credit through Prosper, we will collect information from credit bureaus and other third parties to facilitate determinations for credit eligibility, perform analyses, provide you with marketing offers and assess risks related to extending credit to you and any co-applicant and, if you are a personal loan applicant, to help investors determine whether to commit to your personal loan. If you obtain a personal loan or credit card through Prosper, we also collect information throughout the life of your financial obligation through Prosper from credit bureaus and other third parties in order to assess risks associated with your financial obligation, perform analyses, provide information to investors interested in buying or selling your financial obligation, and to provide you with marketing offers. If another company refers you to Prosper or assists you in any way in the application process, we may also collect your information from that company in order to process your application.

The following categories of information are generally collected for personal loan, home equity, and credit card applicants, and customers:

* Your identifying and application information (for example, your name, address, email, telephone number, date of birth, social security number, and employment information);
* Your credit score, credit history and other information related to your creditworthiness, identity and financial transactions;
* Your bank account information and transactions;
* If you applied for a loan to be used with a merchant or service provider, information related to any dispute you submit regarding the merchant or service provider;
* If you applied for a loan or credit card that is processed through an online finance platform other than Prosper, the status and terms of your loan or loan offer through that platform;
* If you applied for a home equity product through Prosper, information related to your demographics (as required by law) and property, and any other information to evaluate and complete your application.

If you register as an investor through Prosper, we will collect information from credit bureaus and other third parties to verify your identity and bank account information and assess risks related to your account.  If another company refers you to Prosper or assists you in any way in the registration or investing process, we may also collect your information from that company in order to process your registration or request, or to update your account information.

**Information Gathered Based on Your Activity on the Prosper Websites**

In order to provide services to you, improve our business and maintain records required by law, Prosper collects information about your transactions and activity.  For personal loan borrowers, this includes your payment history.  For credit card customers, this includes your transaction data such as credit card purchases, payment or transaction history. For investors, this includes your fund transfers and purchases.  For all users, Prosper and/or its service providers collect information about your visits to [www.prosper.com](http://www.prosper.com/), [www.prospercards.com](https://prospercards.com/), [www.myprospercard.com](https://www.myprospercard.com/), or [www.prosperhealthcare.com](http://www.prosperhealthcare.com/) and other Prosper websites and the computer or device through which you access our websites, such as your IP address, geographical location, operating system, browser type, referral source, time and length of visit, button clicks and/or page views, and your mobile device identifier (IDFA or AAID). With respect to individuals that have not created user accounts with Prosper, we do not associate the information that we collect with an identifiable consumer or household.

For customers using our mobile apps, the mobile apps may periodically collect, transmit, and use geolocation information to enable certain features, including features that prevent fraudulent card use and send alerts, but only if you expressly authorize collection of such information. Geolocation information can be monitored on a continuous basis in the background only while the mobile app is being used or not at all, depending on your selection. You can change your location permissions at any time in your mobile device settings.

HOW PROSPER SHARES YOUR INFORMATION
-----------------------------------

We will share your personal information with nonaffiliates (companies not related by common ownership or control) and among affiliates (companies related by common ownership or control, including but not limited to the companies covered by this policy) only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.  By law, you are permitted to limit some types of sharing, but not others.

Prosper shares your information with third parties as permitted by law, including in the following specific ways:

* Lending Partners. All types of credit offered through Prosper are fulfilled by a third-party bank or non-bank lending partner that may extend credit to you (“Lending Partner”).  If you apply for a personal loan, home equity product, or credit card through Prosper, you are also providing your information to the potential Lending Partner, and further information may be provided to that Lending Partner after your loan originates or your card is issued.  The use of your information by your Lending Partner is governed by that Lending Partner’s privacy policy.

* Co-Applicants / Co-Borrowers. We may share certain limited information with your co-applicant / co-borrower in order to process your application and/or loan or service your account, and as needed to provide our services. 

* Third Party Service Providers. Prosper relies on third party service providers to help us conduct our business and marketing activities, such as maintaining our files and records, offering customer service, expanding access to our products, risk analysis, sending marketing communications, facilitating fund transfers, collecting past due debt, or negotiating settlements for delinquent debt.  Prosper may share your information with such companies, which are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to Prosper.  Information may also be shared among affiliates (including but not limited to the companies covered by this policy) for this purpose where one affiliated company provides services to or on behalf of another affiliated company in connection with your account or application.

* Prosper Card account holders: We share your information with Fiserv Solutions, LLC (“Fiserv”) for processing, servicing, and other account services. If you create an online account at [prospercards.com](http://www.prospercards.com/) and/or [www.myprospercard.com](http://www.myprospercard.com/), Fiserv will directly collect information provided by you via these sites, and may use that information according to the terms of Fiserv’s privacy policy, including for Fiserv’s own business purposes. By agreeing to Prosper’s Privacy Policy, you also agree to be bound by Fiserv’s privacy policy and consent to the use of your information provided via the aforementioned sites for Fiserv’s own business purposes. Fiserv’s privacy policy may be found here: [https://www.fiserv.com/en/about-fiserv/privacy-notice.html](https://www.fiserv.com/en/about-fiserv/privacy-notice.html)

* Potential Purchasers of Personal Loans. Prosper shares your information, including your Prosper Borrower Rating, on an anonymous basis to allow potential purchasers to decide whether to commit to your personal loan.  This information is also contained anonymously in personal loan data files available through Prosper’s Developer Tools and Marketplace Performance pages.  Although your credit information is displayed, your identity is never shared with investors until your personal loan has been purchased. 

* Loan Purchasers. If your personal or credit card loan originated through our platform is sold, we may provide the purchaser of your loan and their agents with your personal and credit information and loan identifier(s). Personal information is released to (1) personal loan purchasers; (2) qualified financial institutions with adequate protections to safeguard your personal information (“Qualified Institutions”); (3) service providers of Qualified Institutions; (4) Qualified Institutions that participate in structured deals; (5) debt buyers; and (6) auditors of purchasers, their lenders, or regulators.  In some cases, these purchasers may also provide targeted marketing to you.  Information provided to investors in connection with sales of our fractional Borrower Payment Dependent Notes (“Notes”) will not include personal identifying information.  For more information on Notes, please see our [Prospectus](https://www.prosper.com/prospectus).

* Referral Partners. If you were referred to Prosper by another company (a “Referral Partner”) or person, Prosper will share your information as necessary to honor the terms of its agreement with that Referral Partner or person and to process your transaction.  In some cases, Prosper may share your information with a Referral Partner for that Referral Partner’s own business purposes, such as to analyze and improve its business and provide marketing. Your rights with respect to this sharing are discussed in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Privacy Notice at the end of this policy.

* Merchants or Service Providers. If you applied for a loan to be used with a merchant or service provider, Prosper may share your information with the merchant or service provider associated with your loan application. 

* Credit Bureaus. Prosper may share your personal information with credit bureaus to meet our credit reporting obligations.

* Affiliates. Prosper affiliates, including entities covered by this policy and other companies related by common ownership or control may share your information with each other, including information related to your creditworthiness, for purposes of general business analysis or to present targeted marketing to you or others.  Your rights with respect to this sharing are discussed in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Privacy Notice at the end of this policy.

* Your Consent. Prosper may share your personal information with third parties at your direction or whenever you consent.

* Legal Requests & Regulatory Requirements. Prosper may share your personal information to comply with, or to allow investors or potential investors to comply with, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or regulatory or governmental request. Prosper may also share your personal information for the purposes of limiting fraud, or in connection with an audit or the sale of Prosper to a third party.
* Sharing of Anonymized Data.  Prosper may share aggregated and anonymized data sets with third parties, including, but not limited to, business partners, service providers, loan purchasers, potential loan purchasers, and among Prosper affiliates.  No personally identifiable information will be included in these data sets.

ADDITIONAL FACTS ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
------------------------------------------------

**How you can change your personal information**

If you have applied for a personal loan or registered as an investor, you can access the personal information you have provided to us by logging in at [www.prosper.com](https://www.prosper.com/), and navigating to the “Settings” page of your account.  As a registered investor, you can update your password, email, phone number, or home address at any time.  As a registered personal loan applicant or borrower, you may update your password, email, phone number, bank account information or mailing address at any time, though certain changes prior to loan origination may require you to submit a new loan application.  To change your information, you may also contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.prosper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  We will respond to your request within a reasonable time.

Credit card applicants: You can change your contact information by calling our customer service at 1-800-851-0630.

Prosper Card account holders: You can change your contact information by calling our customer service at 1-800-903-4697.

Home equity applicants: You can access the contact information you have provided to us by logging in at [www.prosper.com](https://www.prosper.com/), and navigating to the “Settings” page of your account.  To change application or other information, you may contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.prosper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

For all customers, we will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, conduct analyses or audits, or to enforce our agreements or as otherwise permitted and/or required by law.

**How Prosper Secures Your Information**

Prosper uses significant safeguards, including physical, technical (electronic), and operational controls to protect your personal information, both during transmission and once received.  If you have any questions about the security of your information, you can contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.prosper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Prosper equips all servers with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate to ensure that when you connect to our websites, you can tell that you are on a Prosper website and that all data entered into the websites are transmitted to us in a secure encrypted channel. Once on our system, personal information can only be read or written through defined service access points, the use of which is password-protected.  Data security is achieved through technical safeguards that include a combination of encryption, firewalls, intrusion prevention system, malware detection system, and data loss prevention systems.  Prosper also conducts vulnerability scans of applications and systems regularly. 

Access to the system is tightly controlled and limited to only those who have a need to access information.  Administrative safeguards such as a security awareness program, background checks, and internal information use policy ensure that only trained and trusted staff are permitted to access personal information.  Some additional features of our security program include:

**S_ecure Data Center_**

We store all sensitive financial information in state-of-the-art, highly secure data centers that are audited per AICPA SOC for Service Organizations. Physical access to the data centers is strictly controlled and we use the latest threat prevention technologies such as network and web application firewalls, VPN, antivirus, Web filtering and antispam technologies.

**_Session Time-Outs_**

We employ session time-outs to protect your account or application. You will be logged out of the site automatically after a specified period of inactivity. This time-out feature reduces the risk of others being able to access your account or information if you leave your computer unattended.

**_Account Authentication_**

If you have an account, at a minimum, we require that you use a password or follow other secure steps we have instituted to allow you to access your account. If you create a password, you must use both numbers and letters in your password. We have also instituted secure steps by which you can regain access to your account should you forget your password. You should always choose a password that is difficult for others to guess and change your password frequently. 

**Additional Steps You Should Take to Ensure the Security of Your Information**

Prosper sends important communications regarding your account or application via email.  You should therefore take steps to secure and restrict access to your email account and change your email account password frequently.  You should also be aware of fraudulent emails known as “phishing,” from companies claiming to be Prosper and requesting your login information or other account information.  Prosper will never ask for your login information in an email.  

When you are finished using Prosper websites, you should log out completely, then close the browser window and clear the browser’s cache files and saved passwords.  This step is particularly important if you use a computer that is accessed by other people, such as in a public library or Internet café.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Any updates to the Privacy Policy become effective when posted on Prosper websites.  If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by providing the revised Privacy Policy in your account on [www.prosper.com](https://www.prosper.com/) if you have one. Your continued use of our services following the update means that you accept Prosper’s updated Privacy Policy.

For additional information, or if you have any questions regarding this policy or the privacy practices at Prosper, please submit your questions or comments directly to [\[email protected\]](https://www.prosper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
