Prosper Data Terms of Use
=========================

**As a condition to using Prosper’s data, you must comply with the following Data Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, Prosper does not grant you a license to use the data.**

The following are terms of a legal agreement (the “Agreement”) between you, individually and/or as an agent on behalf of an entity or another registered member (“you”), and Prosper Funding LLC (“Prosper”, “we”, or “us”) that sets forth the terms and conditions for your use of Prosper’s data (the “Data Terms of Use”). The data, including all text, articles, models, input, output, design, source code, software, photos, images and other content or information made available, in any form or manner whatsoever, by Prosper is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Data.” The Data is owned by Prosper. By accessing, receiving, or obtaining the Data in any form or manner whatsoever, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement between you and Prosper and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You also agree to comply with Prosper’s Data Terms of Use, as they may be amended from time to time.

Prosper reserves the right to amend the Data Terms of Use at any time and posting the revised Data Terms of Use on the Prosper website (the “Site”) shall be the minimal notice to you of such changes. You should check the Data Terms of Use periodically for changes. Unless otherwise indicated, all changes shall be effective upon posting and will supersede all previous versions. Your continued use of, receipt of, obtaining of, or access to the Data after any change to the Data Terms of Use constitutes your agreement to be bound by all provisions of the most current Data Terms of Use as posted on the Site. If you disagree with the Data Terms of Use or any changes to the Data Terms of Use, your only option is to discontinue your use of, receipt of, obtaining of, or access to the Data. Prosper may, in its sole discretion, with or without cause, terminate this Agreement at any time without prior notice or liability to you or anyone else.

LICENSE TO USE DATA
-------------------

Prosper grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicenseable license to the use of, receipt of, obtaining of, or access to the Data for any lawful use that does not compete with products and services offered by Prosper, its parent company, Prosper Marketplace, Inc., any affiliates or any subsidiaries, on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The license shall continue for as long as Prosper makes the Data useable by or accessible to you; provided, however, that the license shall terminate immediately if you violate any terms of this Agreement. Prosper may, in its sole discretion, with or without cause, modify, enhance, suspend, terminate or discontinue this license, or restrict your access to all or a portion of the data at any time without prior notice or liability to you or anyone else. The data may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors, and Prosper does not undertake any obligation or responsibility to update or amend the data, or to provide support for the use of, receipt of, obtaining of, or access to the Data. All Data obtained from or provided by Prosper, regardless of the method of delivery, is explicitly prohibited from publication and distribution. Moreover, you represent that all Data provided by Prosper to a user, regardless of the method of delivery, is not used for any competing purposes and only used to permit investment using the products or services of Prosper.

In particular, any use or display any Data must be in full compliance with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act as well as all applicable state credit reporting statutes and regulations.
