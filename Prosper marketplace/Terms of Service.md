IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT.

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.

What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.

\*  For example, a three-year $10,000 personal loan would have an interest rate of 9.38% and a 9.99% origination fee for an annual percentage rate (APR) of 16.74% APR. You would receive $9,001.00 and make 36 scheduled monthly payments of $319.77. A five-year $10,000 personal loan would have an interest rate of 11.14% and a 9.99% origination fee with a 15.84% APR. You would receive $9,001.00 and make 60 scheduled monthly payments of $218.12. Origination fees vary between 1% and 9.99%. Personal loan APRs through Prosper range from 8.99% to 35.99%, with the lowest rates for the most creditworthy borrowers. Eligibility for personal loans up to $50,000 depends on the information provided by the applicant in the application form. Eligibility for personal loans is not guaranteed, and requires that a sufficient number of investors commit funds to your account and that you meet credit and other conditions. Refer to Borrower Registration Agreement for details and all terms and conditions. All personal loans made by WebBank.
