Investor Credit Report Authorization
====================================

I understand that I am providing “written instructions” to Prosper Funding LLC (“Prosper”) under the Fair Credit Reporting Act authorizing Prosper, Prosper’s parent company, Prosper Marketplace, Inc., or their respective agents (collectively, the “Prosper Parties”), to obtain information from my personal credit profile from one or more consumer reporting agencies. I authorize the Prosper Parties to obtain such information to confirm my eligibility to invest, including but not limited to my residence and identity.

Notes offered by Prospectus. Notes investors receive are dependent for payment on unsecured loans made to individual borrowers. Not FDIC-insured; investments may lose value; no Prosper or bank guarantee. Prosper does not verify all information provided by borrowers in listings. Investors should review the prospectus before investing.
