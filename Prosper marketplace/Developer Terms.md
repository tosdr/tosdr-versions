Prosper API Terms of Use
========================

**As a condition to using Prosper’s application programming interface or other data supplied by Prosper (“API”), you must comply with the following API Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms without limitations or exclusions, Prosper does not grant you a license to use the API.**

The following are terms of a legal agreement (the “Agreement”) between you, individually and/or as an agent on behalf of an entity or another registered user (“you”), and Prosper Funding LLC (“Prosper”, “we”, or “us”) that sets forth the terms and conditions for your use of Prosper’s API (the “API Terms of Use”). The API is owned and operated by Prosper. The API, together with all tools, data, text, articles, design, source code, software, photos, images and other content or information (including without limitation all information included on the Data Export page located at [DataExport](https://www.prosper.com/plp/tools/dataexport "Data Export")) made available through the API is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “API Service.” By accessing, browsing or using the API Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement between you and Prosper and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You also agree to comply with Prosper’s API Terms of Use, as they may be amended from time to time.

We reserve the right to amend the API Terms of Use at any time and posting the revised API Terms of Use on the Prosper website (the “Site”) shall be notice to you of such changes. You should check the API Terms of Use periodically for changes. Unless otherwise indicated, all changes shall be effective upon posting and will supersede all previous versions. Your continued use of the API Service after any change to the API Terms of Use constitutes your agreement to be bound by all provisions of the most current API Terms of Use as posted on the Site. If you disagree with the API Terms of Use or any changes to the API Terms of Use, your only option is to discontinue your use of the API Service. We may, in our sole discretion, with or without cause, terminate this Agreement at any time without prior notice or liability to you or anyone else.

LICENSE TO USE API SERVICE
--------------------------

Prosper grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicenseable license to use the API Service for any lawful use that does not compete with products and services offered by Prosper, its parent company, Prosper Marketplace, Inc., any affiliates or any subsidiaries, on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The license shall continue for as long as we make the API Service available to you; provided, however, that the license will terminate immediately if you violate any terms of this Agreement. We may, in our sole discretion, with or without cause, modify, enhance, suspend, terminate or discontinue this license, or restrict your access to all or any part of the API Service at any time without prior notice or liability to you or anyone else. The API Service may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors, and Prosper does not undertake any obligation or responsibility to update or amend the API Service, or to provide support for your use of the API Service.

  
All data obtained from or provided by Prosper, regardless of the method of delivery, is explicitly prohibited from publication and distribution. Moreover, you represent that all data provided by Prosper to a user, regardless of the method of delivery, is not used for any competing purposes and only used to permit investment using the products or services of Prosper.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAW
-------------------

You agree to use the API Service only for lawful purposes. You are prohibited from any use of the API Service that would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or local laws, including but not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and other fair lending laws, Truth in Lending Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, federal or state consumer privacy laws, state licensing laws, or state unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes, or in any manner that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability. In particular, any use or display any data, text, articles, design, source code, software, photos, images and other content or information made available through the API must be in full compliance with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act as well as all applicable state credit reporting statutes and regulations. If you access the API Service from outside of the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the laws of your specific jurisdiction. Children under the age of 18 are not eligible to use the API Service.

GENERAL RESTRICTIONS
--------------------

You agree not to (i) modify, decompile or otherwise alter the API Service, (ii) use the API Service to reveal or display any non-public personally identifiable information of any user of the Site, (iii) use the API Service to defame, libel, threaten or harass any user of the Site or the API Service, (iv) use the API Service to bid on listings on behalf of other lenders without Prosper’s prior written consent, (v) query the API Service more than 20 times per second (the “Query Limitation”) or otherwise knowingly attempt to circumvent the Query Limitation, or (vi) use the data provided by Prosper, in any manner whatsoever (including, but not limited to via an API Service or data from the Site), for any competing uses or purposes. You further agree that you have never used data from Prosper, in any manner whatsoever (including, but not limited to via an API Service or data from the Site), in the past to compete with the products or services of Prosper.

Any feedback, remarks, discussions, ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, graphics or other submissions you make through the Site, including through any forums or other communications relating to the API Service (collectively, “Submissions”), shall be deemed and remain the property of Prosper, and Prosper is entitled to use any Submission for any purpose, without restriction or compensation to the individual who has provided the Submission. Prosper shall not be subject to any obligations of confidentiality regarding Submissions except as expressly agreed by Prosper or as otherwise required by applicable law.

Any questions concerning any Prosper marks, should be referred to Prosper.
