Tracking Technologies
---------------------

We use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g., language preference) and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

### Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting

Please note, you may opt-out of all activity-based ads, from us and others, by [clicking here](https://preferences.truste.com/here) (or if located in the European Union [click here](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

### Behavioral Tracking / Analysis

We use third party behavior tracking and analytics services to better understand our Subscribers’ needs and to optimize our product and user experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.). This information enables us to build and maintain our product with user feedback. These services use cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices.

How Can Your Information be Secured?
------------------------------------

We provide the capability for your data to be encrypted. However, the creator of the form in which you input data chooses how and whether to encrypt your information. Before inputting any sensitive information, determine if encryption is enabled by looking for the “lock” symbol on your web browser or a yellow highlight in the web browser address bar.

INFORMATION OR E-MAIL THAT YOU SEND TO US MAY NOT BE SECURE UNLESS WE ADVISE YOU THAT SECURITY MEASURES WILL BE IN PLACE PRIOR TO YOUR TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as a social security number to us through an unsecured e-mail.

Information Security
--------------------

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.formassembly.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We do not, however, secure your personal information that is in the possession or control of our Subscriber.
