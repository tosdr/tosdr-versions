Our blog is also managed by a third party application that may require you to register to post a comment. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog.

Tracking Technologies
---------------------

We use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g., language preference) and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

### Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting

We partner with a third party to manage our advertising of our service on other sites. We use retargeting to advertise our product. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

Please note, you may opt-out of all activity-based ads, from us and others, by [clicking here](https://preferences.truste.com/here) (or if located in the European Union [click here](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

### Behavioral Tracking / Analysis

We use third party behavior tracking and analytics services to better understand our Subscribers’ needs and to optimize our product and user experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.). This information enables us to build and maintain our product with user feedback. These services use cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This usage data is stored on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile in an aggregated or de-identified form for statistical purposes. These services are contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.

How Can Your Information be Secured?
------------------------------------

We provide the capability for your data to be encrypted. However, the creator of the form in which you input data chooses how and whether to encrypt your information. Before inputting any sensitive information, determine if encryption is enabled by looking for the “lock” symbol on your web browser or a yellow highlight in the web browser address bar.

INFORMATION OR E-MAIL THAT YOU SEND TO US MAY NOT BE SECURE UNLESS WE ADVISE YOU THAT SECURITY MEASURES WILL BE IN PLACE PRIOR TO YOUR TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as a social security number to us through an unsecured e-mail.

Information Security
--------------------

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.formassembly.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We do not, however, secure your personal information that is in the possession or control of our Subscriber.

How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?
------------------------------------------------

FormAssembly Inc. has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, who seeks to correct, amend, delete inaccurate data or withdraw consent to further contact should direct his/her query to FormAssembly Inc.‘s Client (the data controller). If the Client requests FormAssembly Inc. to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.

Upon request FormAssembly Inc. will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may request access to all your personally identifiable information to correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the change by logging into your account, by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.formassembly.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. FormAssembly Inc. will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?
-------------------------------------------------------

In certain situations, FormAssembly Inc. may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may disclose your personal information:

What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?
