### Collection and Use of Information

**Personally identifiable information.** We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to and collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent any personally identifiable information to anyone.

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about new products or services, surveys or contests, or changes to this privacy policy.

**Non-personally identifiable information.** We collect non-personally identifiable information which is data that has not been directly associated to any specific individual. This includes keeping track of user activity as well as collecting the images that are created on our site. We may log information regarding user execution environments (eg. browser type, operating system, remote address). We also aggregate demographic information about users such as age, gender, location.

We use non-personally identifiable information to better understand our users so that we can improve our products, services and marketing strategies.

### Sharing of Information

We share aggregated demographic information with our advertisers to enable them to better target ad content to our users.

From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive such information, we will with your permission share your name, email address and other information that you opt to provide to them.

We will not share your personally identifiable information with any third party outside of our organization other than as necessary to fulfill your request, to comply with the law or to satisfy any requirements in the event of a company reorganization that may involve the merger, acquisition or sale of our assets.

If you Share your creation, and allow "Public background", then this will allow others to use your image. You are agreeing to make it public. (If you don't agree, then de-select "Public background"). If you use our "Share" link, it will create a public facing page that anyone can view (if they know the URL). We don't currently link to the creations (Jan 2014), but in the future we may add a feature for people to view popular and recently created images.
