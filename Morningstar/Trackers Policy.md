**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**
-------------------------------------------

###### Last updated: June 30, 2023

This Cookie Policy explains how Morningstar and its affiliates (collectively, “we”) use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies (collectively, “cookies”) when you visit our sites. This policy should be read together with our [Privacy Statements](https://www.morningstar.com/company/privacy-center), our and your contract with us.

### **What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small file that can be stored on your device when you access our site and is then sent back to us each time you visit our site. Cookies are useful because they allow us to recognize your device and your preferences.

### **How do we use cookies?**

We use cookies to know whether you’re logged in to our site, recognize the products and services you subscribe to, remember your preferred site language, location, and other preferences, and show you advertisements relevant to your interests. We use session cookies (which last until you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which last until you or your browser deletes them). These cookies fall into two broad categories: “essential cookies,” which originate from us and are necessary for us to provide you with our services, and “non-essential cookies,” which typically originate from third parties and are not required for you to use our services.

### **Essential cookies**

We use essential cookies for the following purposes:

* **Authentication**—We use cookies to allow you to sign into our services and stay signed in throughout one or multiple site visits.
* **Subscription**—We use cookies to recognize that you’ve bought our Premium service and make sure you’re able to view the content and tools that you’ve paid for.
* **Site language**—We have many sites across the world, and we use a cookie to make sure you see our site in a language commonly used in your country.

### **Non-essential cookies**

We use non-essential cookies for the following purposes:

* **Analytics**—Our third-party partners use cookies to provide us with analytics services. These partners, including Google Analytics, use cookies to help us understand how our customers use our sites.
* **Advertising**—Our third-party partners also use cookies to provide advertising services. These partners use cookies to show you ads that may interest you.

### **California Rights**

California residents have the right to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of their personal information, as both terms are defined by California law. For more information on how Morningstar "sells" or "shares" personal information under California law, please visit our [Americas Privacy Statement.](https://www.morningstar.com/company/privacy-policy/americas)

Morningstar websites use third party cookies used for targeted advertising, which is considered the "sharing" of personal information under California Law. If you would like to manage targeted advertising cookies, please [click here](https://www.morningstar.com/company/privacy-policy/americas#opt-out).

### **How we revise this statement**

Our business frequently changes, and we may need to update this policy to reflect those changes. When we make changes to this policy, we’ll revise the “last updated” date at the top of this page.

If you would like to learn more about the personal information we collect and use, please visit our [Privacy Statements](https://www.morningstar.com/company/privacy-center), contact us at [privacy@morningstar.com](mailto:privacy@morningstar.com), or write us at the following address:
