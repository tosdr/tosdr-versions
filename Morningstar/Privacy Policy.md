### **Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms**

We and other third parties use cookies, pixel tags, and other similar tracking mechanisms to automatically collect information about browsing activity, type of device, and similar information within our Services.

**What is a cookie?** A cookie is a small file that can be stored on your device when you access our site and is then sent back to us each time you visit our site. Cookies are useful because they allow us to recognize your device and your preferences.

**How do we use cookies?** We use cookies to know whether you’re logged in to our site, recognize the products and Services you subscribe to, remember your preferred site language, location, and other preferences, and show you advertisements relevant to your interests. We use session cookies (which last until you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which last until you or your browser deletes them). These cookies fall into two broad categories: “essential cookies,” which originate from us and are necessary for us to provide you with our Services, and “non-essential cookies,” which typically originate from third parties and are not required for you to use our Services.

**Essential cookies.** We may use essential cookies for purposes such as:

* **Authentication** \- We use cookies to allow you to stay signed into our Services and stay signed in throughout one or multiple site visits.
* **Subscription** \- We use cookies to recognize that you’ve purchased certain Services and make sure you’re able to view the content and tools that you’ve paid for.

**Non-essential cookies.** We may use non-essential cookies, including some provided by third parties, for purposes such as:

* **Analytics** - to provide us with analytics services. These cookies help us understand how our customers use our sites and services.
* **Advertising** - to provide advertising services. These cookies help show you ads that may interest you.

**Third Party Analytics.** We use third party tools, such as Google Analytics, which are operated by third party companies, to evaluate usage of our sites and Services. These third party analytics companies use cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies to collect usage data about our Services and to provide us with reports and metrics that help us evaluate usage of our Services, improve our sites, and enhance performance and user experiences. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Cross-Device Use.** We and our third party providers may use the information that we collect about you within our Services and on other third party sites and services to help us and our third party service providers identify other devices that you use (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer, etc.).

**Customer Lists and Matching.** Unless you have opted out, we may share certain hashed customer list information (such as your name, email address and other contact information) with third parties so that we can better target ads and content to our users, and others with similar interests, within third party sites, platforms, and services. You may opt out of being targeted by us in this manner.

**Managing Cookie Settings.** To prevent cookies from tracking your activity on our sites or visits across multiple websites, you can set your browser to block certain cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. You can also delete cookies. The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your device from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to delete cookies. Visitors to our sites who disable cookies will be able to browse the sites, but some features may not function.

**Industry Solutions for Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising.** Visitors to our sites may follow the steps provided by industry associations and that provide tools and educate users on interest-based advertising. These resources include:

Your opt-out may not be effective if your browser is configured to reject cookies, and your choice must be made on every device and browser you use. If you clear cookies, you will need to reconfirm your choice.
