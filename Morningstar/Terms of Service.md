Use of Morningstar Community
----------------------------

To the extent the Service involves any access to any forum, blog, private message, email or other medium (e.g., a comments section within a video or associated with an article) by which discussions may be effected (individually and collectively, the “Morningstar Community”), you understand and agree that Morningstar makes no representations or warranties with respect to any such portion of the Morningstar Community or with respect to any messages, information, or materials contained in it. You acknowledge and agree that your use of, or reliance upon, any such messages, information, or materials is at your sole risk and expense.

Morningstar does not, and cannot, review all of the information and materials provided in the Morningstar Community and has no responsibility or liability for any such information or materials or their use. If Morningstar becomes aware of any information or materials that it determines violate the terms of this Agreement or the Morningstar Community policies promulgated by Morningstar from time to time or that Morningstar otherwise deems inappropriate in its sole discretion, Morningstar reserves the right to delete, move, or edit any such information or materials.

To the extent that you use the Morningstar Community, you covenant that you will: (a) comply with the Morningstar Community policies promulgated by Morningstar from time to time; (b) be solely responsible for your use of the Morningstar Community and any messages, information, and materials provided by you or through another user making use of your password; (c) not advertise or offer to sell goods or services of any kind in the Morningstar Community; and (d) not upload, post, publish, or transmit any messages, information, or materials that (i) restrict or inhibit any other user from accessing, using or enjoying the Service, (ii) are unlawful, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, offensive, pornographic, profane, sexually explicit, or indecent, (iii) constitute or encourage conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable law, (iv) violate or infringe the rights of Morningstar or any third party (including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and rights of privacy and publicity), (v) constitute or contain false or misleading indications of origin or statements of fact, (vi) contain software or any other commercial materials or information, or (vii) contain any viruses or other harmful component.

Governing Law and Jurisdiction
------------------------------

This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, U.S.A., without giving effect to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law provision or rule (whether of the State of Illinois or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than that of the State of Illinois. You hereby consent to, and agree to bring any and all claims in, the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Cook County, Illinois, U.S.A., for any action or proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Service, or the use of, or reliance on this Service, whether based in contract or tort or otherwise. Each party expressly waives the right to trial by jury.

Waiver of Class Action
----------------------

Except as otherwise specifically prohibited by applicable law, all disputes arising from or related to this Agreement, a party’s performance hereunder or any of its acts or omissions (or any of the acts or omissions of any of its agents) will be adjudicated on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action or as a member of a class, mass, consolidated or representative action, irrespective of the forum in which they are heard. Any claim asserted by a party hereunder shall not be joined for any purpose with the claim or claims of any other person or entity, unless both parties specifically agree to the joinder of individual actions.

Entire Agreement
----------------

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Morningstar regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior negotiations, representations, warranties, undertakings, or agreements, written or oral, between the parties regarding such subject matter.

Severability
------------

To the maximum extent possible, each provision in this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be valid and enforceable under applicable law. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be modified so as to be rendered valid and enforceable while implementing, to the maximum extent possible, the original intent of such provision. If such modification is not possible or allowed, then such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such unenforceability or invalidity without affecting the remainder of such provision or any other provisions in this Agreement.

Premium User Provisions
-----------------------

In addition to the above, the following provisions apply to you if you subscribe to the Premium portion of the Service (“Premium Service”):

Subscribing to the Premium Service
----------------------------------

You may not use the Premium Service without a valid subscription from Morningstar — at which point you will be deemed a “Premium Member”. To obtain a subscription, you must register for the Premium Service either by completing and submitting the online registration form available for the Premium Service or by calling the toll-free number listed below under “Customer Service and Product Support” and providing Morningstar with all of the required enrollment information. Your subscription will not be valid unless and until Morningstar accepts your completed registration. By registering for the Premium Service, you represent and warrant that all registration information that you provide is true, complete, and accurate, and you agree to notify Morningstar promptly of any changes to this registration information. This notification can be effected either by editing your user profile in the Service or by calling the toll-free number listed below under “Customer Service and Product Support.”

AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OF PREMIUM SERVICE
------------------------------------

**You may be offered a free trial subscription to the Premium Service and this free trial subscription will normally begin on the date on which Morningstar accepts your completed registration. Unless cancelled by you or Morningstar during this trial period, the initial term of your regular paid Premium Service subscription will start immediately after the free trial period ends, and will continue for the length of time that you selected when you registered. If you have ever taken a free trial to the Premium Service, you will not be eligible to receive another free trial. Instead, the initial term of your Premium Service subscription will begin immediately upon Morningstar accepting your registration and your credit card will be charged for the subscription fee associated with the term length you selected when you registered.**

**In those instances where you subscribe to the Premium Service using a special or introductory offer, unless you notify us that you wish to cancel your Premium Service subscription before the end of its initial term, your Premium Service subscription will automatically renew for the period of time specified in that offer and your credit card will be charged the subscription fee in effect at the time for that subscription term length.**

**Other than as described elsewhere in this section, unless you notify us that you wish to cancel your Premium Service subscription before the end of its then-current subscription term, your Premium Service subscription will continue to automatically renew for successive terms of the same duration and your credit card will be charged for each such renewal at the subscription fee in effect at the time of that renewal.**

Changes to the Premium Service
------------------------------

MORNINGSTAR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE PREMIUM SERVICE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ADDING OR REMOVING FEATURES). IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY SUCH CHANGES, OR IF YOU ARE OTHERWISE DISSATISFIED WITH THE PREMIUM SERVICE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS PERFORMANCE OR AVAILABILITY), YOUR ONLY REMEDY IS TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, AS SET FORTH BELOW.

### Charges and Billing Practices

Premium Service subscription Fees on credit-card transactions are authorized immediately, but not actually processed until any applicable limited time free trial period has expired. Subscription fees will be based upon the subscription rates in effect at the start of each subscription term and apply whether or not you actually use the Premium Service during that term. You can always find the current retail subscription rates by reviewing the Member Benefits on the Service.

Morningstar reserves the right to change the fees it charges for products, services or features (collectively, “Products”) offered in connection with the Premium Service and/or the Service at any time. These sorts of changes include, but are not limited to, adding fees for new/optional Products and/or modifying fees for existing Products. By using any of the Products, with which there are associated fees, you agree to pay those fees. If you do not want to pay these associated fees, you must cancel your subscription, as set forth below. For absence of doubt, if Morningstar increases the base Premium Service subscription fee at some point during your then-current subscription term, that increased fee will only apply to you upon the next renewal, if any, of your Premium Service subscription.

Subscription fees and all others fees and charges associated with your Premium Service subscription (including, but not limited to, any applicable federal, state, and local taxes) will be billed automatically to the credit card you provide when registering for the Premium Service (“your credit card”). If your credit card is a VISA or MasterCard and the number or expiration date for your credit card changes for any reason (for instance, you get a new number because your old card expired, was stolen, etc.), that updated information may be automatically passed on from your credit card issuer to Morningstar, and if we do receive such information, it will be treated by Morningstar as if it were originally furnished by you. To learn more about this pass-along service being provided by your credit card issuer, please contact it directly.

While you are a Premium Subscriber, you must promptly notify Morningstar — if any information you provided to us related to your credit card — for instance, your billing address — changes or is no longer valid for any reason. Absent such notification, Morningstar will assume that all of the information related to your credit card remains valid and will submit to the card processor all information that it requires for approval, both when you initially subscribe and, if applicable, upon the commencement of any renewal of that subscription. If any subscription fees or other charges billed to your credit card are declined for any reason, Morningstar shall have the right to suspend your subscription until such subscription fees or other charges are paid in full. You agree to pay all costs (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Morningstar in collecting any unpaid subscription fees or other charges from you. To notify Morningstar, please either reach out to us at the toll-free number set forth below in Customer Service and Product Support or email us at [cancellation@morningstar.com](mailto:cancellation@morningstar.com).

### Cancellation

If you purchased your Premium Service subscription through Morningstar, you may cancel it (i) by calling the telephone number listed under “Customer Service and Product Support” to notify Morningstar; or (ii) by going to the MyAccount portion of the Premium Service (located at [www.morningstar.com](https://www.morningstar.com/)) navigating to “Membership,” clicking on “Cancel” and then following the on-screen instructions to complete the cancellation process; or (iii) by sending an email to [cancellation@morningstar.com](mailto:cancellation@morningstar.com).

If you cancel your subscription during your free trial period, you will not be responsible for the payment of a subscription fee. However, except as otherwise provided herein, if you cancel your Premium Service subscription at any time after your trial period expires, your subscription to the Premium Service will continue in effect until the next monthly anniversary of the effective date of your paid subscription. (For example, if your paid Premium Service subscription start date is on January 1 and you cancel it on June 15, your Premium Service subscription remains in effect until July 1, at which time it ends.) For those with yearly or multi-year subscriptions, any remaining prepaid charges will be refunded, prorated on a monthly basis, to your credit card after your Premium Service subscription ends.

Morningstar may at any time immediately cancel your subscription, without notice or liability, if it determines in its sole discretion that: (i) you have breached any portion of this Agreement; or (ii) your use of or access to the Premium Service or any other portion of the Service violates any applicable law or regulation or otherwise inhibits any other subscriber from using or accessing any portion of the Service, including, without limitation, the Premium Service. Upon such cancellation, you will have no further right to access or use any portion of the Service. None of the foregoing limits any other legal, equitable, or contractual rights available to Morningstar.

Morningstar may, in its sole discretion, choose not to renew your subscription by sending a notice of non-renewal at any time during your subscription term to the e-mail address you provided when completing your registration. You will be deemed to have received this notice, whether or not you saw it or the e-mail address provided by you continues to be valid. In the event of such a notice, your subscription will cease and will not automatically renew at the end of your then-current subscription term.

If you purchased the Premium Service via the Apple In-App Purchase (IAP) mechanism, then, subject to applicable law, you may only cancel your Premium Service subscription through Apple. Please direct all questions regarding the status of your account to Apple and reference your Apple ID. Please refer to the app’s License Agreement in the Apple iTunes app store for more details.

Morningstar Mobile Apps
-----------------------

For subscriptions purchased through IAP, your membership INCLUDES access to Premium Service, and will continue to automatically renew until non-renewed or cancelled; see the **Automatic Renewal of Premium Service** section above and the **Cancellation** section below. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subject to applicable law, your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by you and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase.

Dow Jones
---------

If you are a “Securities Professional” as defined herein, then, in addition to any other restrictions contained herein, you may not use any of the information from Dow Jones Business News or Dow Jones and Company, Inc. to provide advice or products or services to a third party. You may use information from Dow Jones Business News or Dow Jones and Company, Inc. solely for your personal investing or educational purposes and not in connection with any commercial product or service or in connection with advising third parties, or buying, selling, or trading securities for or on behalf of third parties. A “Securities Professional” means a person who: (i) acts as a broker or dealer in the purchase or sale of negotiable financial instruments or is registered or qualified in any capacity under any federal or state securities or commodities trading law, rule, or regulation or the rules or regulations of any securities or commodities exchange, market, or association; (ii) falls within the definition of “investment banker” as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940; (iii) is a national securities or commodities exchange, registered securities or commodities association, or registered clearing agency; (iv) engages in the buying and selling of negotiable financial instruments for his or her employer or for an entity or its customers’ accounts; or (v) is engaged in the business of managing or directing a fund or portfolio of assets (that includes negotiable financial instruments) owned principally by third parties.

Transparency is our policy. Learn how it impacts everything we do Read More

Transparency is how we protect the integrity of our work and keep empowering investors to achieve their goals and dreams. And we have unwavering standards for how we keep that integrity intact, from our research and data to our policies on content and your personal data.

We’d like to share more about how we work and what drives our day-to-day business.

### How we make money

We sell different types of products and services to both investment professionals and individual investors. These products and services are usually sold through license agreements or subscriptions. Our investment management business generates asset-based fees, which are calculated as a percentage of assets under management. We also sell both admissions and sponsorship packages for our investment conferences and advertising on our websites and newsletters.

### How we use your personal data

How we use your information depends on the product and service that you use and your relationship with us. We may use it to:

* Verify your identity, personalize the content you receive, or create and administer your account.
* Provide specific products and services to you, such as portfolio management or data aggregation.

### How we approach editorial content

Maintaining independence and editorial freedom is essential to our mission of empowering investor success. We provide a platform for our authors to report on investments fairly, accurately, and from the investor’s point of view. We also respect individual opinions––they represent the unvarnished thinking of our people and exacting analysis of our research processes. Our authors can publish views that we may or may not agree with, but they show their work, distinguish facts from opinions, and make sure their analysis is clear and in no way misleading or deceptive.

To further protect the integrity of our editorial content, we keep a strict separation between our sales teams and authors to remove any pressure or influence on our analyses and research.

Read our [editorial policy](https://www.morningstar.com/editorial-policy) to learn more about our process.
