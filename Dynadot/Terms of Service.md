PART I:

SERVICE AGREEMENT

1.1     This Part I (Service Agreement) applies to any person or entity which creates a user account with Dynadot, otherwise has control over a user account with Dynadot, or uses any of the services described herein.

2    ACCURACY OF REGISTRATION DATA

2.1     You shall provide to Dynadot accurate and reliable contact details and correct and update them within seven (7) days of any change during the term of a domain name's registration, including:  
    a)     Your full name;  
    b)     Your postal address;  
    c)     Your e-mail address;  
    d)     Your voice telephone number;  
    e)     Your fax number, if available;  
    f)     if you are an organization, association or corporation, the name of an authorized person for contact purposes;  
    g)     the names of the primary nameserver and secondary nameserver(s) for the associated domain name;  
    h)     the name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and (if available) fax number of the technical contact for the associated domain name; and,  
    i)     the name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and (if available) fax number of the administrative contact for the associated domain name.

2.2     If You, directly or indirectly, willfully provide inaccurate or unreliable information to Dynadot, willfully fail to update information provided to Dynadot within seven (7) days of any change, or fail to respond for over fifteen (15) days to inquiries by Dynadot concerning the accuracy of contact details associated with Your domain name, then such action or inaction, as appropriate, shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and become a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the associated domain name registration.

3    THIRD PARTIES, LICENSING & RESALE

3.1     Prior to reselling a domain name to a third party:  
    a)     You shall notify that third party that the domain name is registered with Dynadot, a domain name registrar accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN");  
    b)     You shall notify that third party that You are neither a domain name registrar accredited by ICANN nor an authorized reseller of Dynadot's Services;  
    c)     That third party shall furnish You with a written acceptance of this Agreement; and,  
    d)     Any agreement between You and that third party shall provide that the terms of this Agreement shall prevail over the terms of the agreement between You and that third party.

3.2     If You license use of a domain name to a third party, then:  
    a)     You remain responsible for providing Your own full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical and administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name; and,  
    b)     You shall remain liable for harm caused by the wrongful use of the domain name, unless You disclose the current contact information provided by the licensee and the identity of the licensee within seven (7) days to a party providing You with reasonable evidence of actionable harm.

3.3     You shall provide notices and obtain consents equivalent to those enumerated under Part II (Privacy Policy) from any third-party individual whose personal data You supply to Dynadot.

3.4     You represent that, to the best of Your knowledge and belief, neither Your registration of a domain name nor the manner in which a domain name under Your control is directly or indirectly used shall result in the infringement of the legal rights of any third party.

4    DATA PROCESSING & SECURITY

4.1     Dynadot shall not process any personal data collected from You in a way incompatible with the purposes and other limitations about which Dynadot has provided notice to You in accordance with Part II (Privacy Policy).

4.2     You authorize Dynadot to process all account transactions and activities initiated through the use of Your account. You shall pay all fees and assume all liabilities arising from the use of Your account, including but not limited to circumstances these where transactions and/or activities are caused, directly or indirectly, by unauthorized parties.

4.3     You shall forthwith notify Dynadot of any unauthorized use of Your password, Your account, or any other breach of security.

4.4     You shall cooperate with Dynadot's security processes, including but not limited to secret questions and account locking processes, by providing complete, accurate, and truthful information.

4.5     Dynadot may, in its sole and absolute discretion, log off, delete, disable, or deactivate any account that is inactive for an extended period of time.

5    FEES

5.2     You shall pay Dynadot's fees only in the currency required by Dynadot and only by way of the payment method required by Dynadot.

5.3     Unless otherwise stated herein, Dynadot shall neither refund nor credit any fee or amount paid.

5.4     An additional USD $15 processing fee shall apply to every wire transfer of an amount below USD $500.

5.6     An additional fee, as stated on this website or App, shall apply for requests to Dynadot to reset the email address associated with Your account.

5.7     Additional fees may apply for processing of Services by means other than by email or electronically and for responding to and handing of disputes requiring legal action.

5.8     You may deposit funds in Your account ("Pre-Pay") against which Dynadot shall credit its fees. No Pre-Pay amount is refundable unless otherwise stated herein.

5.9     An additional USD $20 processing fee, or as otherwise stated on this website or App, shall apply to every instance where Your check or other order for the payment of money is returned unpaid for any reason.

5.10     Dynadot may charge its fees against Your credit card or other payment service on Your account.

5.11     In order to use the direct debit functionality of our application, you must open a "Dwolla Account" provided by Dwolla, Inc. and you must accept the Dwolla Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Any funds held in or transferred through your Dwolla Account are held or transferred by Dwolla's financial institution partners. You must be at least 18 years old to create a Dwolla Account. You authorize us to collect and share with Dwolla your personal information including full name, email address and financial information, and you are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of that data. You understand that you will access and manage your Dwolla Account through our application, and Dwolla account notifications will be sent by us, not Dwolla. We will provide customer support for your Dwolla Account activity.

5.12     A Make Offer Fee shall be refunded only as a credit on Your account. A Make Offer Fee shall only be credited back to Your account if the registrant of the respective domain name or its agent does not respond to You or Your agent within 30 days of You or Your agent placing an offer via Dynadot's Make Offer Service. For the purpose of this section, any response by the registrant or its agent, including but not limited to a response rejecting Your offer or refusing to further communicate with You or Your agent, shall be be deemed a response disentitling You from a refund for the Make Offer Fee credit.

6    RENEWAL

6.1     Dynadot disclaims all warranties, express or implied, respecting the fee applicable to and the length of the renewal of any Service or portion thereof.

6.2     You shall be solely responsible for maintaining your own records and reminders respecting the expiry of any Service or portion thereof.

6.3     If You opt-in for automatic renewal of a Service but Dynadot is unable to process a transaction, then the automatic renewal shall not occur.

6.4     Every domain name renewal transaction is final, irreversible, non-refundable and ineligible for account credit.

7    DISPUTES

7.1     For the adjudication of disputes concerning or arising from use of a domain name, You shall submit, without prejudice to other potentially applicable jurisdictions, to:  
    a)     The jurisdiction of the courts of Your domicile; and,  
    b)     The jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.

7.2     Your registration of a domain name shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to:  
    a)     Any consensus policy, specification, policy, procedure, program, bylaw and associated amendments issued by ICANN ("ICANN Rule"); and,  
    b)     Any Dynadot, registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with any ICANN Rule concerning (1) the correction of mistakes by Dynadot or the domain name's registry operator in registering the domain name or (2) the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.

7.3     Unless otherwise stated herein, Dynadot may, in its sole and absolute discretion:  
    a)     Refuse to provide or cease providing any Service or portion thereof;  
    b)     Refuse to affect any transaction on Your account;  
    c)     Delete, suspend, cancel, terminate, or otherwise interrupt any Service and/or Your account where such Service or account is used in connection with a morally objectionable activity, including but not limited to spam, fraud, illegal activity, defamation, slander, harassment, obscenity, profanity, indecency, deceptive practices, tortuous behavior, racism, bigotry, hatred, vulgarity, invasion of privacy, impersonation, intellectual property infringement, trademark infringement, copyright infringement, counterfeiting, piracy, unsolicited bulk e-mailing, phishing, pharming use of botnets, malware, any harm or threat of harm to a third party or to Dynadot, any activity contrary to applicable law and any activity or material deemed objectionable by Dynadot, in its absolute and sole discretion ("Objectionable Use Activity");  
    d)     Delete, suspend, cancel, terminate, or otherwise interrupt any Service and/or Your account while investigating whether Your account is used in connection with any Objectionable Use Activity; and,  
    e)     Treat any Objectionable Use Activity as a termination of this Agreement and deny any request for account credit and/or refund.

8    RESTORATION OF AN EXPIRED DOMAIN

8.1     Any domain name that is not renewed prior to its expiration date shall enter a post-expiration period ("Post-Expiration Period"), during which:
