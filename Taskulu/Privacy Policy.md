Taskulu Privacy Policy
======================

The privacy of your data is very important to us. We’ll only ever access your account with your permission to help you with a problem or fix a software bug. We’ll never open any uploaded files unless you specificly ask us to.

[Identity and access](#identity-and-access) [Law enforcement](#law-enforcement) [Encryption](#encryption) [Deleted data](#deleted-data) [Cookie usage](#cookie-usage) [Changes and questions](#changes-and-questions)

Identity and access

When you sign up for Taskulu, we ask for your email address. If you sign up using Google or Github, we’ll also get your name from the respective service. It’s just so we can personalize your new account and that we can send you invoices, updates and other essential information. We’ll never sell your personal info to other third parties and we won’t use your name or company in a marketing statement without your permission either.

When you write to Taskulu with a question or to ask for help, we’ll keep that correspondence and the email address for future reference.

When you visit our marketing pages, we track that for statistical purposes (like testing new designs and optimizing conversion rates). We also keep any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.

The only times we’ll ever share your info:

* To provide products or services you’ve asked for – with your permission.
* To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.
* If Taskulu is acquired by or merged with another company we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Law enforcement

Taskulu won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We flat out reject requests from local or international law enforcement when they seek data without a court order, and unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.

Encryption

All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when sent from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. Data is not encrypted while it lives in our database, but we go to great lengths to secure your data.

Deleted data

When you cancel your account, we’ll ensure that none of your data (i.e. everything in the projects you’ve created) is saved on our servers after 30 days. Please note that if you’ve been added to another project and created tasks on the other project, deleting your account won’t delete those tasks as they are considered part of a project that’s owned by someone else.
