Refusing to opt in or opting out will not affect your use of our Services.

To learn more about how Google uses data, visit Google’s page on “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ websites or apps.” You may download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for each web browser you use, but this does not prevent the use of other analytics tools.

####   
6\. How long do we keep Personal Information?

  
We will retain each category of your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in the _How We Use Personal Information_ section above, unless otherwise required by applicable laws. Criteria we will use to determine how long we will retain your Personal Information include whether we need your Personal Information to provide you with our Services you have requested; we continue to have a relationship with you; you have requested information or Services from us; we have a legal right or obligation to continue to retain your Personal Information; we have an obligation to a third party that involves your Personal Information; our retention or recordkeeping policies and obligations dictate that we retain your Personal Information; we have an interest in providing you with Personal Information about our Services; and we have another business purpose for retaining your Personal Information.

####   
7\. How we protect your Personal Information?

  
We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information we process, including by maintaining appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are designed to help protect Personal Information collected or received through our Websites or that you otherwise communicate to us.           
We limit access to your Personal Information to our employees whom we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information to provide our Services to you or in order to do their jobs.           
We also implemented a comprehensive set of policies and practices to protect your Personal Information. These measures take into account the volume, sensitivity, intended use, and format of the information, and generally include the following:           
 

* A privacy framework governing the protection of Personal Information throughout its lifecycle. This framework defines, among other things, the roles and responsibilities of our personnel, provides a process for handling privacy complaints, and addresses the retention and destruction of Personal Information;
* Other internal policies and procedures that define the roles and responsibilities of our personnel throughout the information life cycle and limit their access to such information on a “need-to-know” basis;
* When information is collected or stored in electronic format, technical safeguards such as encryption, firewalls, passwords, antivirus software and similar measures;
* A designated Privacy Officer to monitor compliance with applicable data protection laws; and
* Employee privacy and data security training.

However, despite these efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information during its transmission or its storage on our systems.

####

####   
13\. Exercising Your Individual Privacy Rights

  
To exercise any of the privacy rights afforded to you under applicable data protection laws, please submit a request to us by one of the following methods:

* E-mailing us at legal-department@o2ebrands.com
* Calling us toll-free

You will not be discriminated against by virtue of your exercise of the rights listed in this Privacy Notice which means we will not deny goods or Services to you, provide different prices or rates for goods or Services to you, or provide a different level or quality of goods or Services to you. Only you, or an authorized agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.

     
We must verify your identity before fulfilling your requests, and we cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot confirm the Personal Information relates to you. If we cannot initially verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the verification process. We will only use Personal Information provided in a request to verify the requestor’s identity. If you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we will also need to verify your identity, which may require proof of your written authorization or evidence of a power of attorney. We endeavor to respond to requests within the time period required by applicable law. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. 

If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

  
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your requests unless it is excessive or repetitive. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

  
We may deny certain requests, or only fulfill some in part, as permitted or required by applicable law. For example, if you request to delete Personal Information, we may retain Personal Information that we need to retain for legal purposes.
