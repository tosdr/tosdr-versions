Cookies Policy
--------------

_Last updated: June 26, 2024_

1\. Introduction
----------------

A cookie is a small file sent from a website and stored on your computer or mobile device, to keep some configuration or tracking information locally. In the following we will explain what data we process through cookies, why we use cookies on our websites and who processes the data in addition to Opera.

2\. Categories of Data that are collected through cookies
---------------------------------------------------------

**Visitor behavior and engagement.** This includes information on your navigation on the site, interaction with campaign and embedded content and what pages are visited.

**Visit frequency and duration.** This includes information such as whether it’s your first visit, number of visits to the website by you and all users, date of your most recent visit, average time spent on the website or whether the website is left straight away.

**Marketing campaign performance.** This involves measuring how successful our marketing campaigns are in attracting more new users.

**Device data and preferences.** This includes the visitor’s device, IP address, settings, and preferences like language.

3\. Why we use cookies
----------------------

We use cookies for three main purposes:

3.1. **Making browsing more convenient for you**

We use cookies which remember your preferences and settings, detect whether you have consented to cookies or not, adjust website settings according to the format of your system, enable content and functionality like sharing buttons and logging in, distinguish between humans and bots, and contain expiry dates for other cookies.

For instance, we can use your IP address (which is your unique license plate online) to detect your country so that the browser can display content in your language. This is possible because the IP address reveals which country you are connecting from. If you choose another language manually, we use a cookie to store that preference. This can be relevant for instance if you travel abroad, and access through an IP address in a country with a language other than the one you prefer.

For certain subdomains like addons.opera.com or forums.opera.com or auth.opera.com we use an authorization cookie. This cookie is set after you sign in to the website with your username and password. The purpose of this cookie is to make authentication more convenient for you, keeping you signed in so you don’t have to do it every time you open your browser.

3.2. **Marketing**

We use some cookies to promote our products and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns in attracting new users. This happens when you click on an ad for the Opera browser on, for example, Facebook, and are taken to Opera’s own websites. A tracking pixel tells us how many users have clicked on such an ad and further, how many of those who clicked on the ad actually downloaded Opera. This data informs us how successful a marketing campaign has been on a certain website, or even across multiple websites, which in turn helps us to continue to provide a high-quality, independent browser.

3.3. **Statistics and analytics**

We use some cookies to compile statistical reports and analytics, which we use to improve our websites and services. For example, we use Google Analytics to optimize our websites. Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze how our webpages are used, generating statistics about the total number of visitors to our websites, what pages are visited most, what webpage they are coming from, and at what time the webpages are visited the most. This is possible by establishing a unique Analytics ID for your device, the first time you visit our pages. This information can also be used for marketing campaigns.
