Cookies allow us to track use, infer browsing preferences, and improve and customize your browsing experience.
    2. Persistence. We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our websites. Persistent cookies remain on your computer when you have gone offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser. A website may set a cookie if the browser’s preferences allow it. A browser only permits a website to access the cookies that it has set, not those set by other websites.
    3. Types.
        * Essential. These cookies are necessary for our website to work as intended.
        * Functional. These cookies enable enhanced functionality, like videos and live chat. Without these cookies, certain functions may become unavailable.

11. Third Party Application Stores: Third party application stores, such as Apple’s App Store or Google’s Google Play, might collect additional information and share them with us. Please refer to the application store’s Privacy Policy to better understand how they process any of the Personal Data they collect and share with app publishers like ourselves.
12. Information Protection and Retention.
    1. Information Protection. We maintain administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for Personal Data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, loss, and misuse. These security measures include access controls, encryption, and firewalls. We are certified as a PCI DSS Level 1 compliant service provider, which is the highest level of compliance available, and our platform is audited annually by independent third-party qualified security assessors against the ISO 27001 security standard. Unfortunately, no method of Internet use, data transmission, or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of Personal Data.
    2. Your Responsibilities. While we are dedicated to securing our Website and services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your passwords and account information. We are not responsible for protecting Personal Data shared with a third-party based on an account connection that you have authorized. 
    3. Retention. We use and retain your Personal Data for, and as long as, necessary for the purpose for which it was provided, including any purposes set for in this Privacy Policy (e.g., for services, products, or interactions that you have requested or initiated; for communications with you; for invoicing, advertising, and marketing; for improving user experience, such as troubleshooting, optimization, and personalization; and to comply with legal, contractual, and regulatory obligations). We may also use and retain information for other purposes where you have given consent, such as in response to a pricing or hiring inquiry, or where a legitimate commercial interest exists. 
13. Accountability and Safeguards for Onward Transfer. 
    1. Data Transfer. We provide services around the world. To provide our services, it may be necessary to transmit Personal Data outside of the country, state, or province where the data was received, including to the United States in circumstances where BigCommerce acts as Controller. Such international data transfers may involve the flow of data from certain countries or regions to others that have different, and potentially less protective, privacy laws. To account for this, BigCommerce strives to maintain appropriate internal and external data protections, including (i) relying on legally or contractually adequate mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders in accordance with applicable laws; and (ii) obligating third parties, including applicable Processors and vendors, to provide at least the same level of data protection and use restriction as maintained by BigCommerce and required by applicable laws.
    2. Standard Contractual Clauses. For third-country transfers outside of the EU/EEA we also use the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the EU Commission in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 as an adequate level of protection. We use these Standard Contractual Clauses as modified by the UK International Data Transfer Addendum for data transfers outside of the UK.
    3. Remedial Measures. If we learn Personal Data is not protected according to our contract, or is being processed beyond your consent, we will take reasonable steps to protect your information and/or cease its illegitimate processing.
14. Data Privacy Framework. ﻿[](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/european-individuals) BigCommerce has certified the following entities for compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks: 1\. BigCommerce, Inc. 2\. BigCommerce Holdings, Inc. As part of the Data Privacy Frameworks, BigCommerce complies with, and is a member of, the EU-U.S. (including the U.K. extension) and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively the “Data Privacy Frameworks”) regarding the collection, use, retention, and onward transfer of Personal Data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Data Privacy Frameworks, the Data Privacy Frameworks shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Frameworks, and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce site at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/). In accordance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, BigCommerce: (i) is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission; (ii) may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; and (iii) may be liable in cases of onward transfers to third parties. BigCommerce also commits to periodically reviewing and verifying the accuracy of this Privacy Policy and the company’s compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, and remedying issues identified. All employees of BigCommerce that have access to Personal Data covered by this Privacy Policy are responsible for conducting themselves in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Failure of a BigCommerce employee to comply with this Privacy Policy may result in disciplinary action. For additional information on how to contact BigCommerce or initiate a Data Privacy Framework complaint for third-party dispute resolution, please refer to Section 16. If your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under certain conditions a binding arbitration option may be available before a Data Privacy Framework panel. For additional information, please visit [Data Privacy Framework.](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/european-individuals) ﻿
15. Data Subject Rights. 
    1. Generally. Under applicable law, you may have the ability to exercise certain rights over your Personal Data. Because BigCommerce values your Privacy, we strive to provide reasonable steps to allow you to access, rectify, erase, port, and restrict or object to the use of your Personal Data regardless of whether a specific statutory right to do so exists. When collection is based on your consent, we attempt to provide you with notice at collection and the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal by applicable law. If permitted by applicable law, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory or regulatory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data infringes your rights. Exercise of certain rights, including requests for deletion of Personal Data, may be limited in certain circumstances and may adversely affect our ability to serve you.
    2. Merchants, Partners, and Visitors. Merchants and Partners are able to update and control many types of Personal Data collected by BigCommerce directly within their accounts. Please contact us if you are a Visitor or otherwise unable to access or otherwise change your Personal Data within your account.
    3. Shoppers. We serve as a Processor for Merchants. Shoppers may wish to contact Merchants directly regarding their Personal Data, as Merchants act as Controllers over such Personal Data. When appropriately identified, we can forward Shopper requests for access or deletion to Merchants, but we are unable to delete Merchant data.
    4. Laws that may grant particular rights. Several jurisdictions have enacted privacy laws to codify certain rights for their residents. The goals and requirements of these laws are consistent with our longstanding commitment to data protection and transparency, including the general principles, disclosures, and data subject rights articulated in this Privacy Policy. These laws include, but are not limited to:
        * The General Data Protection Regulation EU (2016/679)(GDPR)
        * The Brazil Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)

        * The Colorado Privacy Act
        * The Connecticut Data Protection Act
        * The Utah Consumer Privacy Act
        * The Nevada Privacy Law Depending on the jurisdiction, these laws provide individuals with rights to:
        * Access or know about their information
        * Correct their information, if inaccurate
        * Delete or erase their information
        * Opt-out if a business “sells” their information or uses or “shares” it for certain advertising purposes
        * Control how a business uses their sensitive information
        * Be notified about a business’s data practices
        * Restrict or object to certain types of processing
