BigCommerce will have no obligation to monitor the Discussion Areas, but may do so at its discretion and may delete, move, or edit any information or materials in the Discussion Areas.
8. Arbitration Agreement, Class Action Waiver and Mediation.
    1. Purpose. This Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver (“Arbitration Agreement”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and BigCommerce. For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, “BigCommerce” means BigCommerce, Inc., a Texas corporation, and each of its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. This Arbitration Agreement applies to these Terms and any other agreement you may have with BigCommerce. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial. You have the right to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all disputes between you and BigCommerce will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law). The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and BigCommerce regarding any aspect of your relationship with BigCommerce, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
    2. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. For all Disputes you must first give BigCommerce an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to: Legal Department BigCommerce, Inc. 11305 Four Points Drive Building II, First Floor Austin, TX 78726 That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of the Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If BigCommerce does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.
    3. Arbitration Procedures. If this Arbitration Agreement applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or BigCommerce may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration. All issues will be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.For arbitration before the AAA, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection will apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Arbitration Agreement governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action, representative action, or collective action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because your contract with BigCommerce, these Terms, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), if applicable, governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
    4. Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out. Notwithstanding the above, you or BigCommerce may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court or equivalent in the applicable jurisdiction; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to: Legal Department BigCommerce, Inc. 11305 Four Points Drive Building II, First Floor Austin, TX 78726 Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with BigCommerce through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with BigCommerce. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.
    5. Arbitration Award. The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator’s award will be in writing, will be signed by the arbitrator, and will include a determination of all the questions submitted to the arbitrator the decision of which is necessary in order to determine the controversy. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by law, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
    6. Location of Arbitration. You may initiate arbitration in the federal judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. In the event that BigCommerce initiates an arbitration, it may only do so in the federal judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution or the billing address for your account.
    7. Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs. BigCommerce will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded by the arbitrator as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with BigCommerce as provided in the “Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution” Section and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover from BigCommerce your actual and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
    8. Class Action Waiver. The parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and BigCommerce specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration. Neither you, nor any other user of the Services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.
    9. Limitation of Procedural Rights. You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and BigCommerce are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and BigCommerce might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). You give up those rights, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. The right to appellate review of an arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.
    10. Severability. If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.
    11. Continuation. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your contract with BigCommerce and your use of the Services.
9. Anti-Corruption, Export and Sanctions Compliance. With respect to these Terms, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you:
    1. have not and will not violate, or cause any party to be in violation of, any applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption law (including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute in 18 U.S.C. 201, the U.S. Travel Act, or the UK Bribery Act 2010), anti-kickback laws, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws, sanctions, embargoes, export controls, import controls, anti-fraud laws, or any other applicable law, regulation, or order (collectively, “Applicable ABAC Laws”);
    2. have not and will not use or apply the Services or the Website in violation of Applicable ABAC Laws;
    3. have not and will not with a corrupt, improper, or illegal intention directly or indirectly (through third parties) pay, provide, promise, offer, authorize, solicit, or accept any money, gift, hospitality, entertainment, favor, financial advantage, or other thing of value to or from any individual, organization, political party, or entity whether in the public or private sector in any country in order to obtain, retain, or direct regulatory approvals, licenses, permits, business, contracts, investments, sales, tax or duty assessments, import or export clearances, foreign exchange clearances, or other advantages;
    4. shall cause all of your employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, vendors, and partners (collectively, “Relevant Parties”) to comply with all of the terms contained in this Anti-Corruption, Export and Sanctions Compliance Section;

    5. Confidentiality.
        1. Definition. “Confidential Information” means the business, technical and financial information disclosed to one party (the “Receiving Party”) by the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) pursuant to these Terms and includes all information marked by the Disclosing Party as confidential and any other information, whether written or oral, that the Receiving Party should reasonably understand is confidential to the Disclosing Party.
        2. Obligations. The Receiving Party will: (i) hold the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in trust and confidence and not disclose or release the Confidential Information to any third party except as provided in these Terms; and (ii) not use the Confidential Information for any purpose except for the purposes described in these Terms. The disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to these Terms is not intended in any way to transfer or grant any right, title or interest in or to such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party unless otherwise expressly indicated by the Disclosing Party in writing.
        3. Standard of Care. The standard of care imposed on each party pursuant to this Section will be the same degree of care as it uses to avoid the unauthorized use, disclosure, or dissemination of its own Confidential Information of a similar nature, but not less than a commercially reasonable degree of care.
        4. Limitation. Each party will disclose the Confidential Information of the other party only to those of its employees, consultants and contractors (“Personnel”) who have agreed, either as a condition of employment, representation or in a written agreement, to be bound by terms and conditions substantially as protective as the confidentiality terms and conditions applicable to the Receiving Party under this Section.
        5. Exclusions. Confidential Information excludes information that is (i) rightfully in the Receiving Party’s possession without obligation of confidentiality prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, (ii) a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party, (iii) rightfully furnished to the Receiving Party by a third party without restriction on disclosure or use; or (iv) independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.﻿
        6. Requests for Confidential Information. A Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a valid court order or order of an authorized government agency, provided that (if not legally prohibited) the Receiving Party has given the Disclosing Party prompt notice so that the Disclosing Party will have an opportunity to defend, limit or protect against such disclosure and the Receiving Party limits such disclosure to only that Confidential Information subject to the applicable order.
        7. Survival. The terms of this Section will survive for as long as the Confidential Information remains confidential.
    6. Backup Storage. For its own operational efficiencies and purposes, BigCommerce from time to time back up data on its servers, but is under no obligation or duty to you to do so under these Terms or otherwise. IT IS SOLELY YOUR DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO BACKUP SEPARATELY YOUR FILES AND DATA THAT MAY RESIDE ON BIGCOMMERCE SERVERS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BIGCOMMERCE BE LIABLE TO YOU, YOUR USERS, OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, FOR LOSS OF FILES AND/OR DATA ON ANY BIGCOMMERCE SERVER.
    7. No Assignment by You. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of BigCommerce, which BigCommerce may refuse in its sole discretion. Any attempted assignment without prior written consent from BigCommerce will be deemed null and void. BigCommerce may assign its rights and/or obligations under these Terms at any time. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.
    8. Entire Agreement. These Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and any modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein.
11. Miscellaneous.
    1. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. The law that will govern the validity and construction of these Terms and apply in any dispute or lawsuit arising out of or relating to these Terms is as set forth in table in the Contracting Entity Section above. YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO, AND WAIVE ALL DEFENSES OF LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND FORUM NON CONVENIENS WITH RESPECT TO, THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS LOCATED IN TRAVIS COUNTY, TEXAS (USA). The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms and is hereby expressly excluded.
    2. Severability. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
    3. Waiver. No waiver of any provision of these Terms, nor consent by BigCommerce to the breach of or departure from any provision of these Terms, will in any event be binding on or effective against BigCommerce unless it be in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of BigCommerce, and then such waiver will be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.
    4. Notices.
        1. You consent to receive electronically any communications from BigCommerce. We may communicate with you through the email address specified in your account or by posting notices on the Website. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that are provided to you electronically satisfy any requirement that such communications be in writing.

        2. Notices to BigCommerce must be sent to: trustandsafety@bigcommerce.com.
    5. Section Headings. The section headings and titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms will be interpreted without application of any strict construction in favor of or against you or BigCommerce.
    6. Independent Contractors. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment relationship is created by these Terms or your use of the Services, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind BigCommerce in any respect whatsoever.
    7. Marks. BigCommerce shall have the non-exclusive right and license to use the names, trademarks, service marks and logos associated with your store(s) to promote the Services.
    8. Force Majeure. BigCommerce will have no liability to you, your users, or any third party for any failure by BigCommerce to perform its obligations under these Terms in the event that such non-performance arises as a result of the occurrence of an event beyond the reasonable control of BigCommerce, including, without limitation, an act of war or terrorism, natural disaster, failure of electricity supply, riot, civil disorder, or civil commotion or other force majeure event.
    9. Third-Party Service Integration. Certain Third-Party Products may be integrated with the Services. BigCommerce may, in its discretion and without liability to you, decide to no longer support such integration and migrate your Services subscription to a different integration. BigCommerce may from time to time recommend, provide access to, link to, or enable Third-Party Products. Such Third-Party Products are owned and controlled by a third party entity whom BigCommerce has no ownership or control over (“Third-Party Product Provider”). Third-Party Products are made available for your convenience and any purchase, use of, or access to such Third-Party Products is solely between you and the Third- Party Product Provider. When accessing, enabling, or otherwise engaging Third-Party Products you are agreeing to be bound by the additional terms provided by the Third-Party Product Provider with whom you are engaging. It is your responsibility to understand the terms and conditions and/ or privacy policy of any Third-Party Products you are accessing, linking to, or otherwise engaging prior to any engagement with that Third-Party Product Provider.
