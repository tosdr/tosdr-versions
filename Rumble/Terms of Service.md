In that instance, Rumble reserves the right to demand that you defend and indemnify it as to such claims, which you hereby agree to do.

In the case where you have chosen either Option "A" or Option "B", by submitting Content to Rumble, you are irrevocably agreeing to appoint Rumble as your sole, worldwide, exclusive and perpetual Agent with respect to the Content and all rights pertaining thereto, including without limitation, all rights enumerated in United States Code, Title 17, Â§ 106, and you herein authorize and grant Rumble the exclusive authority to make all decisions and take all actions Rumble deems reasonably appropriate with respect to the management, commercial and non-commercial monetization of the Content under the terms of this Agreement.

Rumble shall not be liable to you or any third party for any delay or defect in it attempt to register the copyright in any Content, or if Rumble does not attempt to register such Copyright.

In the case where you have chosen either Option "A" or Option "B", as your Agent in respect of the Content, Rumble may choose in its exclusive and absolute unfettered and/or arbitrary commercial discretion to pursue any legal remedies available in order to, as your Agent, assert or enforce your (or if you are entering into this Agreement under authority of a third party rights holder, that third party's) copyright or other intellectual property rights in and to the Content, including but not limited to making a claim or commencing legal proceedings with respect to all payments owing to you by third parties with respect to infringement of the Content, and you agree to fully cooperate in same (or if you are entering into this Agreement under authority of a third party rights holder, you agree to procure the cooperation of such third party). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Rumble shall at no time and in no manner be obliged to make any efforts as your Agent pursuant to this provision. You hereby appoint Rumble as your (or if you are entering into this Agreement under authority of a third-party rights holder, that third-party's) attorney in fact for executing any instrument or document or taking any step in furtherance of the rights granted herein.

Where Rumble as Agent takes steps to enforce the copyright in your Content or breach of a license agreement on your behalf as Principal, or where the law allows Rumble (as an agent having a pecuniary interest in the subject matter and outcome of the suit) to file suit in its own name as your agent), or whether directly by way of the Assignment Option, as defined below, or otherwise, Rumble shall have sole control and decision-making power over any demand, claim, proceeding or settlement. If required by applicable law that you be a named plaintiff in any such enforcement action relating to your Content, you hereby so consent to be so named. In that instance, Rumble will continue to have sole control of the action as described above, will continue to pay all fees and costs incurred in that action, and you agree to cooperate with Rumble with respect to such action.

It is understood and agreed that any C-Suite officer (CEO, COO, CTO, CFO) of Rumble may execute documents pursuant to, and exercise for Rumble, any power of attorney you have granted to Rumble herein.

#### Recovery Through Copyright Enforcement

You, or if you are entering into this Agreement under authority of a third party rightsholder, that third party, shall not issue any demand, or commence any claim or proceedings to enforce any rights in any Content submitted to Rumble under Agency Option "A" or Agency Option "B", except with Rumble's express authorization which may be denied in the event that Rumble elects to assume carriage and control of such enforcement measures, and in such event Rumble shall indemnify and hold you (or the applicable third party rightsholder) harmless from and against any damages, legal fees and costs, directly attributable to such enforcement measures. If, however, Rumble authorizes you to take enforcement action, then you will be solely responsible for all fees, costs, damages or other expenses in that action.

#### Recovery by Rumble as Agent

In the event that any claim or demand is made by Rumble or if legal proceedings are commenced by Rumble on your behalf and in your name as your Agent (as opposed to Rumble being the copyright owner pursuant to the Assignment Option as set out below) and such claim, demand, or proceeding results in a payment from a third party to Rumble, Rumble shall be entitled to deduct from such proceeds: a) all associated legal fees and expenses incurred or payable by Rumble; and b) if the payment amount exceeds the subsection (a) amount by at least USD $1,000.00, a management and enforcement fee equal to the remainder of the proceeds less the sum of USD $1,000.00, meaning that the maximum that you can receive in such event is USD $1,000.00.

### RUMBLE'S OPTION TO ACQUIRE CONTENT COPYRIGHT VIA ASSIGNMENT UNDER OPTION "A" or OPTION "B"

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in the case where you have chosen either Option "A" or Option "B" only, if Rumble determines that it requires your copyright to be assigned to Rumble along with all related claims and causes of action (collectively, "Copyrights"), so as to enable Rumble to have standing to enforce the Copyrights against a third party, then Rumble shall have the option at any time, in consideration of the Copyright Assignment Fee (as defined below) to cause and consummate such assignment of Copyrights to Rumble, and this Agreement shall be your written instrument effecting same (the "Assignment Option"). Alternatively, if you are entering into this Agreement under authority of a third party rightsholder as may be permitted herein, you represent and warrant that you have authority herein to agree to same on behalf of such third-party rights holder.

If you have chosen either Option "A" or Option "B" only, you hereby appoint Rumble as your Attorney in Fact as to any such Assignment, and grant to Rumble the actual authority, right and permission, as your Attorney in Fact, the execute a separate Assignment document in the following form:

"For Value Received, the sufficiency of which is acknowledged, \[your name\], an individual residing in the state of \[your state of residence\] ("Assignor") hereby assigns all copyright in \[description of the Content being assigned\] (the "Content") to Rumble, Inc. ("Assignee"). Assignor represents and warrants that a copyright exists in the Content, that Assignor owns all right, title and interest in and to that copyright, that the copyright has not been previously assigned or licensed, that Assignor has the right to assign the copyright in the Content to Assignee, that there is no dispute or potential dispute of which Assignor is aware regarding the copyright in the Content or Assignor's ownership thereof and right to assign to Assignor; and that Assignee may hereafter register the copyright in Assignee's name. This Assignment includes assigning to Assignee the sole right to seek, recover and retain any and all damages (and related forms of recovery and relief) for past, present and future infringement of the assigned copyright, without notice or accounting to Assignor.

			Executed this \_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 20\_\_, at Toronto, Canada.

				By: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
					Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
					Title: Rumble \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
					Attorney in Fact for \[your name\].

		

In the case where you have chosen either Option "A" or Option "B", and if Rumble so requests, you shall cooperate in executing any additional instruments or assignments of Copyrights (and related claims) reasonably required to give effect to the assignment, transfer and enforcement of the Copyrights in the Content (or if you are entering into this Agreement under authority of a third party rights holder, you agree to procure the cooperation of such third party). In the case where you have chosen either Option "A" or Option "B", you hereby appoint Rumble as your (or if you are entering into this Agreement under authority of a third party rights holder, that third party's) attorney in fact for executing on your or their behalf any instrument or assignment reasonably required to give effect to this provision and to effect the assignment and transfer of Copyrights.

The Copyright Assignment Fee payable by Rumble to you shall be the combination of:

1. the maximum publicly available licensing fee for your Content as displayed in the Rumble catalogue, to a maximum of USD $500; and
2. an additional USD $500.00 in consideration of the assignment.

Upon assignment of Copyright in accordance with these provisions, all right, title, interest, and goodwill, together with the right to pursue and collect damages for all past, present, and future claims and causes of action in relation to enforcing intellectual property rights in and to the Content, including but not limited to Rumble's exclusive right to seek, recover and retain all past, present and future damages, attorneys' fees, enhanced or punitive damages, license fees, and/or royalties related to the Content, shall be transferred to Rumble.

### COLLECTION OF EARNINGS

As Agent, Rumble is authorized to collect any applicable earnings ("Earnings") derived from the publication, licensing, display and/or other use (collectively, the "Use") of your Content on your behalf pursuant to this Agreement. The Earnings payable to you after deducting applicable amounts are referred to herein and defined as the "Creator Earnings".

Creator Earnings are calculated by applying the applicable Agency Fee (see table below) to the Earnings and then deducting any applicable third-party processing fees, administrative fees, and/or any amounts that may be due to a Rumble publisher/syndication partner, hosting costs, taxes, defensive litigation costs, exchanges rates, and/or any other direct costs (collectively "Other Fees and Costs"). Notwithstanding, Rumble reserves the right to apply the Agency Fee and/or abstain from deducting Other Fees and Costs in a manner that it determines is appropriate in its sole discretion, but in any case not in a manner that reduces the amount of Creator Earnings payable to you as currently set forth herein.

Agency Fees:

| Revenue Stream | Rumble Agency Fee |
| --- | --- |
| Programmatic Advertisement | Forty percent (40%) |
| Sponsorship (incl. Host-Read) Advertisement | Forty percent (40%) |
| Licensing | Forty percent (40%) |
| Tipping/Donation | Twenty percent (20%) |
| Pay-Per-View | Twenty percent (20%) |

As used herein:

Programmatic Advertisement revenue stream means advertising revenues generated from users watching video Content on the Platform.

Sponsorship (including Host-Read) Advertisement revenue stream means advertising revenue generated from a Content creator performing an advertisement placement within their Content.

Licensing revenue stream means revenue generated when exclusivity has been authorized to Rumble to license Content to other platforms.

Tipping/Donation revenue stream means revenue generated from users contributing a fixed dollar amount in return for their message being promoted by a creator during the creatorâs Content stream.

Pay-Per-View revenue stream means revenue generated by Content creators making available pay-per-view video Content for viewing by their audience for a limited time or on a one-time basis.

You understand that, from time to time, Rumble may change and/or add additional revenue streams and change and/or add additional Agency Fees. In the event of any such changes, this Agreement will be updated accordingly, and the most recent version of this Agreement will apply to Rumbleâs Use of your Content and the collection and payment of any Earnings hereunder.

All payments to you of Creator Earnings will normally be remitted to your Rumble account thirty (30) days after the month in which Rumble receives payment on your behalf from third parties for the Use of your Content.

If an upfront payment amount is provided for under this Agreement, the entire amount indicated will be issued to your Rumble account. Your future Creator Earnings, will be applied against this upfront payment until the upfront payment amount is fully utilized.

The first month for which payment is to be made shall: (a) begin on the first day of the month following the month of execution of this Agreement; and (b) include the portion of the month of execution following the Effective Date (unless this Agreement was executed on the first day of a month, in which case the month shall be deemed to begin on the first day of such month).

Under certain circumstances, third parties may make payments to Rumble that do not associate Earnings with the Use of specific Content. In this event, Rumble will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify the Creator Earnings due to you for the Use of your Content. If, after 24 months from the date of payment by a third party, Rumble has not been able to identify Earnings to the Use of specific Content, Rumble reserves the right to retain all such payments.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Creator Earnings are payable in relation to Rumble Premium Subscriptions, as defined below.

### EARNING PAYMENT REDUCTIONS / SET-OFFS

Payments may be subject to reduction to offset bad debts, refunds and other charge-backs relating to Use of your Content within sixty (60) days of the payment to which the bad debt, chargeback or refund relates.

### LIABILITY

Rumble does not in any way endorse any Content submitted, including any opinion, recommendation, claims, advice or position expressed therein, and Rumble expressly disclaims all liability in connection with the Content and its publication. For the purposes of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or similar legislation or regulations, all Content is considered user-generated content and Rumble's capacity as Agent is not Content owned by Rumble (unless expressly assigned to Rumble under the terms of this Agreement) or uploaded by Rumble.

In order to submit Content to Rumble you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for what is submitted and indemnify and hold Rumble harmless from any and all claims arising from a breach of your representations, warranties, and covenants as set out in this Agreement, and also indemnify and hold Rumble harmless from and against all third party claims with respect to the Content and acting as Agent in respect of the Content.

### RUMBLE PUBLISHER ACCOUNT

If your account qualifies for a Rumble Publisher account, any activity on the Rumble Player using the Monetized Embed Code will apply to your account as follows: as used herein, "Net Advertising Revenues" means aggregate amounts collected by Rumble arising from the license or sale of the pre-roll, mid-roll, post roll or overlay advertisements included within the Rumble Player less any amounts due for hosting, taxes, litigation costs, exchange rates, and any other direct costs. Rumble shall retain all amounts derived from all other advertisements, promotions, links, pointers and similar services or rights. Rumble Publisher is entitled to the Net Advertising Revenue less an Agency fee equal to 50% payable to Rumble, within thirty (30) days following the end of each month whenever a Rumble Publisher uses the Rumble Monetized Embed Code. Analytics will be directly reported into the Publisher Dashboard within your Rumble account.

### Procedure for Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement

* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.Â Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly.
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
* A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

* Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of, at Rumble's discretion, in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice at Toronto or the United States Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in the United States and that you will accept service of process by mail from the person who provided notification of copyright infringement, or an agent of such person.

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers who are repeat infringers.
