This Privacy Policy describes how Rumble Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including but not limited to Rumble Canada Inc. and Locals Technology Inc. (collectively, “Rumble,” or “we” or “us” or “our”) collect, use, and share Personal Information. This Privacy Policy applies to all services offered through our mobile applications, platforms, and websites (collectively, the “Services”), and to any Personal Information obtained from website visitors and users in connection with the Services we provide directly to those users.

We take your privacy seriously. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you access our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our data privacy practices and the choices available to you. By using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. Rumble may choose to update or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, with or without notice to you.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.

### 1\. Information We Collect

We collect your Personal Information based on the purpose for which you provide it to us. “Personal Information” includes any information that we collect about you that, alone or in combination with other information, can be used to identify you, such as a personal identifier (e.g., name, email or postal address, phone number, etc.), online identifiers, or inferences about your preferences. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, Personal Information also includes “Personal Data,” as defined under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or other applicable international data protection laws.

We collect Personal Information in the following situations, as applicable:

1. When you browse our website or use our Services;
2. When you voluntarily provide information directly to us (e.g., when you sign up to become a registered user of our Services or provide content to our platforms); and
3. When you register to join Rumble by logging into an account through a third-party Social Networking Site ("SNS"). Please be advised that if you decide to create your user account by logging into an SNS via the Services, you are using the Personal Information you have already provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your user account on our Services. As a result, the information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you have enabled with the SNS. Please consult that SNS's privacy policy for additional information on their privacy practices.

We collect (or have collected during the preceding 12 months from the date of this Policy) Personal Information that generally falls within one or more of the following categories:

* Direct Identifiers. We collect identifiers such as your real name, alias, email address, phone number, account username and password, photographs, biographical information, and other similar information.
* Protected Classifications. We collect age information based on date of birth.
* Internet Activity. We collect usage and log data about devices you use to access the websites, such as browser type, device manufacturer, operating system, domain name and IP address, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Services, the webpages of our Services that you visit, information you search for on our Services, access times and dates, and other statistics from all website visitors (“Automatically Collected Information”). Our mobile and connected television applications (“App”) provide our users with access to and the use of the Services from their mobile devices or television. We may receive your mobile device model and software version, which allows us to improve the performance of our App.
* Inferences drawn from other Personal Information. We collect Personal Information reflecting personal preferences of users.

### 2\. How We Use Your Information

We may also use the Personal Information we collect as otherwise disclosed to you at the point of collection, or for any other purposes with your consent. We use your Personal Information in the following circumstances:

* Account registration. We create your user account for your use of the Services based upon the Personal Information you provide. You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your account by editing your profile via the Services. If you choose to completely delete all of your Personal Information, your account may be deactivated and our Services may not be available to you. You may also contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy with any request to update, correct, or delete your Personal Information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request.
* Communications. We use your Personal Information to contact you regarding our newsletters, marketing, or promotional materials or other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your account settings. We may use your Personal Information to respond to your questions and/or inquiries.
* To personalize or improve the user experience. We may aggregate your Personal Information with other information collected from other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services, and to analyze and understand how our Services are used. We also use Automatically Collected Information internally to increase our functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our users' needs.
* Fraud detection and prevention. We may use your Personal Information to detect and prevent potential fraud with respect to the Services. For example, we use your mobile phone number to provide you with a one-time verification code to ensure you are not a robot.

### 3\. Information We Disclose to Third Parties

We will only share your Personal Information at your direction, with your consent, or in the following circumstances:

* Other Users. When you register through the Services and submit Personal Information to create a profile, other users will be able to view your username and channel name (if applicable). If you do not want Personal Information to be viewed by others, we recommend that you do not include Personal Information in your username or channel name. Should you choose to provide additional Personal Information (e.g., photos, location data, or biographical information, etc.) as part of your username or channel name, this information may be visible to other users. Sharing additional Personal Information is voluntary and we recommend that you exercise caution in disclosing any information you consider sensitive or confidential.
* Affiliates. We may share your Personal Information with companies under common ownership and control of Rumble, including the parent company and its affiliates.
* Third Party Service Providers. We may retain third party service providers to provide services on our behalf (e.g., maintenance services, web analytics and improvement of the Service's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used, including with certain third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may disclose Automatically Collected Information obtained from your use of the Services to third party service providers who provide services to us.

With your consent to this Privacy Policy, we may also share information regarding the videos that you view through the Services (e.g., video titles, descriptions) along with other information, to assist us and other third parties to provide you with more personalized content, including ads displayed on Rumble as well as other platforms. Your SNS consent preferences may be changed at any time through your SNS account. Please be advised that where your SNS account preferences do not grant consent to share information regarding the videos you view through the Rumble Services, we may still share other Personal Information about you for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy.
* Legal Obligations. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to satisfy our legal obligations. This may include: (i) to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal processor to produce relevant documents or information in connection with litigation, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, government or internal investigations, or other legal or administrative proceedings; (ii) to protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of us, or any of our users, subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, or others; (iii) to monitor compliance with and enforce our Website Terms and Conditions of Use; (iv) to operate the systems that ensures the Services function properly; or (v) if we believe in good faith that a disclosure is necessary. When permitted by law, we will attempt to notify you before we disclose your Personal Information to satisfy our legal obligations.
* Business Transactions. In the event that Rumble goes through a business transition, such as a corporate divestiture, merger, acquisition, joint venture, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or any other similar transaction or proceeding, your Personal Information may be sold, divested, assigned, shared, or otherwise transferred in connection with the proposed transaction. You may opt-out of the transfer of your Personal Information to the successor entity, if that entity has not committed to comply with this Privacy Policy or a privacy policy that is in all material respects as protective of your Personal Information as this Privacy Policy.

We may use and disclose certain aggregated or de-identified information to our affiliates, business partners, and service providers, or through certain aggregated analytics data available through our Services to other users. Such aggregated and/or de-identified information cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

### 4\. Choices Regarding Your Information

* Email Communications. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive email communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your account settings.
* Social Networking Sites. When you log-in through an SNS account, such as Facebook, the privacy policy of that SNS applies to their collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information. In addition, the SNS may collect Personal Information about your activity on the Rumble website for the purpose of providing you with targeted advertising and other services. You may determine whether or not your activity on the Services will be shared and disclosed through the privacy settings on your SNS accounts. Please review the privacy policies of the SNS with whom you engage to better understand the information they collect and the choices you have with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information. You can disable the feature that links your account to a SNS at any time by logging into your SNS account and selecting the option to disable connection to your SNS.

### 5\. Links to Other Websites

Our Services contain links to other third-party websites and online services. If you choose to visit another website or online service by clicking on a link, you will be directed to that third party's website or online service. Other websites and online services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and/or disclosure of Personal Information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites or online services you visit before providing any information or using such websites or services to carefully understand their privacy practices.

### 6\. Data Security

We care about the security of your Personal Information. Rumble maintains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards reasonably designed to guard Personal Information that has been provided to us from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We utilize commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of information collected and maintained through the Service and comply with applicable laws and industry standards to secure and protect information transmitted via or stored through our Services. However, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of information you transmit to our Site.

### 7\. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

“Cookies” are small amounts of data generated by a website and saved by your web browser. Browsers store the data temporarily and return it to the server on subsequent visits or requests. Web beacons are a small image file (usually a transparent 1x1 pixel image) used for tracking purposes. They may be placed in a webpage or HTML email to record when the content was loaded. We use the information collected by web beacons to statistically monitor how many people are using our Services. We utilize both cookies, pixels, and web beacons to help us keep our Services secure, measure the performance of our Services, understand how visitors interact with them, count numbers of visitors, and improve the user experience. For example, cookies, pixels, and web beacons may be embedded in videos or web pages to collect certain types of information from your device or web browser in order to determine if you have viewed a particular video, web page, or advertisement.

In addition to Rumble's use of cookies and web beacons, we have relationships with advertising companies and SNS, including Rumble's own Ad Manager, who may serve ads and/or collect certain information when you visit our web site. These advertising companies typically use a cookie, pixel, or third-party web beacon to collect this information. For example, these companies may use information collected about you (e.g., IP address, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In addition, these advertising companies and SNS may use their own unique identifiers to identify you, and this information may be collected from you by these third parties, consistent with their own privacy policies.

Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but you can control and manage the use of cookies on your browser or device by deleting them from your browser history when you leave our website. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or alert you when a cookie is set on your computer. If you use a mobile device to access our Services, certain information associated with your device may be collected (e.g., browser type, device manufacturer, device model, etc.) and used for purposes similar to cookies. Most mobile devices allow you to disable the ability for geolocation information to be collected from your mobile device. The help function on most browsers and mobile devices contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies, disable cookies entirely, or disable the collection of geolocation data. Please be advised, if you disable certain cookies, some of the features of our website may not function properly or be available to you, such as those which require identification.

Do Not Track Requests. Some web browsers have Do Not Track (“DNT”) or similar features that allow you to tell each website you visit that you do not want your activities on that website tracked. Currently, Rumble does not respond to DNT signals and will continue to collect information about you even if your browser's DNT functionality is activated. By selecting the DNT option on your browser, this may not affect our collection of information related to cookie or other tracking technologies.
