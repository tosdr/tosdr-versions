Privacy Policy
==============

**Who are we?**  
We are Chequered Ink Ltd, a limited company based in the United Kingdom. You can find full details of our registered company number and physical address, and contact us directly, [here](page:86F53D6E-5325-4D54-9C2B-D1D3F8BEEBF6).

**What personal data we collect and why we collect it**  
Below is a list of the personal information that we collect and the cookies we use, separated into categories to help you understand how your personal data is being collected and used.

**Contact forms**  
When you use the contact form on our website it sends an email directly to our support team. This email includes all the information you provided on the form as well as your public IP address. The information sent to us is used purely to help with your support enquiry. We never share this information with third parties unless you explicitly ask us to do so.

**Local Storage**  
We use your browser’s local storage to save your progress in our HTML5 games. You can delete local storage data at any time from your web browser’s settings menu.

**Embedded content from other websites**  
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. YouTube videos, social media buttons, images, articles, adverts etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

**Who we share your data with**  
We do not share any of the data that we collect through our contact form or HTML5 games. This information is for our use only.

**How long we retain your data**  
The data collected through our contact form is stored only as long as it takes for us to deal with your enquiry. Local storage information is stored locally in your browser, and you can delete this at any time in your browser’s settings. The third parties previously described will each have their own data retention policies and you should visit them to find out more.

**What rights you have over your data**  
You can request an archive of your data from us at any time using our contact form. We take your rights very seriously and we will deal with any requests as soon as possible.

**How we protect your data**  
Data you provide via our contact form is sent to our secure email server. We regularly perform security checks on our website to minimise the chance of security breaches. Your data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required. Local storage information is stored on your device, not on our servers.

**What data breach procedures we have in place**  
We regularly check for breaches to the security of our website. Should any breach become apparent we will immediately act to prevent further damage by securing our servers and we will inform all users that there has been a breach – even if their data wasn’t specifically affected. We will do this via email (if we have a user’s email on file) and by public announcement.

**What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data**  
We do not use customer data to profile our users.

**Still worried?**  
If you have any further questions or comments about the privacy policy, please [get in touch](page:86F53D6E-5325-4D54-9C2B-D1D3F8BEEBF6). We’re happy to answer any questions you have.
