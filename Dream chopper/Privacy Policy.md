**DO WE USE 'COOKIES'?**

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow it), that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction, so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

In addition, we use cookies to:

* Understand and save user's preferences for future visits;
* Keep track of advertisements; and
* Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions to offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to manage and modify your cookies.

If you disable cookies, certain features will be disabled. Disabling cookies will turn off features that make your site experience more efficient, and all our services will not function properly.

  

**THIRD-PARTY LINKS**

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on the Website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites or how they choose to share your PII, assuming you provide it to them. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

Reply “STOP”, to cancel text messages at any time, or by contacting us [here](https://dreamchopper.com/contact), to revoke consent to be contacted via auto-dialer, prerecorded message, or text message, at any time.

  

**CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT (CALOPPA)**

CalOPPA requires commercial websites and online services to post a ’conspicuous Privacy Policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this Policy. – See more [here](http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf).

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

* Users can visit our site anonymously.

**DOES OUR WEBSITE ALLOW THIRD-PARTY BEHAVIORAL TRACKING?**

Yes. It is also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking.

  

**CHILDREN ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT (COPPA)**

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under thirteen (13) years of age, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under thirteen (13) years of age.

  

**FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES PRINCIPLES**

The Fair Information Practices principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practices principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

To be in line with Fair Information Practices principles, we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

* We will notify the users via email, within seven (7) business days;
* We will notify the users via in-site notification, within seven (7) business days; and
* We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

**CAN-SPAM ACT**

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

We collect your email address to:

* Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions;
* Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders;
* Send you additional information related to your product and/or service; and
* Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.

To be accordance with the CAN-SPAM Act we agree to the following:

* To NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses;
* Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way;
* Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters;
* Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used;
* Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly; and
* Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can follow the instructions at the bottom of each email, and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
