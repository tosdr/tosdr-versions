In addition, the Company carries out periodical due diligence of business partners with which it has entered into long-term contracts (lasting longer than one year).

The due diligence procedure in respect of the business partners and Employees has the following goals:

* assessment of the impact of these connections on the legality of entering into the contract with the business partner from the point of view of Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws;
* assessment of commercial reasonableness and arm’s-length basis for a proposed transaction.

Any Anti-Corruption Compliance red flags raised during the course of the due diligence review must be addressed to the satisfaction of the local compliance manager before formally entering into, or continuing, the relationship.

#### 4.3. Gifts and hospitality expenses

The Company’s business decisions and those of its partners must be made objectively, without influence by gifts or favors. A small, reasonably priced gift or gesture of gratitude may sometimes be an appropriate way for business people to display respect for each other. Nevertheless, regardless of value, the giving or receipt of a gift, meal, entertainment, or other hospitality benefit must not be done with the intent to improperly influence a Government Official or any other party doing business with the Company.

3. must not affect the capability of the recipient to make impartial and fair decisions in connection with the official powers he or she has been entrusted with, nor must it impose any moral obligation on the recipient;
4. must not constitute hidden remuneration for the obtainment of improper commercial advantage, including any service, action, omission or decision, and likewise must not represent an attempt to exert influence on the recipient with another illegal or unethical goal;

Before the completion of any payment or donation of any gift in an amount exceeding (jointly during one-year period or separately) 100 USD to any third party, including to a Government Official, on behalf and/or at the expense of the Company, the Employee must contact the local compliance manager and provide detailed information about the proposed gift or other paid expenses in order to receive confirmation about the legality and admissibility of such payment or gift. Symbolic gifts, such as pens or calendars bearing the Company's logo, do not require the prior approval of the compliance manager.

The compliance managers shall be entitled to block transfer of the gift or payment of expenses if he or she establishes that such actions do not comply with the criteria set forth above, or create risks of violation of Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws for the Company.

Employees are entitled to accept small gifts and payment of hospitality expenses of modest value from third parties with which the Employees interact in the course of work for the Company, subject to the following conditions:

* the Employee believes in good faith that the giver has no intention of affecting in some way the performance by the Employee of his or her official duties.

Employees must not solicit or request gifts. Employees are obligated to inform the compliance manager if they receive any gifts or payment of expenses by third parties for an amount greater than 100 USD (or the quality of that sum in local currency).

#### 4.4. Retaining Government Officials

It may be justified to retain a current or former Government Official as an Employee or a business partner of the Company. However, doing so must be handled with caution. Such relationships must be structured so that they meet the requirements of the Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws and other applicable laws of relevant jurisdictions, and must not create a conflict of interest for the Government Official. No such relationship may be negotiated or agreed to without the prior approval of the compliance manager.

#### 4.5. Sponsorship and corporate social responsibility
