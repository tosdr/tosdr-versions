Terms of Use
------------

Last Modified on April 2, 2020
==============================

As noted in the policy below, the English language version of the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use will govern your relationship with YouVersion. While the English version will govern, you can also use an automatic translation tool like Google Translate to view the documents in your language. Any further translation revisions will be posted on this page.

* * *

### Acceptance of these Terms

By using YouVersion sites, services, and mobile applications (together, “YouVersion”), whether as a guest or a registered user, you accept and agree to bound by these Terms. Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use YouVersion, as well as the [YouVersion Privacy Policy](https://www.bible.com/privacy). If you do not agree to these Terms or the YouVersion Privacy Policy you must not access or use YouVersion.

### Changes to the Terms

YouVersion is offered by Life.Church Operations, LLC (“Life.Church”, “we” or “us”). We may revise and update these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. Any changes are effective when we post them. Your continued use of YouVersion following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes.

Where YouVersion has provided you with a translation other than the English language version of the Terms of Use, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language version of the Terms of Use will govern your relationship with YouVersion. If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms of Use says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.

### Changes to YouVersion

While we hope to always offer YouVersion and all of its features, we reserve the right to change or cease offering YouVersion or any part portion or functionality of YouVersion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of YouVersion is unavailable at any time.

### User Contributions

YouVersion contains interactive features that allow users to post, submit, publish, display, or transmit to other users or other persons content or materials (collectively, “User Contributions”) on or through YouVersion. However, we do not undertake to review User Contributions or any other material before it is posted on or through YouVersion, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. So, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party.

All User Contributions must comply with these Terms. By providing any User Contribution on or through YouVersion, you grant us and our service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns, the right to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, license, distribute, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such material in order to offer YouVersion. You represent and warrant that you own or control all rights in and to the User Contributions and have the right to grant this license and that all of your User Contributions do and will comply with these Terms. We are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Contributions posted by you or any other user of YouVersion.

### Account Security

YouVersion allows users to create an account (“Members”) which requires providing certain information to Life.Church. If you choose or are provided with a user name, password, or similar information as part of our security procedures, you agree to treat such information as confidential, and agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security. We have the right to disable any user name, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms.

### Monitoring and Enforcement; Legal Compliance; Termination

You agree that we have the right to:

* take any action with respect to any user, Member account, or User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion if we believe there to be a violation of these Terms, infringement of third party rights, a threat to the personal safety of others, or a threat, liability, or harm to the goodwill associated with YouVersion or Life.Church;
* take appropriate action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement and disclosure of your information, for any illegal or unauthorized use of YouVersion; and/or

Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any materials on or through YouVersion. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS LIFE.CHURCH AND ITS LICENSEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING OR AS A RESULT OF LEGAL INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER LIFE.CHURCH OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.
