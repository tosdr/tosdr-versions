Badgr Terms Of Service | Policy
===============================

**CANVAS BADGES TERMS OF SERVICE**

**_Last Updated:_** 10 February 2024

Instructure, Inc.’s (and its affiliate(s), collectively “**Instructure**”) Canvas Badges Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) cover and govern each individual user’s (referenced herein with “**you**”, “**your**”, or “**user(s)**”) use and access to the Canvas Badges service (“**Canvas Badges**”). 

​​**BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO USE CANVAS BADGES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS, AND TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE CANVAS BADGES POLICIES. PLEASE REVIEW THE APPLICABLE PRIVACY POLICIES** [**HERE**](https://www.instructure.com/policies/privacy-badgr)**. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OR DISAGREE WITH THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES, YOU SHOULD AND MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE CANVAS BADGES. PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.**

**1\.** **The Canvas Badges Service.**
--------------------------------------

**1.1 Description.** Canvas Badges is an online platform to create, curate, issue, receive, explore, and share digital badges and micro credentials (collectively “**Badges**”). Users of Canvas Badges can access tools to issue Badges to learners and other persons eligible to receive a Badge (each a “**Badge Recipient**”), as well as associated administrative tools and services. Badge Recipients can utilize Canvas Badges to receive, organize and display Badges. Canvas Badges also includes features that integrate with products and services offered by third parties to facilitate the micro-credentialing process and the sharing of Badges. 

**1.2** **Open Badges.**

**a.** Badges are based on the Open Badge Specification developed through the work of 1EdTech Consortium, Inc  (“**1EdTech**”) and its members. Instructure expects all users to respect the Open Badge Specification. Instructure plays no role in determining the value or veracity of a Badge and Instructure does not endorse or vouch for the qualifications of any Badge Recipient. The issuer of a Badge is solely responsible for determining the value and veracity of each Badge and the qualifications of each prospective Badge Recipient.

**b.** In 2020 1EdTech launched the Badge Connect™ API open standard, an initiative that was developed in partnership with its members. As a supporter of the Badge Connect standard, Instructure allows third parties to send Badges between Canvas Badges and third-party services on behalf of Badge Recipients. The third party accessing Canvas Badges for such purposes is solely responsible for obtaining the Badge Recipient’s consent in advance of accessing Canvas Badges for such purposes and for ensuring it shares the respective Badges only with third-party services the Badge Recipient has expressly authorized. 

**c.** When a Badge is issued to a Badge Recipient, pursuant to the Open Badge Specifications, Canvas Badges creates a publicly available web page for the Badge. This means the Badge and the associated Badge meta-data automatically becomes publicly available information upon issuance. In addition, once a Badge is issued, that Badge becomes sharable at the discretion of the Badge Recipient. Notwithstanding this change in status, an issuer of a Badge always has the ability to correct Badge information or delete a Badge.

**1.3** **Changes to Canvas Badges.** We reserve the right to modify or discontinue Canvas Badges (or any part or feature thereof) with or without notice. You acknowledge that Instructure may establish general practices and limits concerning use of Canvas Badges, including, without limitation, the maximum period of time that data or other content will be retained on our servers. Instructure shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of Canvas Badges.

**1.4** **Prohibited Uses.** Except for access to facilitate Badge sharing under the Badge Connect™ API open standard as described in Section 1.2.b. above or where you have otherwise received express permission from Instructure, you are at all times prohibited from accessing or otherwise using Canvas Badges: (a) to build a competitive product or service or (b) in conjunction with any other services that you sell or otherwise monetize. You are at all times prohibited from circumventing, or attempting to circumvent, any limitations that we impose on your account, User Content, or other services provided through Canvas Badges including without limitation the Canvas Badges APIs.

**2\.** **Account Management.**
-------------------------------

**2.1** **Registered Users.** Some Canvas Badges features are only available if you register a user account. Individuals who register an account (each a “**Registered User**”) have access to additional features and functions of Canvas Badges, for example, only Registered Users can create, curate, and issue Badges.

**2.2** **Account Owner.** The person registering for Canvas Badges is the owner of such Canvas Badges account (“**Account Owne**r”), provided that if you are registering for Canvas Badges on behalf of an organization, such organization shall be the Account Owner of the Business Account (“**Business Account Owner**”). If you are registering for Canvas Badges on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind such organization to these Terms and in such case “you” and “your” as used in these Terms refers to that organization. A “**Business Account**” is a Canvas Badges account created on behalf of and maintained by an organization and which is used for non-personal reasons (i.e., not used solely for receiving Badges). Examples of the types of organizations that might have a Business Account are, a corporation or other for-profit business entity, a public institution, such as a university or state agency, a public charity, or a private foundation.

**2.3** **Registered User Types.**

**a.** **Badge Recipient.** A Badge Recipient must become a Registered User before it can use Canvas Badges to share any Badges issued within Canvas Badges. To register, the following information is typically required: email address, first name, and surname.

**b.** **Business Account User Types.**

**(1)** **Administrator.** The Business Account Owner shall designate one or more administrators who shall have full access to, and administration rights over, all areas of the Canvas Badges available to the Business Account Owner (“**Administrator**”). The Business Account Owner may change the Administrators at any time through Canvas Badges. The Administrator must also be a Registered User.

**(2)** **Editors and Staff Members.** “Editors” are mid-level administrators who may create, edit, delete, and issue Badges. “Staff Members” are minimum-level administrators who can issue Badges that have been created by the Administrator or Editors. The Administrator may choose to designate one or more Editors and/or Staff Members. Editors and Staff Members must also be Registered Users.

**2.4** **Registration.** If you choose to register for a user account, you agree to provide and maintain accurate, complete, and current information about yourself as prompted by the registration form. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and account information and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. Registered Users agree to (a) immediately notify Instructure at [security@instructure.com](mailto:security@instructure.com) of any suspected or actual unauthorized use of their password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that they exit from their Registered User account at the end of each session when accessing Canvas Badges. Instructure will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from a Registered User’s failure to comply with this provision.

**2.5** **Third-Party Registration and Login.** We may offer you the ability to register an account using Facebook, Google, or other third-party services. If you choose to register via a third-party service or connect an account from a third-party service to your Canvas Badges account, Instructure may have access to certain information made available by you through such third-party service. Instructure does not control, is not responsible for, does not endorse, and fully disclaims any and all liability associated with your use of such third-party services. Third-party products and services are subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of such third-party providers.
