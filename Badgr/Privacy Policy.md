**Canvas Badges Website Privacy Policy**

_Effective Date 12/6/2022_

Canvas Badges is an online platform to create, curate, distribute, receive, explore, and share micro-credentials (“Badges”), and users can access tools to issue Badges to Badge Recipients, as well as associated administrative tools and services, such as Canvas Credentials.

Canvas Badges is provided by Instructure, Inc. (“Instructure,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) through our websites ([www.badgr.io](http://www.badgr.io/), [www.badgr.com](http://www.badgr.com/), and [www.badgr.org](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Credentials-Badges/ct-p/canvas-credentials-badges)), Canvas Credentials, and our APIs (collectively “the Site” or “Canvas Badges”). This Privacy Policy often refers to “you,” i.e., the Canvas Badges user. This Privacy Policy applies to information and data collected by Instructure as a controller, including information about Badge recipients, visitors to our website, and individuals who interact with us through other means, such as contacting us via telephone, email, or mail for information about our services. This policy explains what personal data we collect through Canvas Badges and Canvas Credentials as a controller, how we use and share that data, and your choices and rights concerning our personal data practices.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information and data Instructure processes in our capacity as a processer on behalf of organizations with a Business Account. Use of Canvas Badges or Canvas Credentials on behalf of an organization with a Business Account, for example as a badge issuer, is covered under the Canvas Badges Business Account Privacy Policy.

**6\. HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL DATA.**

We share your personal data with certain third parties in the following circumstances:

**6.1 Badge Tracking.** We use personal data for processing the award of Badges, such as tracking progress and completion. We may also share your personal data with respect to a given Badge with the Badge Issuer who created or awarded the Badge, and with other individuals designated by that Badge Issuer to assist with the creation and/or awarding of the Badge, and with the organization with which they are affiliated. For example, a Badge may be issued based upon your attendance at an event at a particular time and location. Your personal data, including location information from your device or the event’s organizer, may be used to confirm whether you meet the criteria for receipt of such a Badge.

**6.2 Badge Sharing by Third Parties.** As part of the Badge Connect™ open standard, Instructure may share your Badges with third parties. The third party accessing Canvas Badges for such purposes is solely responsible for obtaining your consent in advance of accessing Canvas Badges for such purposes and for ensuring it shares your Badges only with third-party services you have expressly authorized. If you have concerns or would like more information about the sharing of Badges under this subparagraph, you should contact the third party to whom you provided authorization or consent.

**6.3 Service Providers.** To assist us in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services it is sometimes necessary to share your personal data with third-party providers, such as providers of hosting, payment processing, email communication, and analytics. If required under applicable law, we will make a list of third-party service providers available to you upon request sent to [support@badgr.com](mailto:support@badgr.com).

**6.4 Business Transfers.** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or transition of a service to another provider, your personal data and other information may be transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction.

When we transfer information, we make use of the standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission.
