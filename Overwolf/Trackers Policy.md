What are Cookies?[​](#what-are-cookies "Direct link to What are Cookies?")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a user's browser, desktop client or device. The browser provides this piece of text to the device of the originating user when this visitor returns.

* A "session cookie" is temporary and will remain on your device until you leave the Services.
* A "persistent" cookie may be used to help save your settings and customizations across visits. It will remain on your device for much longer or until you delete it.
* First-party cookies are placed by us, while third-party cookies may be placed by a third party. We use both first- and third-party cookies.
* Information may also be collected through web beacons, which are small graphic images ("pixel tags"), which usually work together with cookies in order to identify users and user behavior. These may be shared with third parties.

We may use the terms "cookies" to refer to all technologies that we may use to store data in your browser or device or that collect information or help us identify you in the manner described above.

How We Use Cookies[​](#how-we-use-cookies "Direct link to How We Use Cookies")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use cookies and similar technologies for a number of reasons, for example, in order to (i) help personalize your experience by helping save your settings and customizations across visits and provide you with targeted content matching your interests, which we have identified based on your activity and viewing history on our Services and (ii) to help serve you ads relevant to your interests, which we have identified based on your activity and viewing history on our Services or your purchase history and usage of products and services you have previously purchased.

We use cookies and similar technologies to help personalize your experience and to personalize the ads we serve you. Third parties through which we provide the Services and/or our business partners may be placing and reading cookies on your browsers, as well as on our desktop client, or using web beacons to collect information in the course of advertising being served on different websites and on our desktop client. When visiting these Services, you shall be asked to accept the terms of this Privacy Notice, including the use of and placement of cookies and other similar technologies on your device as specified herein. For additional info about cookies and how to block them you may check this site [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies we use may change from time to time. However, the cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories:

| Type of Cookie | Why We Use These Cookies |
| --- | --- |
| **Necessary** | These cookies are necessary in order to allow the Services to work correctly. They enable you to access the Services, move around, and access different services, features, and tools. Examples include remembering previous actions (e.g. entered text) when navigating back to a page in the same session. These cookies cannot be disabled. |
| **Functionality** | These cookies remember your settings and preferences and the choices you make (such as language or regional preferences) in order to help us personalize your experience and offer you enhanced functionality and content. |
| **Security** | These cookies can help us identify and prevent security risks. They may be used to store your session information to prevent others from changing your password without your login information. |
| **Performance** | These cookies can help us collect information to help us understand how you use our Services, such as whether you have viewed messages or specific pages and how long you spent on each page. This helps us improve the performance of our Services. |
| **Analytics** | These cookies collect information regarding your activity on our Services to help us learn more about which features are popular with our users and how our Services can be improved. |
| **Advertising** | These cookies are placed in order to deliver content, including ads relevant and meaningful to you and your interests. They may also be used to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement. This can help us track how efficient advertising campaigns are, both for our own Services and for other websites. Such cookies may track your browsing habits and activity when visiting both our Services and those of third-parties. |

You are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. Please note that some features of the Services may function improperly when cookies are disabled or removed.

Overwolf's unique technology called "Cookie Sync" creates copies of the cookies that are available on your default browser and stores them on the Overwolf desktop client. These cookies are copied "as is", and are identical to the original cookies that are stored on your default browser; however they may change over time on the desktop client.

Overwolf uses "Cookie Sync" in order to properly operate the Products and Services, relay analytic information, improve the user experience and personalize ads that are displayed within the Services.

We assume you accept the use of these cookies, as you already gave your consent to using these cookies for targeted ads on your default browser.

Our Services have implemented Google Analytics Display Advertising features including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Using the Ads Settings, visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize [Google Display Network ads](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated). We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site. Our Services uses data aggregated from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as interests) for general reporting and improvement of our Services, and possibly for ad remarketing lists.

If you prefer generalised (non-personalised, non-targeted) ads, visit the links below to opt-out of cookies from major third party behavioral advertising providers (Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads).
