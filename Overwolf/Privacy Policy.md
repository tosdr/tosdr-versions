Other circumstances in which we will retain your Personal Data for longer periods of time include: (i) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements, or (ii) for us to have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or (iii) if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your Personal Data. Please note that except as required by applicable law, we will not be obligated to retain your data for any particular period, and we may delete it for any reason and at any time, without providing you with prior notice of our intention to do so.

**SECURITY MEASURES:**

We work hard to protect Personal Data we process from unauthorized access or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative security measures for the website that comply with applicable laws and industry such as: encryption using SSL, we minimize the amount of data that we store on our servers, restrict access to Personal Data to Overwolf employees, contractors and agents, etc. Note that, we cannot be held responsible for unauthorized or unintended access that is beyond our control, and we make no warranty, express, implied or otherwise, that we will always be able to prevent such access.

Please contact us at: [dpo@overwolf.com](mailto:dpo@overwolf.com) if you feel that your privacy was not dealt with properly, in a way that was in breach of our Privacy Policy or if you become aware of a third party's attempt to gain unauthorized access to any of your Personal Data. We will make a reasonable effort to notify you and the appropriate authorities (if required by applicable law) in the event that we discover a security incident related to your Personal Data.

### 8\. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER:

Our data servers in which we host and store the information are located in the US. Overwolf's HQ are based in Israel in which we may access the information stored on such servers or other systems such as Overwolf’s ERP, CRM and other systems. In the event that we need to transfer your Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection as required under applicable law. Furthermore, when Personal Data that is collected within the European Economic Area ("**EEA**") is transferred outside of the EEA to a country that has not received an adequacy decision from the European Commission, we will take necessary steps in order to ensure that sufficient safeguards are provided during the transferring of such Personal Data, in accordance with the provision of the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union. Thus, we will obtain contractual commitments and or assurances from the data importer to protect your Personal Data, using contractual protections that EEA and UK regulators have pre-approved to ensure your data is protected (known as standard contract clauses), or rely on adequacy decisions issued by the European Commission. Some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes.

### 9\. ELIGIBILITY AND CHILDREN PRIVACY:

This website is not intended for use by children (the phrase "child" shall mean an individual that is under the age defined by applicable law which with respect to the EEA is under the age of 16 and with respect to the US, under the age of 13) and we do not knowingly process children’s information. We will discard any information that we receive from a user that is considered a "child" immediately upon our discovery that such a user shared information with us. Please contact us at: [dpo@overwolf.com](mailto:dpo@overwolf.com) if you have reason to believe that a child has shared any information with us.
