CCleaner for Windows
--------------------

### Official Product Name

[CCleaner Free](https://www.ccleaner.com/), [CCleaner Professional](https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/professional), [CCleaner Business Edition](https://www.ccleaner.com/business/ccleaner-business-edition), [CCleaner Technician Edition](https://www.ccleaner.com/business/ccleaner-technician-edition) (collectively as “CCleaner for Windows”)

### Core Functionality

CCleaner for Windows is a safe and trusted PC utility that speeds up and cleans your PC, applies updates, securely wipes data and solves other computer problems.

### What are the Product’s Main Features

* **Custom Clean** cleans your browser history, cached images, cookies including both first-party and third-party cookies, and other junk with just one click, to keep your activity private and free up disk space.
* **Health Check** cleans your browser history, cached images, cookies including both first-party and third-party cookies, and other junk, to keep your activity private and free up disk space. Also conveniently updates third-party applications, and disables unnecessary startup items to reduce the time taken to start your PC.
* **Cloud Drive Cleaner** helps users manage their cloud storage (optimize, remove duplicates) by checking metadata associated with stored files and pictures. Files and pictures are not downloaded or stored by us. To connect to Google Drive, we need to ask Google for permission to use its APIs. Google allows companies to use its APIs only if they undertake to limit its use of information accessed through the APIs. As a result, Product’s use and transfer to any other product of information received from these Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.
* **Performance Optimizer** allows you to optimize your PC's performance by safely placing apps into 'sleep mode' so they do not use system resources after they have been closed down.
* **Driver Updater** provides an overview of your drivers and transmits authentic updates securely to your device to maintain the components that manage your sound, visuals, internet connection, and basic hardware like your mouse and keyboard.
* **Software Updater** conveniently updates third-party applications in a batch process.
* **Apps Uninstaller** permits uninstallation of all applications on the PC, including those that Windows typically won't allow you to.
* **Startup Manager** allows management of items that run at Windows startup.
* **Browser Plugin Manager** facilitates management of plugins from all browsers from a single interface.
* **Disk Analyzer** analyzes your disk internal and external drives to provide insights on disk usage by file type.
* **Drive Wiper** allows secure deletion of files on an internal or external drive, making original file content practically irretrievable.
* **Smart Clean** provides contextual triggers for cleaning and cleaning alerts allowing, for example, designated browsers to be cleaned every time they are closed.
* **Scheduled Cleaning** allows cleaning to be run automatically according to a specified frequency.

### Personal Data We Process

**When you use CCleaner for Windows to clean your PC** (Custom Clean, Health Check ‘Junk’ and ‘Privacy’ sections, Scheduled Cleaning, Smart Clean, Drive Wiper, Registry Cleaner, Disk Analyzer), the following data may be processed locally on your system depending on the feature used:

* Form data saved in your browsers such as name, surname, email, passwords;
* Cookies or data from websites that you visit;

* Records of what you downloaded from websites;
* Files on the device;
* Windows User profile names;
* Web domains belonging to cookies found on the device;
* User-defined web domain rules used for preventing cookie deletion;
* Entries in the Windows system Registry

This data is processed on your device and is not sent to our environment. Furthermore, CCleaner does not read the contents of files or databases because it does not need to. It just deletes the file or wipes all or part of a database.

**When you use CCleaner for Windows to manage applications and services on your PC** (Health Check ‘Speed’ section, Uninstaller, Startup Manager, Browser Plugin Manager), the following data may be processed locally on your system depending on the feature used:

* Installed browsers and browser plugins;
* Installed applications;

This data is processed on your device and is not sent to our environment.

For example one can automatically decrease screen brightness when at home.

Kamo
====

Official product name
---------------------

[Kamo](http://www.ccleaner.com/kamo)

Core Functionality
------------------

As you browse the web, profiles of your behavior are compiled and linked to you via cookies and fingerprint-based tracking technologies. This data can be then shared and sold by analytics and ad-tech firms. Certain activities you engage in are also collected by the Windows operating system. Kamo removes cookies and masks the device’s “fingerprint” to prevent third-parties from identifying you and following your behavior across the web, and turns off the various settings that allow data collection in the Windows operating system.

What are Product’s Features
---------------------------

* **Anti-Fingerprinting** stops scripts from fingerprinting the user’s device and tracking their browsing behavior across the web.
* **Privacy Score** provides the user with an evaluation of how private they are based on various in-app configurations.
* **Clears your browser history and cookies** helps the user manage their browsing history and cookies by allowing them to manually clear them or schedule automatic clearing at their discretion.
* **Windows System Privacy** collates the 90+ Windows operating system settings that impact the user’s privacy, and makes them controllable with just a handful of switches in one place.
* **VPN feature** allows to protect your privacy by hiding your location and encrypting your online communication. It allows you to pick a specific location to be connected from.

Personal Data We Process
------------------------

**When disguising your browser fingerprint**, Kamo may process the following data locally on your system:

* Browsers you have installed (if Chrome, Edge, Internet Explorer, Opera, or Firefox) and their versions;
* Any extensions you have installed;
* Your hardware data;
* OS version of your device; and
* Any scripts running in your browser from third-party websites.

Kamo uses this information in order to detect tracking attempts and to generate fake, substitute data to fool fingerprinting attempts (for example, by changing your screen resolution data or your browser’s version). Kamo does not record this data, nor does it send it back to our environment. It uses it locally and on the spot.

**When cleaning your browsing**, Kamo may process the following data locally on your system:

* Form data saved in your browsers such as name, surname, email, passwords;
* Cookies or data from websites that you visit;
* Records of what you downloaded from websites;
* Web domains belonging to cookies found on the device;
* Browsing history; and
* User-defined web domain rules used for preventing cookie deletion.

This data is processed on your device and is not sent to our environment. Furthermore, Kamo does not read the contents of your browser’s data because it does not need to. It just deletes the file or wipes all or part of a database.

**When locking down Windows for privacy**, Kamo may process the following data locally on your system:

* What version of Windows 10 you are running;
* Status of 90+ settings in Windows 10 which have an impact on your privacy; and
* Any changes to the Windows settings in question triggered by a Windows update.

This data is processed on your device. Kamo does not record this data, nor does it send it back to our environment.

**When generating a privacy score**, Kamo may process the following data locally on your system:

* What Kamo settings you have enabled;
* The number of installed browsers for whom you have enabled Kamo’s protection; and
* A score based on the above data points.

This data is processed on your device. Kamo does not record this data, nor does it send it back to our environment.
