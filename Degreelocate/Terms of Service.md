For any matters not subject to mandatory arbitration, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Maricopa County, AZ for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. All claims filed or brought contrary to this section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim improperly, we may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, provided that we have notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim and you have failed to withdraw the claim promptly.
