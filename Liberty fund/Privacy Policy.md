The data storage period may vary with scenario, product, or service.

**_Your Rights and Choices_**

The CCPA and CPRA provide consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes CCPA/CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.

_Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights_

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:

* The categories of personal information we collected about you.
* The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
* The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
* The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
* If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, a list of the disclosures made identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.

_Correct/Rectify Personal Information_

You have the right to rectify (correct, update, or modify) the personal information we collect about you. After making such a request, we will take commercially reasonable efforts to correct inaccurate personal information within 45 days of receiving the request. In the event an extension is needed, we may take an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary. In this case, we will provide you a notice of extension within the first 45-day period.

_Deletion Request Rights_

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records unless an exception applies.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:

* Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
* Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
* Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
* Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights or exercise another right provided for by law.
* Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
* Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, specifically if you previously provided informed consent and deleting that information may seriously impair or render impossible the research’s achievement.
* Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
* Comply with a legal obligation.
* Make other internal and lawful uses of personal information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

_Exercising Access, Rectification, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights_

To exercise the limitation, access, rectification, data portability and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by:

Emailing us at [info@libertyfund.org](mailto:info@libertyfund.org).

Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

_Response Timing and Format_

We will try our best to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another and should allow you to further transmit information if you desire.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive or unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

_Non-Discrimination_

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA/CPRA rights. Based solely on the exercise of your CCPA/CPRA rights, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services

**Individuals in the European Economic Area**

Under the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), individuals in the European Economic Area have additional privacy rights:

* **Right to Be Informed**. Individuals have the right to transparency regarding our collection of personal data.
* **Right of Access.** Individuals have the right to know exactly what information is held about them and how it is processed.
* **Right of Rectification**. Individuals will be entitled to have personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
* **Right to Erasure**. Also known as the “right to be forgotten,” this refers to an individual’s right to having their personal data deleted or removed without the need for a specific reason as to why they wish to discontinue.
* **Right to Restrict Processing**. An individual’s right to block or suppress processing of their personal data.
* **Right to Data Portability**. This allows individuals to retain and reuse their personal data for their own purpose.
* **Right to Object**. In certain circumstances, individuals are entitled to object to their personal data being used.
* **Rights regarding Automated Decision-Making and Profiling.** The GDPR has put in place safeguards to protect individuals against the risk that a potentially damaging decision is made without human intervention.

To exercise the above rights, please contact us at the information provided below. We will consider and process your request within a reasonable period of time. Please be aware, under certain circumstances, the GDPR will limit your exercise of these rights.

**Accessing and Correcting Your Information**

You have the right to request personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. Users can request a copy of this information by sending an email to [info@libertyfund.org](mailto:info@libertyfund.org).

If you request we delete your User Contributions from the Site, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other website users.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this Site. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account or through a website notice on the Site home page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page.
