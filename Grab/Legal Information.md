Privacy Notice
==============

Effective Date: 25 **October 2024**

This Privacy Notice and its Addendum(s) (“**Privacy Notice**”) describe how Grab Holdings Limited, its respective subsidiaries, affiliates, associated companies and jointly controlled entities (collectively “**Grab**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”) collect, use, process and disclose your Personal Data through the use of Grab’s mobile applications and websites (respectively “**Apps**” and “**Websites**”), as well as products, features and other services globally, operated by Grab (collectively, “**Services**”).  

This Notice applies to our consumers, agents, vendors, suppliers, partners (such as driver, delivery and merchant partners), contractors and service providers (collectively “**you**”, “**your**” or “**yours**”).

“**Personal Data**” is any information which can be used to identify you or from which you are identifiable. This includes but is not limited to your name, nationality, telephone number, bank and credit card details, personal interests, email address, your image, government-issued identification numbers, biometric data, race, date of birth, marital status, religion, health information, vehicle and insurance information, employment information and financial information.

We typically collect, use, disclose or otherwise process your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Notice with your consent, or in compliance with applicable laws, such as where:

* it is required for us to comply with legal requirements;
* it is required for us to enter into or perform a contract with you; and/or
* for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of any other persons, including but not limited to for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Notice.

For example, if you are a user, we may verify your identity through selfie images as an additional layer of protection, or in accordance with Grab’s Know Your Customer procedure as required by applicable financial regulations. If you are a driver-partner, you may be asked to authenticate your identity via selfie before or after rides to prevent unauthorized usage of your driver account; and

        * our partners are also contractually obliged to safeguard this data.

Once your Personal Data is no longer necessary for the Services or Purposes, or we no longer have a legal or business purpose for retaining your Personal Data, we take steps to erase, destroy, anonymise or prevent access or use of such Personal Data for any purpose other than compliance with this Notice, or for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention and detection, in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws. 

**V. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA**
-----------------------------------------------

Your Personal Data may be transferred from the country, state and city (“**Home Country**”) in which you are present while using our Services to another country, state and city (“**Alternate Country**”).

When we transfer your Personal Data from your Home Country to the Alternate Country, we will comply with our legal and regulatory obligations in relation to your Personal Data, including having a lawful basis for transferring Personal Data and putting appropriate safeguards in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for the Personal Data. We will also ensure that the recipient in Alternate Country is obliged to protect your Personal Data at a standard of protection comparable to the protection under applicable laws.

Our lawful basis will be either consent (i.e. we may ask for your consent to transfer your Personal Data from your Home Country to the Alternate Country at the time you provide your Personal Data) or one of the safeguards permissible by laws.

**VI. COOKIES, RELATED TECHNOLOGIES AND ADVERTISING ON THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cookies

Grab, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5, advertising identifiers and similar technologies (such as software development kits (SDKs), which have similar functions to cookies and which may be installed in the Grab App to allow partners to collect certain information about your interaction with the Grab App) (collectively, “**Cookies**”) in connection with your use of the Websites and Apps, which may be persistent or stored only during an individual session on your browsers or devices. 

Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may be used for various purposes such as to:

* provide the essential, basic functions of the use of our Websites, Services or Apps;
* authenticate you, or remember your user preferences and settings;
* delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, such as by measuring number of views or clickthroughs;
* analyse site traffic and trends; 
* serve you relevant advertisements across other apps and websites owned by other companies (whether by us or by other advertisers); and
* enhance user interface and experience by generally understanding the online behaviors and interests of users who interact with our Website, Services or Apps.

Grab may allow third parties to use Cookies on the Websites and Apps to collect the same type of Personal Data for the same purposes Grab does for itself. Third parties may be able to associate the Personal Data they collect with other Personal Data they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use.

### Disabling the collection of cookies on our websites 

You have the right to choose to disable, block or deactivate cookies. Please note that however refusal or removal of some cookies could affect the availability, functionality or use of our Website, Services or Apps.

You may adjust your internet browser settings to disable, block or deactivate cookies, delete your browsing history or clear the cache from your internet browser. The settings may be contained within the “History”, “Preferences”, “Settings” or “Privacy” section of your internet browsers, or you may otherwise consult the help section of your internet browser for more information. You may also adjust your cookie settings here:

### Disabling the display of Targeted Ads on other platforms  

We may facilitate the display of targeted advertising on other platforms, such as on other online platforms that you may be a user of. 

You may be able to limit our use of your Personal Data to display targeted advertisements on behalf of our advertisers, by adjusting your preference through our Grab App. Depending on the type of phone and operating software that you are using, you may be granted the option to disable our use of mobile identifiers (such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s GAID) and the ability to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies by adjusting the settings available on your mobile devices. Through adjusting the settings on your device, you can typically reset, delete, limit and/or otherwise restrict the use of such mobile identifiers.

Although we will not use your Personal Data to show you such targeted advertisements on other platforms, you may still see generic ads that appear relevant to you. This may be because we have engaged third party advertisers / platforms to display ads to users of specific attributes or demographic makeups who may find them relevant. You may be able to limit seeing these advertisements through managing your preferences on these platforms.

**VII. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA**
------------------------------------

We will take reasonable legal, physical, organisational and technical measures to ensure that your Personal Data is protected. This includes measures to prevent Personal Data from getting lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We limit access to your Personal Data to our employees on a need to know basis. Those processing your Personal Data will only do so in an authorised manner and are required to treat your information with confidentiality.

Nevertheless, please understand that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted through any online means, therefore, any transmission remains at your own risk.

**VIII. YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA**    
------------------------------------------------------------

In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, you may be entitled to:

* inquire about the processing of your Personal Data and be provided with a copy of it;

* complain to the relevant data privacy authority if your data privacy rights are violated, or if you have suffered detriment as a result of unlawful processing of your Personal Data.

If you are given the option to share your Personal Data with us and you choose not to, or subsequently withdraw your consent for our use of it,  this could mean that we are unable to perform the actions necessary to achieve the purposes of processing described in _Section II (Use of Personal Data)_ or that you are unable to make use of App or the Services in such circumstances. We may be able to continue to process your Personal Data to the extent required or otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations.

**ADDENDUM 1: GRAB FOR BUSINESS**
---------------------------------

**I. INTERPRETATION**
---------------------

All capitalised terms but undefined terms used herein shall bear the same meaning as those defined in the Terms of Use and Grab’s Privacy Notice

This Addendum forms part of the Grab Privacy Notice. In the event of any inconsistency between the Grab Privacy Notice and this Addendum, this Addendum shall prevail.

**II. GRAB’S RELATIONSHIP WITH USERS AND CLIENTS**
--------------------------------------------------

### How Grab for Business works

Grab for Business is provided as an add-on feature for organisations (“Client”) to facilitate corporate billing for itsAuthorised Users’ (e.g. employees) use of Grab’s Services in the course of work.

When a Client chooses to utilise Grab for Business, the Authorised User is given the option of tagging his/her rides or other transactions to the Client or to tag it as a personal ride. As part of this feature, Grab will disclose detailed trip and booking information that Authorised Users have tagged as being for business purposes to the Client. Apart from this, Grab does not disclose other Personal Data of Authorised Users to the Client.

Alternatively, an individual user may choose to set up a business profile within the App to facilitate the tagging of business-related rides and to generate consolidated trip reports to facilitate the submission of claims from his or her employer. When used in this mode, the claims process is user-driven and the user’s employer need not be a Client.

For ease of reference, Authorised Users and individual users will each be referred to as a “User” and collectively as “**Users**” in this Addendum.

### Grab is a data controller, so are our Clients

In respect of any User and the processing of their Personal Data , **Grab acts as a data controller**. For further information on how Grab collects, uses and discloses Users’ Personal Data, please refer to the Grab Privacy Notice.

Due to the way Grab for Business works, Grab does not process any Personal Data for and on behalf of the Client. Accordingly, **Grab is not the data processor of the Client**, but **an independent data controller** in respect of all Personal Data that it processes in the course of providing the Grab for Business feature. Likewise, the Client is an independent data controller of the Personal Datathat it discloses to and/or receives from Grab.

As independent controllers, Grab and the Client individually determine the purposes and means of processing Personal Data, subject to the provisions set out in the Terms of Use and this Privacy Notice. Grab and the Client are also individually responsible to ensure the protection of Personal Data under their charge.

**III. WHAT PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED, PROCESSED AND DISCLOSED**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### What Grab collects as part of Grab for Business

In order to provide the Grab for Business feature, the User or the Client will be required to provide the following information about the User to Grab:

* full name;
* business email address; and
* other identifying information about the User as reasonably requested by Grab.

Grab will use this information for the purposes of:

* authenticating the User;
* where applicable, linking the Authorised User’s account with the Client’s Grab for Business account or tracking the Authorised User’s business profile bookings on the Apps, as the case may be;
* where applicable, verifying the Corporate Billing status of such Authorised User from time to time; and
* contacting the User in accordance with the purposes set out in the Grab Privacy Notice .

Upon onboarding aUser to the App, Grab will process the Personal Data of the User in accordance with the Grab Privacy Notice and this Addendum.

### What Grab discloses to its Clients

Grab will disclose relevant trip and booking information as determined by Grab from time to time to the Client to facilitate Corporate Billing.

### What Grab discloses to its individual user

Depending on the business profile settings selected by the individual user, the user may retrieve and generate reports containing his/her relevant trip and booking information.

**IV. PARTIES’ OBLIGATIONS**
----------------------------

The Client and Grab shall each:

Komsan Chiyadis
---------------

GrabFood delivery-partner, Thailand

COVID-19 has dealt an unprecedented blow to the tourism industry, affecting the livelihoods of millions of workers. One of them was Komsan, an assistant chef in a luxury hotel based in the Srinakarin area.

As the number of tourists at the hotel plunged, he decided to sign up as a GrabFood delivery-partner to earn an alternative income. Soon after, the hotel ceased operations.

Komsan has viewed this change through an optimistic lens, calling it the perfect opportunity for him to embark on a fresh journey after his previous job. Aside from GrabFood deliveries, he now also picks up GrabExpress jobs. It can get tiring, having to shuttle between different locations, but Komsan finds it exciting. And mostly, he’s glad to get his income back on track.
