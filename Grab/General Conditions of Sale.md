**10\. Data Sources**

Grab uses open source libraries within Grab mobile applications as set out in http://grb.to/oss-attributions.

**11\. GrabUnlimited**

This section applies to GrabUnlimited subscription and benefits. You agree to these terms and conditions by maintaining a GrabUnlimited subscription and/or using the benefits.

Users who subscribe to GrabUnlimited will receive benefits such as vouchers monthly, depending on the applicable  subscription  plan. Vouchers will be available in the ‘My Rewards’ page in the Application. Unless otherwise stated, vouchers must be used in Singapore by the stated expiry date, if any. Vouchers can only be redeemed when making purchases in the Application with your GrabPay Wallet, eligible credit or debit card, or through PayLater. 

Grab may vary the type, value, amount and redemption terms and conditions of the benefits as shown in the Application at any time.  

Fees and Renewals

The GrabUnlimited subscription fee is stated in the Application. Grab may vary the subscription term and fees from time to time. GrabUnlimited Subscription fees are non-refundable. 

If you subscribed for GrabUnlimited directly with Grab through the Application and are billed by Grab, the subscription fee will be deducted from your selected payment method on each billing date. **Take note that your GrabUnlimited subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel it via the Application before the billing date.** If your selected payment method is unavailable, we will automatically deduct the amount from another linked card you have on the Application or your GrabPay wallet. If the deduction or charge is unsuccessful, your subscription will be cancelled.

If you received a GrabUnlimited subscription from a third party, that subscription will terminate unless renewed by the third party. You may be required to pay a nominal fee to activate the subscription. You may receive a GrabUnlimited subscription from a third party even if you have already subscribed for GrabUnlimited yourself.

Grab may offer certain users trial or promotional GrabUnlimited subscriptions, which are subject to these terms and conditions unless otherwise stated in the promotion offer. Trial subscribers may choose not to continue with a fully paid GrabUnlimited subscription at the end of the trial period.

Business purchases

This section applies to purchases of GrabUnlimited subscriptions by businesses registered in Singapore. If you are a Grab for Business client or are using the Grab for Business portal, these terms and conditions apply in addition to the Grab for Business terms and conditions.

You may submit an order for GrabUnlimited subscription plans through the channels notified by Grab (“**GrabUnlimited Order**”). Grab will invoice you following your GrabUnlimited Order. You must make payment in accordance with the payment instructions and deadline stated in the invoice.

All GrabUnlimited Orders are final and cannot be cancelled by you. You are responsible for ensuring that the Order details are accurate, and where your recipients’ personal data (e.g. email address, phone number) is provided, you warrant that you have obtained their consent to do so for the issuance of GrabUnlimited subscriptions to them.

You must redeem the GrabUnlimited subscriptions within the redemption period stated in GrabUnlimited Order. GrabUnlimited subscriptions which have been activated by users cannot be withdrawn.

Termination

Grab may terminate the GrabUnlimited subscription plans at our discretion without notice. If that happens, Grab will refund the subscription fees on a pro-rated basis. However, Grab will not provide any refund for termination to conduct which we determine, at our discretion, violates these terms and conditions or any applicable law, involves fraud or misuse of the GrabUnlimited subscription, or is harmful to Grab or other users.

Komsan Chiyadis
---------------

GrabFood delivery-partner, Thailand

COVID-19 has dealt an unprecedented blow to the tourism industry, affecting the livelihoods of millions of workers. One of them was Komsan, an assistant chef in a luxury hotel based in the Srinakarin area.

As the number of tourists at the hotel plunged, he decided to sign up as a GrabFood delivery-partner to earn an alternative income. Soon after, the hotel ceased operations.

Komsan has viewed this change through an optimistic lens, calling it the perfect opportunity for him to embark on a fresh journey after his previous job. Aside from GrabFood deliveries, he now also picks up GrabExpress jobs. It can get tiring, having to shuttle between different locations, but Komsan finds it exciting. And mostly, he’s glad to get his income back on track.
