**8\. GrabAds Terms**

8.1 Terms in this section are applicable to you (advertisers) who wish to use GrabAds services to promote your business within the Grab Application. If you agree to use this service, you are responsible for complying with all applicable laws, regulations and codes that apply to your ads and local regulations where your ads appear. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account for any violation in accordance with these GrabAds Terms.

**Content Specifications**

8.2 Your ads must:

1. Be suitable for access by the general public; 
2. Accurately reflect the content of the landing page;
3. Be clear and accurate towards the Consumers;
4. Only promote products/services that you either own or are authorized to resell or distribute; 
5. Not violate any applicable laws and regulations; and 
6. Comply with the Guideline on inappropriate and sensitive online content: GrabAds and GrabFood (“[**Guideline**](https://www.grab.com/sg/terms-policies/guideline-on-inappropriate-and-sensitive-online-content-grabads-and-grabfood/)”).

8.3 The Content Specifications apply to any and all ads which you make available through the GrabAds services. The Content Specifications must be complied with in spirit as well as to the letter, and apply to each part of any ad as well as to its whole.

**Promo Messages** 

8.4 The use of promotional messaging must comply with the following requirements:

* We prohibit the use of superlatives such as “Huge Savings” or “Gigantic Discounts”.
* The start and end dates of your ad campaign must reflect the duration of the offer or the saving period so that ads do not run on dates when the offer or the savings do not apply.
* Campaigns must be scheduled to end on the last day of the promotion.
* Campaign dates for a specific holiday or seasonal event (for example, Ramadan, Valentine’s Day or Christmas) must start within a reasonable time frame leading up to the event and must end within 24 hours after the event date, or a reasonable time after that depending on the event.
* If you extend the campaign after the offer or the saving period ends, you must modify your ad copy by removing the promotional messaging that no longer applies.

**Keywords Utilization**

8.5 Keywords are words or phrases that are used to match your ads with the terms people are searching for. Selecting high quality, relevant keywords for your advertising campaign can help you reach the customers you want, when you want.

8.6 When a Consumer searches for a term that matches your keyword, your ad enters an auction to determine if it will show. While Grab uses reasonable efforts to capture all possible variations and misspellings of a keyword you choose, Grab does not guarantee that all possible variations of a keyword are captured. 

8.7 The cost for each keyword will be different depending on the keyword you choose, your competition in the auction, and other factors. Make sure your keywords and landing page are all closely related to the terms that a customer might be searching for, and will not cause confusion, deception or mistake as to the source or origin of your goods/services.

8.8 Higher quality ads and relevance to user searches typically lead to lower costs and better ad positions.

8.9 In the event that you choose to use the keyword search feature available on the Platform, and you select the ‘automatic’ keyword search strategy feature, you acknowledge and agree that Grab has the sole and absolute discretion to select and optimise keywords on your behalf. If you do not want Grab to select and optimise keywords on your behalf, please select the ‘manual’ keyword search strategy feature instead.

**Representations and warranties**

8.10 You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your ads content, campaign details and targeting decisions. This includes without limitation your choice of keywords as well as territorial scope and target audience of the pertinent campaign and ads. You shall indemnify us in the event where we incur any losses or damages pursuant to the same.

8.11 Without prejudice to the generality of the other provisions of these Terms, you further represent and warrant that your ads as well as any related content do not infringe any third party rights including without limitation trademark rights. If Grab receives any complaint in respect of your ads content, campaign details and targeting decisions or otherwise deem that they or any part thereof are not compliant with the Content Specifications, we reserve the right to remove the same, suspend our services to you, and/or require that you modify the affected material. We may, but are not obliged to, review the ads as well as the related content or information submitted or amended by you from time to time.

Komsan Chiyadis
---------------

GrabFood delivery-partner, Thailand

COVID-19 has dealt an unprecedented blow to the tourism industry, affecting the livelihoods of millions of workers. One of them was Komsan, an assistant chef in a luxury hotel based in the Srinakarin area.

As the number of tourists at the hotel plunged, he decided to sign up as a GrabFood delivery-partner to earn an alternative income. Soon after, the hotel ceased operations.

Komsan has viewed this change through an optimistic lens, calling it the perfect opportunity for him to embark on a fresh journey after his previous job. Aside from GrabFood deliveries, he now also picks up GrabExpress jobs. It can get tiring, having to shuttle between different locations, but Komsan finds it exciting. And mostly, he’s glad to get his income back on track.
