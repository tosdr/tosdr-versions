Terms of Service: Payment and Rewards
=====================================

Last modified: 6 March 2024

**Important** – please read these terms carefully. By using the Service (as defined below), you agree that you have read, understood, accepted and agreed with the Terms of Service. You further agree to the representations made by yourself below. If you do not agree to or fall within the Terms of Service and wish to discontinue using the Service, please do not continue using the Application (as defined below) or the Service.

The Terms of Service stated herein (collectively, the “Terms of Use” or this “Agreement”) constitute a legal agreement between you (the “User”) and **GPAY NETWORK (S) PTE. LTD.** (the “Company”).

By using the Grab mobile application supplied to you by the Company’s affiliated company/ies (the “Application”), and downloading, installing or using any associated software supplied by the Company (“the Software”) which overall purpose is to enable persons seeking to establish an account with the Company and use the GrabPay Wallet (the “GrabPay Wallet” and generally, the “Service”), you hereby expressly acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, and any future amendments and additions to these Terms of Use as published from time to time at [https://www.grab.com/sg/](https://www.grab.com/sg/) or through the Application, and your continued use of the Service after any such changes, whether or not reviewed by you, shall constitute your consent and acceptance of the revised Terms of Use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will provide ten (10) business days’ notice of any changes, which the Company in its reasonable discretion deems material, to these Terms of Use following which your continued use of the Service will be deemed to confirm your acceptance of such changes.

Consumer advisory – Consumers (Users) are advised to read the terms and conditions (i.e. these Terms of Use) carefully. The Company holds a Major Payment Institution Licence (Licence No. PS20200167) issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) in respect of cross-border money transfer, e-money issuance, account issuance, merchant acquisition and domestic money transfer services.

**1\. Use of the GrabPay Wallet**

* Type of payments that can be made with the GrabPay Wallet:  
    The GrabPay Wallet may be used for the sale and purchase of goods and services from all transportation providers, merchants and agents lawfully offering GrabPay as a payment solution (either by way of static/dynamic QR Code payment, settlement via the Application, or online settlement), PROVIDED HOWEVER that no payments in violation of the provisions of these Terms of Use, including the Acceptable Use Policy (below) shall be permitted.
* Applicable Fees and Charges: There shall be no charges levied by the Company on usage of the GrabPay Wallet other than as agreed with you in writing.
* User Transaction Statement:  
    A full statement of User’s transactions may be downloaded from the following website: [https://www.grab.com/sg/](https://www.grab.com/sg/)
* Fraudulent activity or stolen e-money:  
    You agree to immediately notify the Company by visiting our Help Centre: [http://help.grab.com](https://help.grab.com/) or reach us at +65 6902 1036 of any fraudulent activity or theft of funds in the GrabPay Wallet of which you become aware.
* The Company has the right to suspend, or later reverse, the processing of any transaction where it suspects that that the transaction may be fraudulent, illegal or involves any criminal activity or where the Company reasonably believes you to be in breach of the Terms of Use.
* The Company reserves the right to suspend the use of your account entirely, disable the cashless feature in the GrabPay Wallet or block any financial instruments e.g credit or debit card where it suspects that there is, or could reasonably be or result in, any fraudulent, illegal, and/or unlawful act, criminal activity, or breach of these Terms of Use.
* Unless the context dictates otherwise, references in these Terms of Use to the GrabPay Wallet, shall include all such stored value facility e-wallets issued to Users by the Company to include the GrabPay Consumer Wallet, the GrabPay Driver Wallet and the GrabPay Merchant Wallet.

2. **Use of the Service**

* Payments by the GrabPay service may be made directly in the Grab application via the addition of a credit or debit card, PayNow QR / VPA or via such other method of making payment to merchants as is available in the Application, or by the use of the GrabPay Wallet.
* Users may choose to add any credit or debit cards, PayNow QR / VPA, or such other methods of loading funds into the GrabPay Wallet as are made available in the Application (each, together with those payments in the first bullet point a “Funding Source”).
* You agree that we may verify and authorize the Funding Source details when you first register the Funding Source with us as well as when you use the Service.
* In the case of debit or credit cards as Funding Sources, you agree that we may issue a reasonable authorization hold, which is not an actual charge against your card, in order to verify your payment method via your card. The hold may appear in your statement as “pending”. The authorization hold is issued as a preventive measure against any unauthorized or fraudulent usage of your card.
* In the event your payment through the GrabPay Wallet using a debit or credit card as your Funding Source is processed overseas, you will be liable for any additional charges in relation thereto.
* If you choose to use a foreign payment method, such as a foreign debit or credit card or foreign wallet payment, a foreign payment fee may be applied to cover the additional costs associated with processing international payments. Transactions involving foreign cards may also be subject to currency conversion. The conversion rate applied will be determined solely by the Company or its payment processing partners and may include a margin for currency exchange services. The Company reserves the right to modify foreign payment fees, including, without limitation, to introduce or remove at its discretion other fees associated with the Services, at any time.
* Your GrabPay Wallet will hold Singapore Dollars together with those foreign currencies as are from time to time made available to Users.
* In the event your payment through the GrabPay Wallet is made to an overseas merchant offering goods or services in a currency other than Singapore Dollars (either by way of QR Code payment or online settlement):
    * Payment will first be drawn from those multi-currency pockets which match the advertised currency of settlement of the merchant for such goods or services; and
    * In the event that no such currency as matches the currency of settlement of the merchant is held by the User in their GrabPay Wallet, payments will be made:
        * Where the overseas merchant is a GrabPay merchant capable of accepting such payments, by way of the application of a dynamic exchange rate for payments settled directly to the overseas GrabPay merchant; and
        * Where the overseas merchant is not a GrabPay merchant capable of accepting such payment, by way of payment by GrabPay Card in accordance with Section 21 of these Terms of Use (where such method is available).
* When you make or receive a payment, you are liable to the Company for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason including but not limited to claims, chargebacks, or if there is a reversal of the payment. You agree to allow the Company to determine (or in the case where a debit or credit card is used as the Funding Source, to work with your debit or credit card issuer) to determine the appropriate party to incur the burden of such claims, chargebacks or reversals and where applicable to recover any amounts due to the Company by debiting your GrabPay Wallet. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is an error in relation to a transfer or an entry is incorrect, we reserve the right to submit corrected entries.
* You agree that the Company may at any time set off any of your liability to the Company and/or its affiliates against any liability of the Company and/or its affiliates to you, whether either liability is present or future, liquidated or unliquidated, and whether or not either liability arises under these Terms of Use. This includes setting off any amount payable by you to the Company and/or its affiliates against any amounts to be paid to you by the Company and/or its affiliates under these Terms of Use or otherwise. Notwithstanding any other provision, the Company and/or its affiliates may also deduct any sums in your GrabPay Wallet to satisfy any outstanding amounts or payments due to the Company and/or its affiliates. Any exercise by the Company of its rights under this Section shall not limit or affect any other rights or remedies available to it under these Terms of Use or otherwise. 
* Your GrabPay registration also allows Users to make direct Debit Card and Credit Card payments to selected merchants.
* You shall be responsible to resolve any disputes with your debit or credit card company, or your bank in relation to payments or top-ups of your GrabPay Wallet on your own. The Company shall not be responsible for any such lost or misdirected payments.
* You may choose to top-up your GrabPay Wallet automatically by activating the “Auto Top-Up” option via the Application. By activating “Auto Top-Up”, you authorise us to transfer into your GrabPay Wallet a specified amount that you have selected via the Application by deducting from or charging to your Funding Source, should the balance in your GrabPay Wallet fall below a designated amount. To withdraw such standing instruction, you may deactivate “Auto Top-Up”. You hereby authorise us to perform such transfer from the Funding Source in accordance with instructions via the Application. Such authorisations and standing instructions will remain effective and unchanged unless you have requested to deactivate or cancel the “Auto Top-Up” in accordance with such method as we may prescribe and such request has been accepted by us. For the avoidance of doubt, such cancellation shall only be effective after we have confirmed acceptance of cancellation of the Auto Top-Up function via the Application and any transfers prior to such confirmation shall proceed unaffected. Your instructions in relation to such prior transfers are irrevocable.  
* Where you have activated “Auto Top-Up”, you understand and agree that you shall, at all times, maintain sufficient funds available in your Funding Source(s). Failing to do so may lead to a failure in the “Auto Top-Up” resulting in failed payment transactions and/or delays, among other consequences. You understand and agree that we will not be responsible or liable in any way for any such consequences of any nature whatsoever and you agree not to take any action or to release us from any claims whatsoever in relation to any such consequences.
* You may choose to top-up your GrabPay Wallet by choosing the “Digital Payment Token” option and converting your selected digital payment tokens (DPT) to fiat currency (Singapore Dollars). By choosing the “Digital Payment Token” option, you agree and acknowledge that the conversion will be processed by Triple A Technologies Pte Ltd, a DPT service provider in Singapore licensed by the MAS (“Triple A”). Triple A will provide the wallet address and the conversion rate for the transfer and conversion of your selected DPT on your selected blockchain network into Singapore Dollars.  By proceeding, you acknowledge and agree that you will be subjected to Triple A’s own terms of service and privacy policy, and we are not responsible for any transactions, activities, content, views or terms and policies of Triple A. You agree to hold us harmless from any liability or damages arising from your interaction or use of Triple A’s service or any transaction conducted by Triple A. You also agree and understand that the “Digital Payment Token” top-up option is subject to potential downtime, network errors or technical issues beyond our control. While we strive to provide a seamless experience, we cannot always guarantee uninterrupted access to Triple A or the availability of their services. You understand that any delays, interruptions, or errors in the transaction process by Triple A are beyond our responsibility and may impact the completion or accuracy of your transaction, among other consequences.
* In the case of conversion of DPT as Funding Source, you agree to choose only the DPT and the blockchain network that are available in and are set out in the Application. You are responsible to input the **correct wallet address** generated within the Application to your blockchain wallet in order to transfer your selected DPT into fiat currency. Failure to do any of the above may lead to a failure in the top-up, resulting in a failed transaction and/or delay, or permanent loss of the DPT, among other consequences. We are not liable for any delays, losses, or damages arising from any such consequences of any nature whatsoever and you agree not to take any action or to release us from any claims whatsoever in relation to any such consequences. If applicable, you may be liable for additional fees or charges associated with the conversion of the applicable DPT. 
* Notwithstanding any other provisions, the “Auto Top-Up” feature is not available for top-up via “Digital Payment Token” option.  
* The top-up via conversion of DPT transaction is subject to the Company and/or Triple A’s rights and discretion to either refuse to complete, reject, block or cancel the transaction, and/or suspend, restrict or terminate the availability of this top-up method, including but not limited to, where:
    * the Company and/or Triple A is required to do so by applicable law, regulations or any court or regulatory authority;
    * the top-up fiat amount exceeds or causes you to exceed your GrabPay Wallet limits;
    * you have failed the Company and/or Triple A’s internal regulatory, security, or risk assessments; or
    * the Company and/or Triple A reasonably believe or suspect you of acting in breach of these Terms of Use or Triple A’s terms and conditions, or reasonably believe or suspect that the transaction is being used in a fraudulent or unauthorized manner or is associated with any illegal activity or transaction.
* Except as set out herein, you agree and acknowledge that **successful** top-up via “Digital Payment Token” option is **final**, **non-reversible**, and **non-refundable**. However, you may be entitled to a refund if your top-up via “Digital Payment Token” option is rejected or canceled. You will be required to provide a blockchain wallet address in order to receive your refund. The refund amount will be based on the original fiat top-up amount, converted into your originally selected DPT based on the latest rate provided by Triple A. If applicable, you will be liable for any additional fee or charge in relation thereto. You understand that the refund will be provided by Triple A and you agree that we shall not be liable for any claims, loss, or damages arising from or in connection with the refund by Triple A.

RISK WARNING ON DIGITAL PAYMENT TOKEN SERVICES 

Pursuant to the Payment Services Act 2019 and MAS Notice PSN08 Notice to licensees and exempt payment service providers issued by MAS – MAS requires the Company, as a partner of Triple A, to provide this risk warning to you as a customer of Triple A (a digital payment token (DPT) service provider). Before you pay or transfer to your DPT service provider any money or DPT, you should be aware of the following:

1. Your DPT service provider is licensed by MAS to provide DPT services. Please note that this does not mean you will be able to recover all the money or DPTs you paid or transferred to your DPT service provider if your DPT service provider’s business fails. 
2. You should not transact in the DPT if you are not familiar with this DPT. This includes how the DPT is created, and how the DPT you intend to transact is transferred or held by your DPT service provider. 
3. You should be aware that the value of DPTs may fluctuate greatly. You should buy or transact in DPTs only if you are prepared to accept the risk of losing all of the money you put into such tokens. 
4. You should be aware that your DPT service provider, as part of its licence to provide DPT services, may offer services related to DPTs which are promoted as having a stable value, commonly known as “stablecoin”. 

**3\. GrabPay Credits**

* You may purchase and hold credits for the GrabPay Wallet (“GrabPay Credits”) via a Funding Source in Singapore Dollars or such other foreign currencies that are offered.
* Other than for those GrabPay Driver Wallet and GrabPay Merchant Wallet Users notified in writing to the contrary, the maximum amount of GrabPay Credits that a User of the GrabPay Wallet can hold at any time is S$5,000 (or such equivalent aggregate amount in foreign currencies), or such lesser limit as is notified to you under the Application) and the total value of consumer payment transactions using the GrabPay Wallet in a calendar year may not exceed S$30,000 (or such equivalent aggregate amount in foreign currencies).
* You may transfer GrabPay Credits funds between currency pockets held in your GrabPay Wallet at the applicable daily exchange rate, which rate shall be notified to you immediately prior to completing the transaction.
* If you purchase GrabPay Credits via any Funding Source, you are deemed to have agreed to the terms of service of the Company’s processing partners and your financial institution. You will bear all fees that may be charged by such processing partners and/or your financial institution (if any) for the payment method you have selected.
* The Company may at its sole and absolute discretion reject your request to purchase GrabPay Credits or reject a payment transaction, or refund a payment or other transaction, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, where your proposed GrabPay Credits purchase:
    * would cause the aggregate amount of stored value held by the Company, directly or indirectly, alone or together with any person over whom the Company has control or influence, to exceed any value permitted under the prevailing laws and regulations; or
    * would cause the amount of GrabPay Credits held by you (or in the case of transfers of GrabPay Credits, the recipient of the transfer) to exceed the respective maximum amount for the GrabPay Wallet detailed above or any other regulatory or risk limit prescribed for that GrabPay Wallet.
* All GrabPay Credits will only be valid for one (1) year from the date of your last purchase or spend, whichever the later. The expiry date set out in the Application shall serve as conclusive evidence of the expiry date of your GrabPay Credits. The Company shall have the right to deal with the expired GrabPay Credits in such manner as it deems fit in its absolute discretion including such GrabPay Credits being forfeited.
* You will not receive interest or other earnings on your GrabPay Credits. The Company may receive interest on amounts that the Company holds on your behalf. You agree to assign your rights to the Company for any interest derived from your GrabPay Credits.
* You may check your GrabPay Credits balance in the Application. The GrabPay Credits balance set out in the Application shall serve as a conclusive evidence of your GrabPay Credits balance.
* As GrabPay Wallet purchases may involve credit card transactions through a financial institution, in the event of any error in such transaction which results in chargebacks from the financial institution, the Company reserves the right to clawback the amount (up to the disputed amount) from your GrabPay Credits or by any other way it deems fit in its sole discretion.
* The Company has the right to forfeit your GrabPay Credits where it reasonably believes that your use of the Service may be fraudulent, illegal or involves any criminal activity or where the Company reasonably believes you to be in breach of the Terms of Use.

**4\. Withdrawal and Transfer of GrabPay Credits**

* The GrabPay Credits for the GrabPay Wallet cannot be resold or transferred for value. The GrabPay Credits shall not be regarded, construed, or used as valuable or exchangeable instruments under any circumstances.
* You may transfer GrabPay Credits to, and receive GrabPay Credits from, other GrabPay Wallet Users. 
* Save for any Non-Transferable Balance (as defined below), you may transfer GrabPay Credits to, and receive GrabPay Credits from, accounts held locally with the following banks and e-wallets which are part of the FAST and PayNow bank transfer network in Singapore:

Komsan Chiyadis

GrabFood delivery-partner, Thailand

COVID-19 has dealt an unprecedented blow to the tourism industry, affecting the livelihoods of millions of workers. One of them was Komsan, an assistant chef in a luxury hotel based in the Srinakarin area.

As the number of tourists at the hotel plunged, he decided to sign up as a GrabFood delivery-partner to earn an alternative income. Soon after, the hotel ceased operations.

Komsan has viewed this change through an optimistic lens, calling it the perfect opportunity for him to embark on a fresh journey after his previous job. Aside from GrabFood deliveries, he now also picks up GrabExpress jobs. It can get tiring, having to shuttle between different locations, but Komsan finds it exciting. And mostly, he’s glad to get his income back on track.
