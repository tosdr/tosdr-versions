Changes to the Terms of Use
===========================

We reserve the right to modify the Terms at any time, but you will be notified on Co:Writer Universal’s login page or by some other means. We will not change the Terms in any material way without providing notice of the change via email to you (in the case of a Child User, to the Parent or Guardian; and in the case of a Student User, to the Educator User), and obtaining consent to any new uses. If you do not agree with the new terms, you may reject them, but you will need to terminate your account and/or stop using Co:Writer Universal.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.

You may not transfer your account to anyone without express prior written consent of Don Johnston Incorporated. An account can be created for and accessed by a single individual only. You may not share an account with anyone without express prior written consent of Don Johnston Incorporated. Violation of any of the foregoing may result in immediate termination of your account, revocation of your ability to use Co:Writer Universal, and may subject you to reimburse us for unauthorized accounts, pay for past use, state and federal penalties, and other legal consequences.

If you are a Child User, you may not create an account. You must either use a Child Account created through a Parent Account or a Student Account created through an Educator Account.

We do not collect personally identifiable information on Child Accounts. Collected information for Student Accounts are solely used for educational purposes by Educator(s) and Educational Institution(s).

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a Child User except in the following circumstance: We may collect personal information through Co:Writer Universal from a Child User where that Child User’s Educational Institution and/or Educator has agreed to 1) obtain parental or legal guardian consent or 2) consent on the parent or guardian’s behalf for that Child User to use Co:Writer Universal with a Student Account and disclose personal information solely for educational use.

If you are an Educational Institution or Educator, you represent and warrant that you are responsible for complying with The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”). If we learn we have collected personal information from a Child User other than pursuant to the above, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

Parent User

If you are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal parent or guardian of a child, you may register a Parent Account. As a Parent User, you may create, register, and manage Child User accounts only for your own child or children for whom you are a legal guardian. If you register a Child User, you represent and warrant that you are such Child User’s legal parent or guardian and you agree to be bound by the Terms on Behalf of such Child User.

Educator User

If you are at least 18 years of age and you provide education to students, you may register an Educator Account.

You represent and warrant that you will use all information collected by Co:Writer Universal solely to provide education-related services. You represent and warrant that you are responsible for complying with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) and The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”).

------------------------------------------

For information about Co:Writer Universal’s policies and practices regarding the collection and use of personal information, please read Co:Writer Universal’s [Privacy Policy](https://cowriter.com/privacy-policy/cowriter).

Subscriptions and Billing
=========================

Educator and Parent Users with Credit Card
------------------------------------------

### Purchasing

After your free trial, you will not be charged unless you decide to purchase a subscription for Co:Writer Universal. You pay only for the Student or Child Accounts you have set up.

Once purchased, you will be charged immediately for your first month of your subscription (often called pre-billing). You will be billed automatically every month until the subscription is canceled.

### Adding More Students/Children

You may want to purchase the product for more students/children. We will automatically prorate the additional charges. You will not be charged immediately for the additional students/children: those charges will be reflected on the next invoice. Again, the plan changes impact the next invoice, which remains on the same billing cycle (as your plan will always have the same billing frequency). The prorated amount is calculated down to the second. We will calculate the differences between the two plans based on the exact time you added/removed students/children and their relation to the current billing period's start and end times.

### Removing Students/Children

If you decide to remove students/children from your plan, you will receive a prorated credit, which will be reflected on the next invoice. The prorated credit is calculated down to the second. We will calculate the differences between the two plans based on the exact time you added/removed students/children and their relation to the current billing period's start and end times.

### Canceling All Subscriptions

When you cancel all subscriptions, your card will not be charged again. Cancellation takes effect immediately. If your subscription was canceled partway through the billing period, you will not be credited a refund.

### Failed Payments

If a payment fails, we will automatically retry. If it fails repeatedly, your subscription will be canceled.

### Invoice Timing

An invoice is created at the end of the subscription's billing cycle.

### Processing of Payments

We use Stripe, a third party electronic payment processor to process credit card transactions for payment of Co:Writer Universal. You irrevocably authorize us to instruct Stripe to handle such transactions, and you irrevocably agree that we may give instructions on your behalf in accordance with your requests submitted within Co:Writer Universal. You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of Stripe, and in the event or conflict between these Terms and Stripe’s Terms, these Terms shall prevail.
