### Contributor License Agreement

All contributions, both on the site and on our GitHub repository, are subject to our[CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla),to which you should agree before contributing.

### Client-Side Code - MIT

All client-side code for codecombat.com in the public GitHub repository and in the codecombat.com database, is licensed under the[MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).This includes all code in Systems and Components that are made available by CodeCombat for the purpose of creating levels.

### Art/Music - Creative Commons

All common content is available under the[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Common content is anything made generally available by CodeCombat for the purpose of creating Levels. This includes:

* Music
* Sound
* Artwork
* Sprites
* Any and all other non-code creative works that are made available when creating Levels.

Currently there is no universal, easy system for fetching these assets. In general, fetch them from the URLs as used by the site, contact us for assistance, or help us in extending the site to make these assets more easily accessible.

For attribution, please name and link to codecombat.com near where the source is used or where appropriate for the medium. For example:

* If used in a movie or another game, include codecombat.com in the credits.
* If used on a website, include a link near the usage, for example underneath an image, or in a general attributions page where you might also mention other Creative Commons works and open source software being used on the site. Something that's already clearly referencing CodeCombat, such as a blog post mentioning CodeCombat, does not need some separate attribution.

If the content being used is created not by CodeCombat but instead by a user of codecombat.com, attribute them instead, and follow attribution directions provided in that resource's description if there are any.

### Rights Reserved

All rights are reserved for Levels themselves. This includes

* Scripts
* Unit configuration
* Description
* Writings
* Media (sounds, music) and any other creative content made specifically for that Level and not made generally available when creating Levels.

To clarify, anything that is made available in the Level Editor for the purpose of making levels is under CC, whereas the content created with the Level Editor or uploaded in the course of creation of Levels is not.

### In a Nutshell

Any resources we provide in the Level Editor are free to use as you like for creating Levels. But we reserve the right to restrict distribution of the Levels themselves (that are created on codecombat.com) so that they may be charged for.
