2.1 Except as expressly provided herein, the Software is intended to be used only by individuals and entities that can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Persons using the Software and our Network (defined below) to purchase products or services or utilizing resources on behalf of an employer must do so only with the authorization of their employer.

In addition, the Software enables You to share Postings (as hereinafter defined) that may be made available to the public and the Software enables You to share information with others that You authorize. Access to CRI's Network is by means of the user's computer which runs the Software, or accesses the Software through a CRI Network server, and is connected to a telecommunications network allowing access to CRI's Network. The communication protocols used by the Software are those currently used by the Internet network. The rights of access to and use of CRI's Network are non-exclusive and non-transferable. While continuous access to the Internet and to CRI's Network is not required for You to use the Software (e.g., portions of the Software may be used offline), Your access to, and certain functionality of, the Software will automatically be shut down if You have not accessed the Network for a period of thirty (30) days until such time as You do access the Network (at which time Your access to the Software will be automatically restored). No automatic shut down or restriction of the Software pursuant to this Section will result in the termination of this EULA or any of the terms and conditions herein. To the extent that You use certain Site Features (defined below) through the Network, You will be subject to any additional guidelines, restrictions or rules applicable to such access, including, without limitation, any technical specifications that CRI may provide from time to time and CRI's Terms of Use ("Website Terms") and Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy"), which are available at http://www.thebluebook.com or such other URL as CRI may provide from time to time (the "Site"). 2.3 CRI uses the means that it believes is reasonable to provide access to its Network through the Software 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except in the case of natural disasters or events beyond the control of CRI and subject to any breakdowns or any maintenance operations required to ensure the smooth operation of its website service and equipment. CRI will not be liable for any failure or deficiency in the performance of its Network by reason of the occurrence of any event beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation, a labor disturbance, an Internet outage, interruption of service, communication outage, failure by a service provider to CRI, fire, terrorism, natural disaster or war.

8.1 The Software and Documentation are protected by United States patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property laws and international treaty provisions. All right, title and interest in and to all copyrights, patents, trade secret rights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights in and to the Software (including, without limitation, any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and "applets" incorporated into the Software) and the Documentation (collectively, "Software Information"), are owned by or licensed to CRI and/or its suppliers, and the structure, organization and code relating to the Software or otherwise made available through Your use of the Software and all other information or data supplied by CRI and/or its suppliers, products, free listings or website users and customers, including, without limitation, any and all information and data in machine readable form (collectively, "Data Information" and together with the Software Information, the "Proprietary Information"), are proprietary, confidential, and are the valuable trade secrets of CRI and/or its suppliers. You acknowledge, and agree not to challenge in any manner, that the Proprietary Information is, in part: (i) comprised of collections and assemblies of preexisting data, the selection, organization and arrangement of which results in original works, (ii) incorporates and/or integrates data that is not preexisting but instead is the original expression of CRI or its suppliers, as the case may be, and (iii) derives value from the fact that such data was promptly selected, organized, arranged and published by CRI or its suppliers. You acknowledge that Your possession, installation, or use of the Software and/or the Proprietary Information does not transfer to You any ownership, title, or registrable interest of any kind in or to the intellectual property in the Software or Proprietary Information, and that You will not acquire any rights in or to the Software or Proprietary Information except as expressly set forth in this EULA. CRI's suppliers, if any, of the Software or Documentation, or any portions thereof, are intended third party beneficiaries of this EULA and are entitled to enforce the terms of this EULA in their own names directly against You. 8.2 Trademarks, service marks, trade names, product names, logos, designs, titles, and words or phrases used on the Site, including, without limitation, the marks, "THEBLUEBOOK.COM®," "CONTRACTORS REGISTER®," "VU360®," "SYNCWARE®," "THE BLUE BOOK®," "MY BLUE BOOK®," "BPM SELECT®," "BID SCOPE®," "BB-SUPPLY®," "THE BLUE BOOK BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION®," "THE BLUE BOOK BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION NETWORK®, "AEC SOLUTIONS®" "BB-GATEWAY®", "BLUEBOOKUNIVERSITY.COM®", "BB BID®," "PROJECT SOURCE™", "JOBSITEEQUIP.COM™", "BLUE BOOK UNIVERSITY™", "THE BLUE BOOK UNIVERSITY™", "PROJECT PIPELINE®", GET-BIDS™, PROVIEW® and related design marks are owned by CRI, its licensors or other entities. Trademarks shall be used in accordance with accepted trademark practice, including identification of the trademark owner's name.

Such use of any trademark does not give You any rights of ownership in that trademark. 8.3 You agree that during the term of this EULA and for a period of one year thereafter, to the extent commercially reasonable under the circumstances, You will cooperate in the enforcement of all rights in and to the Software and Proprietary Information against infringers. Any failure by You to so enforce such rights, within a reasonable time after notification, that results in unauthorized copying or use of the Software or Proprietary Information by any third party, will, despite any other provision of this EULA and without limiting any legal or equitable rights CRI may have, entitle CRI to terminate this EULA. 8.4 As between You and CRI, CRI obtains no ownership interest in any of Your data, information or material owned, licensed or otherwise lawfully obtained by You ("Data") that You submit or store through Your use of the Software.

##### 9\. PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT SECURITY

9.1 The Software may allow You to create Your own online account by completing a registration process. In doing so, You must provide CRI with accurate and complete registration information, and update it if Your information changes. It is particularly important to keep the e-mail address associated with Your account current because although You may be able to log into Your account using an old e-mail address, You will not be able to receive messages from CRI about Your Postings or other matters. If You provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, incomplete or not current, or CRI has grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, incomplete or not current, CRI has the right to suspend or terminate any issued password and refuse any and all current or future use of the Software and Site Features. 9.2 Following Your registration, CRI will create an account for You and assign You, or allow You to select, a password.

You must notify CRI immediately if You believe Your password may be used by any unauthorized person or entity. CRI may authenticate Your password periodically.
