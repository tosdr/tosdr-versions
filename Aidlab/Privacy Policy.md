Last modified: November 1st, 2023

Aidlab, a brand operated under Aidmed Sp. z o.o. (“Aidmed”), is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit the Aidlab website (“Visitors”) and individuals associated with organizations who register to use the Products as defined below (“Customers”). This Privacy Policy (the “Statement”) describes Aidlab's privacy practices in relation to the use of the Aidlab website (www.aidlab.com), other Aidlab websites made available from time to time, and applications and services offered by Aidlab (collectively, the “Products”) as logged-in users, mobile app users (“Users”), and individuals using Products without logging in (“Visitors”). The privacy policy pertaining specifically to products directly associated with Aidmed ("Aidmed Cloud", "Aidmed One", "Aidmed Health") can be found at www.aidmed.ai.

Guiding Principles for Data Processing

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online, as well as to address the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for our users in the European Union. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. GDPR expands this definition to include data that could indirectly identify a person. GDPR also provides additional rights to EU residents, including the right to access, correct, and request deletion of their personal data. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information and personal data in accordance with our website.

In processing Users' and Visitors' data, we are guided by the following principles:

* Legality, fairness and transparency for the individuals subject to data processing.
* We do not collect more information than we need to provide the services performed by Aidlab.
* We do not use data for purposes other than those mentioned in this Privacy Policy.
* We do not keep data longer than necessary.
* We process data in a way that ensures adequate security, including protection against unlawful or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.
* We do not disclose data to third parties other than as set out in this Privacy Policy.

Who we are

What personal information do we collect from the people who visit our websites, use our devices, or interact with our apps?

When ordering or registering on our site, app, or device, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, phone number, or other details to facilitate your experience. At this stage, some basic medical data may also be requested to provide you with a personalized service.

* Medical Data Collection from Our Devices

In addition to the information you provide, our devices are designed to collect a range of health and wellness data to give you a comprehensive understanding of your health status. This includes, but is not limited to, Electrocardiogram (EKG) readings, chest movement, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), motion data (including data from the accelerometer), skin temperature, and more. This data allows us to provide personalized feedback and insights into your health and wellness. Please note that all data collected is strictly used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

* Sound

While Aidlab version 2.2 and higher includes a built-in microphone, it's important to understand its functionalities. The microphone is capable of recording raw sound and is turned on by default. However, we only gather basic sound features such as sound volume level (in dB) and other sound characteristics that enable us to automatically detect specific sounds like coughing or snoring. Please be assured that the collected sound data cannot be used to reconstruct or recover human speech. If in the future we decide to implement any features that would involve more detailed sound data collection, we will provide advance notice.

* Location Information

To enable full experience when user records their acivities with Aidlab, the application asks for background location permissions. The agreement is optional and can be turned off at any time in the phone and app settings. Background location is used to record and show walks, runs and bike rides on a map, even when screen is turned off or application is in the background.

* Connectivity Data

In order to ensure proper communication and interaction between your device and our products, we collect data related to Bluetooth connections. This data is necessary for enabling discovery services and making our devices detectable. It's important to note that these permissions will be requested, and you have the option to grant or deny them.

* Logs

We collect and maintain logs of various activities within our application and devices. This includes data such as device failures, battery status, activity in our applications, and exercise completion.

We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:

* Users can visit our site anonymously.
* Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
* Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.

You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:

* On our Privacy Policy Page.
* You can change your personal information by logging in to your account.

How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?

We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.

Does our site and apps allow third-party behavioral tracking?

Yes.

COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

We do not let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13.

Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

* We will notify users via email, within 1 business day
* We will notify users via in-site notification, within 1 business day

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

How long do we keep your personal data

The personal data of which Aidlab is the controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) GDPR will be processed for the duration of the contract for the provision of services or to lodge an effective objection to the processing in cases where the legal basis for the processing is the legitimate interest of Aidlab. The period of data processing may be extended where the processing is necessary for the establishment and assertion of potential claims or defense against claims, and thereafter only if and to the extent required by law.
