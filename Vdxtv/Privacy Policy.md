Introduction
------------

Exponential Interactive, Inc. doing business as [vdx.tv](http://vdx.tv/) (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is an advertising media services company whose clients and customers are online advertisers (“Advertisers”) and digital content providers (collectively, our “Partners”). We help our Partners reach their target audiences and grow through ad sales.  Learn more about us at [vdx.tv](http://vdx.tv/).

### Terminology

This policy uses the following terms:

* Personal information is used in the same way as the California Consumer Privacy Act defines it, which is essentially the same as GDPR's "personal data". This includes IP address, cookie ID and device ID.
* Personally Identifiable Information - information such as name, email address, phone number.
* Sensitive Information, or Sensitive Personal Information, also known as Special Category Data - information linking an individual to a precise geolocation, or a health condition, or ethnicity or religious categories.
* Legal basis - in EU and some other jurisdictions, legal basis must be ascertained before processing data. For the purposes of this policy, we include two legal bases:some text
    * Consent - the user concerned, i.e. you, have provided consent to us directly or via one of our partners
    * Legitimate interest - as a company, we have identified it is justified to process the data and doing so does not conflict with your rights, nor is it unexpected or unreasonabel for us to do so.

### Purpose

This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of personal information, and of the rights of consumers regarding their own personal information (collectively, “your information”) when you visit this website ([vdx.tv](http://vdx.tv/)), in relation to the services we provide our Partners, and any other means in which you interact with us, directly or indirectly.

We may collect certain information when you visit websites or digital settings that include our online technology.  Such information includes:
