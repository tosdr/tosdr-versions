SECURITY
========

**WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

We use servers in the United States to process and store **Personal Data**. In the future we may use servers located elsewhere. In that event, we will update this Privacy Policy and will promptly inform **Clients** of the update through a notice appearing when a **Client** logs into their subscription.

While no server can be completely secure, we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these servers are kept in a secure, locked environment with restricted access and we have on our own, and in conjunction with the third parties who operate the servers, established physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect **Personal Data.**

**Personal Data** stored by us may be accessed and processed by staff operating outside your jurisdiction, who work either for us or for one of our **Business Partners.** This staff may be engaged in fulfilling your order or request, processing a payment, storing information, and/or providing support services to us. We require these **Business Partners** to agree to treat your **Personal Data** securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

We have implemented a variety of technical and organizational measures to protect **Personal Data** from loss, misuse, unlawful processing, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, alteration, and destruction. These include limiting access to the databases to a limited number of authorized staff who are required to maintain the information as confidential. Further, access to the databases is password protected. We also have in place audit logs, intrusion detection software, anti-virus or malware protection, and system integrity tools to further protect data stored on these databases.

HACKERS
=======

While we make reasonable and industry-standard efforts to ensure the integrity and security of our network, **Products,** and systems, we cannot guarantee that such security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining information.

We cannot be, and are not, responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained in our **Products,** including the illegal acts of third parties (such as criminal hacking).

We disclaim any and all liability for disclosure of any information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties as more specifically detailed in our Disclaimers. **ANY TRANSMISSION OF DATA THROUGH OUR PRODUCTS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

THIRD PARTY WEBSITES & COMMUNICATIONS
=====================================

Our **Products** (including our **Sites**) may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of third parties. We only link to the home page of third-party content.

**Clients** may use our **Products** to communicate with other subscribers, to create a ‘tribe’ within our **Products,** and to may make contact with, and/or engage, coaches. As with any social media or engagement, we urge you to exercise caution. There is no substitute for good judgment. As examples only: Do not meet anyone in any private, secluded location.

CLIENTS

When you stop subscribing to our **Products,** we will retain your **Personal Data** for a reasonable period of time in order to allow you to download any database information, if any, stored therein.
