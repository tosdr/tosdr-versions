Terms of Use
============

Thank you for using the-qrcode-generator.com! These terms of service (Terms) cover your use and access of our website, our Chrome Extension and related software (our Services).

These Services are provided by Uniqode Phygital Inc., 12 East 49th Street, New York, NY 10017 (we, our, or us).

By using our Services you agree these Terms and to review our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms or our Privacy Policy, you should not use our Services.

Software

Our Services may include web-based or downloadable software, which may update automatically on your device to newer versions. We grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive and non-transferable to use the software solely to use the Services. Components of the software may be offered under an open source license, in this case we will make that license available to you. Provisions of the open source license may expressly override some of these Terms.

Changes to Services

We may change the features of our Services, withdraw or add new features form time to time.

Pricing

Static QR Codes are free. Static QR Codes are free and completely stand-alone, without any reference or dependency on our Service. That's because they encode any content directly, just like regular printed text. So technically they are completely independent from us, once created.

Dynamic QR Codes are tied to your account. Dynamic QR Codes encode a link to our Service which serves the actual content. That allows you to update the content of a Dynamic QR Code at a later point in time and see scan statistics. We do not limit the number of scans of your Dynamic QR Codes. With the free plan, people scanning your Dynamic QR Codes do see our branding for a few seconds before being shown the actual content. This can be removed by upgrading if needed.

Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extend permitted by law, in no event shall we be liable for any damages or loss of data, business, profits, computer hardware or software. In no event shall our liability to you exceed the greater than 60 USD or the amounts paid by you to us for the past 12 months.

Warranties

We strive to provide good Services and hope you enjoy using them. But there are things we cannot guarantee. We provide our Services 'As is'. To the fullest extend permitted by law, we make no warranties either implied or expressed about the Services. We do not make any promise about the specific functions of the services, their reliability or availability.

Changes to Terms

We reserve the right these Terms at any time. We will always post the most current version on our website. By continuing to use the Services after the changes become effective, you agree to the revised Terms.
