Privacy Policy
==============

Updated September 1, 2020

#### Definitions

To make this document easier to read, we’re going to use some shorthand throughout. For example, when we say “ChOP” or “the Platform” we’re talking about the web-based online ministry application tool described and accessible at [https://churchonlineplatform.com](https://online.church/). The Platform is part of a suite of software products and services owned and operated by Life Covenant Church, Inc., which we’ll refer to as “Life.Church,” “us,” or “we” throughout this policy. The Platform is intended for use by non-profit institutions, and use of the Platform requires registration by an account administrator. We call those non-profit institutions as well as their administrators and other registered account users “Members.” Unregistered internet users that are merely browsing Platform sites are called “Visitors”. When we refer to both in this policy, we’ll use the term “you.” In using the Platform, Members are able to create websites that have their own respective users which Members may collect information directly or through third party apps. We call these Member websites “Your Websites” and the users of “Your Websites” we call “Your Users.”

#### Accepting the Terms

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it discusses if and how we will collect, use, share, and process your personal information. By accessing the Platform you agree to this Privacy Policy and its terms and consent to having your data transferred to and processed in the United States. Your use of the Platform is also governed by our [Terms of Use](https://online.church/terms). Please read those terms carefully as well. We welcome any questions or comments you may have about this Privacy Policy and our privacy practices. If you have any questions or comments, you may contact us at: Life Covenant Church, Inc., attn.: Church Online Platform Support, 4600 E. 2nd St., Edmond, Oklahoma 73034 or [info@online.church](mailto:info@online.church).

#### How We Use Your Information

#### Information We Collect and How We Collect It

Information You Provide to Us

Visitors do not need to submit personal information. to view the websites that describe our Platform. You do not have to become a Platform Member to view Your Website or another website created by another Member using the Platform.

You do need to become a Member and create a Platform account to create and administer Your Websites via the Platform. To become a Member, you are required to create an account and provide certain information such as your administrator's name and email address, your business name and website URL, and the state or country in which you are located. This information is collected, stored and used by Life.Church to facilitate your use of the Platform, maintain the security of Your Websites, prevent unauthorized administration of Your Websites, and for our other legitimate business purposes.

Beyond this required information, you have choices about whether to provide additional information to be associated with your Member account. We collect personal data from you when you provide, post, or upload it to the Platform. You do not have to provide such information; however, if you do not, it may limit our ability to personalize or fully support the Platform and your ability to use the Platform to its fullest extent.

Information You Collect from Your Users

You also have choices about what information you collect, use, share, and otherwise process about or from Your Users. We facilitate this collection, use, and sharing based on the choices you make to facilitate your use of the Platform. Your Websites may operate without Your Users’ personal information; however, use of Your Users’ information allows you to personalize Your Websites and use the Platform to its fullest extent.

Based upon the choices you make, Your Users will have options as to what information they provide through Your Websites. For example, the Platform will allow you to provide Your Users the option to link Your Websites on the Platform with other websites, applications, and services or profiles Your Users may have with third party applications. If you allow this option and Your Users choose to link with these third party applications and services, Your Users will provide you and us the personal data stored on those applications to the Platform and Life.Church. For example, Your User may create an account on Your Website by linking their Facebook account to the Platform, providing personal information they have opted to share through Facebook to you and Life.Church through the Platform. Your Users may revoke a link with such accounts and third party applications by modifying their settings with those applications. As another example, the Platform will allow you to provide Your Users the option to provide their device information and telephone number for communications about events and services. If you allow this option and Your Users provide such information to you on Your Website, it will be stored and used by Life.Church to facilitate the communications you opt to allow.

The Platform will allow you to provide Your Users the option to link to or interact with third party websites, applications, or services with which Your Users have no prior relationship.

You are responsible for any data collected, stored, or used based on those interactions, and you are responsible for your own relationship with those third parties and their subsequent data, privacy, and communication practices with Your Users.

You decide what information you seek and collect about Your Users through the Platform and Your Websites. Accordingly, as between you and Life.Church, **it is your sole responsibility to ensure that you have a legal basis for the collection, use, dissemination and other processing of Your Users’ information.**

Sensitive Data

We do not require that you or Your Users provide sensitive data such as religious denomination, race, ethnicity, philosophical beliefs, or physical or mental health to create or maintain a Platform account or to use Your Websites. It is your choice whether to provide such sensitive information should it be an option to do so, and your choice to seek such information about Your Users. If you choose to provide any sensitive information, it may be used by Life.Church to create a more personalized or efficient Platform experience like other non-sensitive information you provide. In any event, Life.Church will only process sensitive data provided to us for Life.Church’s legitimate activities on your behalf and will not disclose this information. We will maintain your information subject to appropriate safeguards discussed in this policy and otherwise provided by Life.Church. Should you have any questions, feel free to contact us at [info@online.church](mailto:info@online.church).

Use For Other Services

We may combine the information you submit under your account with information you provide us through other Life.Church services and products as well as inferences we make from this information to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of all services and products provided to you by Life.Church.

If you use the Platform from a mobile device, that device may send us data about your device and GPS location based on your phone settings and access you have granted to the Platform.

We use this information to provide an efficient Platform experience for you and to communicate with you more effectively. The information is also collected to determine the aggregate number of unique devices using the Platform and/or parts of the Platform, track total usage, and analyze usage data to improve Platform functionality for all Members and Visitors.

We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy to fulfill our obligations under our Terms of Use, the purpose for which you provide it, for any other purpose you request when you provide the information, or for any other purpose for which we have your consent.

Disclosure by You

When information is shared through the Platform, that information is viewable by you and by anyone else you chose to share it with. If you give access to your Platform account to other applications and services, based on your approval, those services would then have access to your shared information. The use, collection and protection of data you collect and receive through the Platform from Your Users or otherwise is your sole responsibility.

Internal Disclosure

We may share personal data received through the Platform internally within Life.Church to help combine the personal information covered across the different aspects of the Platform and our other products and services to help provide services to you in a manner that is personalized and useful to you and others. For example, we can personalize potential services to recommend to you using cookies or similar technologies that track what functionality you have already opted to receive.

Disclosure to Our Service Providers

We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy to contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use solely to support the Platform (such as cloud hosting, maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, communication, and development). For example, some of the services used to send emails and notifications are built and managed by third parties, so some of your information is sent securely to those services to provide such functionality. They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.

Legal Process

It is possible that we will need to disclose information collected through the Platform when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of the Platform; or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of Life.Church, our Members and/or Visitors, Your Users, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data and the personal data of users of Member Websites when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overboard, vague, or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.

#### Your Rights to Deleting, Accessing and Correcting Your Information

For personal data that we have about you or Your Users, you and Your Users have the following rights:

* Deletion: You or Your Users may ask us to erase or delete all or some of the personal data we have about you or Your Users . Please note that doing so may limit the ability to use certain functionality of the Platform. Please note that an email address is required to have a Member account.
* Correction/Modification: You or Your Users may edit some of the personal data associated with accounts on the Platform or Your Websites or ask us to change, update, or fix that data in certain cases, including if it’s inaccurate.
* Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: You or Your Users can ask us to stop using all or some of the personal data we have about you or Your Users (for example, if you have no legal basis to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (for example, if we come to believe that personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).
* Right to Access and/or Take Your Data: You or Your Users can ask us for a copy of the personal data of you or Your Users that has been provided to us.

To make these or any other requests with respect to your personal information, you or Your Users may send us an e-mail to [info@online.church](mailto:info@online.church).

We ask that individuals making requests identify themselves and identify the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before we process any requests. If Your Users make such a request, we may also notify you to verify the identity of the user and the accuracy of their request. We may decline to process requests if we cannot verify the requestor's identity, if we believe the request will jeopardize the privacy of others, if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect, or for a similar legitimate purpose. In any case, where we provide information access, deletion or correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.

If you choose to close your account or ask that we modify or delete some or all of your personal information, we will retain your personal data if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our Terms of Use or fulfill any others requests from you (for example, to opt-out of further messages or for a copy of your data).

Life.Church reserves the right to maintain your information, including inferences made with your information after deletion of an account. We have no control of information you have shared with others through the Platform or what information you allow Your Users to share through the Platform after you close your account or have asked to delete information or attempted to delete your account yourself. Your information and content you have shared may continue to be displayed in the services of others (for example, search engine results) until they refresh their cache.
