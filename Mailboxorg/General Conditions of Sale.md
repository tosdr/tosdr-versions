For contracts with an indefinite term, the Provider shall notify the User if the credit balance drops below the amount required for two months’ use at the selected tariff.

(5) The User shall also be liable for fees arising from a third party's utilisation of the services of the User's user account (e.g., following negligent disclosure of the User's access data) unless the User can prove that he/she is not responsible for the utilisation of services.

(2) A consumer is any natural person who concludes a legal transaction for a purpose that cannot be predominantly attributed to either their commercial or their independent professional activity.

(3) A consumer with continuous residence outside of Germany shall be granted a right of withdrawal by the Provider in accordance with the paragraphs above even if the national law of the consumer does not provide for any right of withdrawal or if the withdrawal is subject to a shorter limitation period or a stricter form than regulated in the German Civil Code.

**Section 8 – Misuse, indemnification against damages**

(1) The User is not permitted to misuse the user account for purposes that contravene the contract or the law. The Parties define misuse in particular as follows:

(a) the dispatch of e-mails with falsified or intentionally deceptive sender information for the purpose of preparing for or carrying out a criminal act,

(b) the dispatch of prohibited e-mail marketing ("spam") as well as any instance of the User making his/her mailbox address available as a response address for spam sent via a third party,

(c ) the storage or dispatch of dialler programs ("diallers"), unless these are permitted by regulatory authorities,

(d) the storage or the transmission of viruses or similar malicious software ("malware") as well as programs whose dissemination is prohibited in accordance with Section 95a (3) of the Act on Copyright and Related Rights (UrhG) (software for the circumvention of copy protection),

(e) utilisation for the purpose of computer sabotage or of the unauthorised access of other Internet hosts (Sections 303a and 303b of the German Criminal Code \[StGB\]) as well as comparable acts or preparations thereto which lend themselves to being utilised for the execution of an illegal act,

(f) the storage or the dispatch of image, video, audio, text or other files in contravention of copyrights, trademark rights, name rights, competition rights or personal rights or of files which contain prohibited propaganda material or designators of unconstitutional organisations (Sections 86 and 86a of the German Criminal Code \[StGB\]) and

(g) the storage or the dispatch of pornographic material as defined in Sections 184-184c of the German Criminal Code (StGB) or of media listed in Section 24 Paragraph 1 of the Youth Protection Act (JuSchG) as being harmful to minors.

(2) The User is obligated to indemnify the Provider against all third-party claims raised against the Provider as a consequence of content which is distributed via the User's e-mail address, particularly due to alleged infringements of copyrights, trademark rights, name rights, competition rights, or personal rights. The entitlement to indemnification also encompasses any expenses incurred by the Provider for appropriate fact finding and legal defence.

(3) E-mails from third parties intended to deceive the user into revealing sensitive information through misrepresentation of the true sender ("phishing" e-mails) do not have to be forwarded by the Provider to the user's mailbox. Insofar as the Provider identifies such phishing e-mails, the Provider is permitted to block their receipt or delete already received phishing e-mails from the user's mailbox.  
  

**Section 9 – Term and termination of the contract**

(1) Depending on the plan, the user agreement can be concluded for an indefinite term or for a definite term. If a definite term of contract is agreed upon, ordinary termination effective before the end of the term of contract is excluded.

(2) Each party's right to extraordinary termination for cause shall remain unaffected. For the Provider, cause for termination may be a misuse of the Service as defined in Section 8. The termination must be made in text form in order to be valid.

(3) The Provider may terminate the contractual relationship ordinarily, duly observing a notice period of two weeks, effective at the end of a billing month.

**Section 10 – Deletion of user data**

(1) The Provider is entitled and has an obligation to the User to irretrievably delete all data of the user account following a retention period of 60 days after the closure of the limited user account. These include, in particular, all e-mails, address book and calendar entries, tasks, notes and files which belong to the user account. The 60-day retention period serves to give the User an opportunity to recover his/her data in the event that he/she inadvertently allowed the contract to expire. The User's right to obtain immediate deletion of the user's data shall remain unaffected.

(2) The User is obligated to back up any data which he/she would like to continue to use after the end of the contract in a timely manner prior to the end of the contract by downloading the data to the User's own storage medium.

(3) However, data whose continued storage is mandated according to tax law, commercial law or other statutory legislation shall be precluded from the erasure.

**Section 11 – Liability, data backup**

(1) The liability of the Provider for pecuniary damage is limited to instances of intent and gross negligence. In other cases, the Provider shall be liable for pecuniary damage only in the case of beach of duties whose fulfilment is required in order to enable the proper implementation of the contract in the first place and upon compliance with which the User may routinely rely (cardinal duties). In such a case, the Provider shall be liable solely for consequences which can be typically expected to arise. Section 44a of the German Telecommunications Act (TKG) shall prevail, provided that it relates to this standard's scope of application.

(2) The Provider can set up a backup service on a voluntary and not legally binding basis by which a copy of the stock of e-mails and/or other data of a respective User at a specific time ("snapshot") will remain stored for a period of seven days. In the event of the loss of data, e.g. in case of accidental deletion by the User, the User will be able to independently recover an earlier data stock with the aid of a snapshot, if any exist ("self-service backup"). However, the User does not have any contractual entitlement to this free-of-charge function. The User is also aware that the risk of data loss or damage to data cannot be entirely ruled out, even when the Provider observes the requirements of due care, and that this applies for both the original data as well as for any snapshots.

(3) It is the obligation of the User to regularly back up the data of his/her user account which is important to him/her on his/her own storage medium on a regular basis but no less frequently than a weekly basis. Data backup serves to reduce damage in the event of loss, which cannot be ruled out entirely, or in the event of data damage at the Provider's end; such a case can occur even if the Provider exercises the due care and diligence for the service in question. This shall remain the obligation of the User regardless of whether or not the Provider has also assumed the obligation to back up the data.

(4) The liability of the Provider for damage arising from injury to life, limb or health in accordance with the Product Liability Act or from the provision of a guarantee shall remain unaffected by the preceding paragraphs.

**Section 12 – Specifics for encrypted e-mails and other data**

Insofar as the User encrypts e-mails or other data in the user account, it is incumbent upon the User to take particular care with regard to the storage of the key required for decryption. If the key is lost, the decryption of e-mails and other data will no longer be possible. The Provider does not have a duplicate key, nor does it have any other means of recovering the User's encrypted data.

**Section 13 – Changes to the General Terms and Conditions**

(1) The Provider may make changes to these General Terms and Conditions where there is a legitimate interest in doing so. In particular, a legitimate interest may exist if a third party changes or refines technical standards, thereby necessitating an adjustment of the services of the Provider. The Provider shall notify the User of the intended change no later than six weeks before the time of the change. If the User does not object in text form within one month, his/her consent shall be deemed to have been given. In the notice the User will be given special indication of the right to object and option to terminate.

(2) Duly observing the procedure defined in Paragraph 1, the Provider may also increase the agreed gross fees if taxes incorporated therein or any regulatory fees are increased after the conclusion of the contract or if such fees are newly introduced. For its part, the Provider shall be obligated to lower gross fees if there is a decrease in or waiver of taxes incorporated therein or of any fees.

**Section 14 – Severability clause**

Should one of the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions should prove to be ineffective or impracticable, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The same shall apply in the event of any unintended omission or gap in provisions.

**Section 15 – Applicable law**

(1) The law of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the exclusion private international law, shall apply to the contractual relationship between Provider and User. However, German law shall not be applicable to consumers with a permanent residence abroad if national legislation to which the consumer is subject contains provisions which do not permit deviation by means of contractual arrangements at the expense of the consumer.

(2) In the event that the User is a merchant, a public-law entity or a special fund under public law, the parties agree that the address registered in the commercial register as the Provider's domestic business address shall be the place of performance and the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes in connection with the legal relationships regulated here.

(2) Duly observing the procedure defined in Paragraph 1, the Provider may also increase the agreed fees if taxes incorporated therein or any regulatory fees are increased after the conclusion of the contract or if such fees are newly introduced. For its part, the Provider shall be obligated to lower fees if there is a decrease in or waiver of taxes incorporated therein or of any fees.  
  

**Section 11 – Severability clause**

Should one of the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions should prove to be ineffective or impracticable, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The same shall apply in the event of any unintended omission or gap in provisions.  
  
**Section 12 – Choice of law**

The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the exclusion private international law, shall apply to the contractual relationship between Provider and User. However, German law shall not be applicable to consumers with a permanent residence abroad if national legislation to which the consumer is subject contains provisions which do not permit deviation by means of contractual arrangements at the expense of the consumer.
