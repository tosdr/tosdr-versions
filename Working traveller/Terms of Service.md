* WT reserves the right to make changes or modifications to these terms, or any policy or guideline of our services, at any time and in our sole discretion. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions on our services, and you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your continued use of our services following the posting of changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Accordingly, you should frequently review these terms and applicable policies and guidelines to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the services. Please refer to our privacy policy for information about how Working Traveller collects, uses and discloses information about our members.

#### Sign up and your account

2. Provide accurate, truthful, current and complete information when creating an account.

5. Promptly notify WT if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the services.
6. Take responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and accept all risks of any authorised or unauthorised access.

#### Interactions with other members

* WT provides a social network for travellers to find paid and voluntary work with hosts around the world., You will engage in activities, communicate and negotiate with one another and make plans to provide/receive pay and unpaid work.
* We don’t allow our members to use WT to contact each other to make offers of work or volunteering outside of WT. Also, members can’t use information obtained from WT to contact each other about work outside of WT.
* If you receive an offer to agree on a work placement outside eBay, please [report it](https://www.workingtraveller.com/workandtravel/hosts/host-customer-support/).
* Make sure you follow these guidelines. If you don’t, you may be subject to a range of actions, including suspension of your account.
* WT is not party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our services.
* We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our services to improve the quality of the service and to make sure there is no misuse of the service. Any profile that consistently request users information so interact with them outside of WT will be removed from the service.

#### Travellers

* WT’s services are completely free to travellers who have standard membership. You will never be forced to upgrade to full membership that currently costs 10 euro per year. You can set up and manage hundreds of work placements around the world on the standard membership and are not required at any stage to upgrade. This means you can use the service for free.
* The only thing that full membership has that standard membership does not is that it allows references to appear on your profile. If you wish to have this service and not pay for it, all you need to do is to complete 2,000 editorial points and you are given, subject to a review of the quality of the editing, full membership for one year only. Once that membership expires you will need to either pay for another year’s membership or do another 2,000 editing points.
* The quality of the editing points is at the discretion of WT and if it is felt that any member has not produced editorial content that is at a high enough standard to warrant full membership they will be contacted. Anyone using spam techniques to gain full membership will be deleted without being contacted.

#### Hosts

* Host accounts will always be free and hosts references in their profiles will also always be free, as it is seen that the value of WT is the number of quality hosts in the world who have work on offer to travellers. The idea is to always give all our services to hosts for free. There may come a time when additional services are offered to hosts that may have a one off, or annual fee. They are not planned for and unlikely to happen.
* But say hosts feedback asks for a content management system for them to manage hundreds of work placements for them or a charity wants 300 bespoke host placements added to the site and integrated into their existing web sites back end – there may be a cost. For normal hosts who want to advertisement work and get travellers to come and stay, the basic account with references will always be free.

#### Identity verification

* WT cannot and does not confirm each member’s identity. The profile references are intended to help you make a judgement of a traveller or host, but it is only a judgement and cannot be taken as an endorsement from WT.
* You are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of other members with whom you may interact through WT’s services. WT does not represent or warrant that our references and thumbs up and thumbs down are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact and arrange to work with with another member. Furthermore, WT do not endorse any persons who use or register for our services.
* WT does not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the services. WT encourages you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time. This is why a profile that is a few years old, and has over 20 good reviews will be of real help to making your decision of what you will do. It is, however, a guide and not a guarantee.
* Because WT’s services are merely a platform to introduce travellers and hosts, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute.
