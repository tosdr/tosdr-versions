Privacy Notice
==============

Netaktion LLC (“**Netaktion**”) respects your right to privacy. This Privacy Notice explains who we are, how we collect, share and use personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights. This Notice applies to personal information that we collect through our website at [https://www.allmusic.com](https://www.allmusic.com/ "AllMusic"), (“**Website**”) and which we collect when you use or interact with our products and services. If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, then please contact us using the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Notice.

1\. What Does Netaktion Do?
---------------------------

Netaktion provides advertising technology products and services. We are headquartered in the U.S. For more information regarding our business, please visit the website link set out above.

2\. What is Targeted Advertising?
---------------------------------

Certain of our products and services involve the provision of targeted advertising. This involves providing tailored advertising to online users based on their interests and behaviors. Crucially, our targeted advertising is conducted at an "audience" or a "segment" level (e.g., males in Chicago aged 25-34 who like cars) and so does not directly identify individuals.

We do not intentionally collect information that identifies you (such as your name, address, phone number, or email address) as part of our targeted advertising activities, and we prohibit our partners from sharing this information with us. We act on behalf of our customers in providing any targeted advertising products and services.

3\. What Personal Information Does Netaktion Collect and Why?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories:

* _Information that you provide voluntarily_  
      
    Certain parts of our Website or services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we may ask you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with us, to subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit inquiries to us. The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.  
    

* _Information that we collect automatically_  
      
    **Our Website**  
      
    When you visit our Website, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.  
      
    Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g., country or city-level location) and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our Website, including the pages accessed and links clicked.  
      
    Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Website, where they come from, and what content on our Website is of interest to them. We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors.  
      
    **Our Products and Services**  
      
    We may collect browser-based information regarding how you interact with advertising placed via our products and services. This information may include the following: (i) technographic data related to the browser, operating system, and device, such as the name and version of your browser, (ii) connection data (such as the device’s current IP address), (iii) the current website visited, (iv) the website visited before the current website, (v) the title of the game for any in-game advertising, (vi) search terms, (vii) the date and time of the website visit, (viii) whether you have clicked on the advertising of our customer/our customer's website, visited the advertiser’s website, or undertaken a transaction with the advertiser, (ix) information like the aforementioned regarding the activity of users who share full length or shortened links via social media channels.  
      
    We may also collect from our customers/partners certain non-identifying demographic information about users such as their gender, approximate regional location (e.g., country and town), and age, or generic categories about users and their interests (e.g., "female sports fan").  
      
    We may collect general health related information in association with customized advertising campaigns. General health-related information that is not based on a precise medical treatment or condition can include, but is not limited to the following examples: acne, allergies, dental, vision, heartburn, cold and flu, sinus, headache, back pain, first aid, sore throat and cholesterol management. In addition, interest in subjects such as diet, nutrition, exercise, beauty, hair removal, health and fitness may also be collected. Note that such information is only collected/processed at an aggregate level and solely in the U.S. and Canada. This information is not collected in relation to individuals located in the European Economic Area.  
      
    Certain customers may choose to implement our Po.st technology, which facilitates the sharing of web content. When users use the Po.st services, we may receive information about which channel was used for sharing or receiving content (e.g. a social network or email). In addition, if a user uses Po.st to send an URL link to another user, and the user clicks on the sent URL link, we may also receive the above browser-based information related to this user.  
      
    If you are using our products/services via a mobile application, we may use the Apple IFA, Android Advertiser ID, or other device information that uniquely identifies a mobile device in order to match certain information that we collect via the mobile application.  
      
    In certain territories, advertisers may also elect to run Netaktion Surveys after their advertisements. "Netaktion Surveys" are short surveys that users can voluntarily elect to participate in and where such survey responses may be used to create lookalike models that are not tied to a specific user. Such survey questions are a way for advertisers to obtain information directly from users about their interests. Users might be asked, for instance, "Which of the following comedy programs do you watch?" with a drop-down menu of TV shows, or "How frequently do you travel for business?" with a drop down menu of different options. We may place cookies, or collect mobile device identifiers, associated with this survey information or inferences or data segments we create from it. We may use the information we collect from Netaktion Surveys in all of the ways we use the other information described in this Privacy Notice.  
      
    We use Google Analytics for aggregated, anonymized website traffic analysis. In order to track your session usage, Google drops a cookie (\_ga) with a randomly-generated ClientID in your browser. This ID is anonymized and contains no identifiable information like email, phone number, name, etc. We also send Google your IP Address. We use GA to track aggregated website behavior, such as what pages you looked at, for how long, and so on. This information is important to us for improving the user experience and determining site effectiveness. If you choose to opt out of this anonymized process please visit [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout "Opt out of Google Analytics")  
    

* _Information that we obtain from third party sources_  
      
    From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources (including BlueKai or LiveRamp), but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.  
      
    The types of information we collect from third parties include cookie and device IDs and we use the information we receive from these third parties to provide Targeted Advertising.  
    

4\. Cross-Application and Cross-Device Technology
-------------------------------------------------

We and/or our customers may use technology that establishes connections among related devices (such as mobile devices and desktop computers) both to deliver advertising that may be more relevant to you, as well as for analytics and reporting purposes. This means that information about your use of websites or applications on one of your devices may be combined with information from your other devices.

We may also partner with third parties to provide such cross-device technology to our customers, and in doing so, we may share anonymous identifiers with those third parties in order to make connections among related devices. We may also use your device’s IP address to infer connections among related devices within the same household. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow the instructions set out in the Opting-out of Cookies Usage div below.

5\. Who Does Netaktion Share My Personal Information With?
----------------------------------------------------------

We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:

* to our group companies, third party services providers and partners who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information. For example, partners like LiveRamp may place or recognize a cookie on your computer, device, or directly in our emails/communications, and we may share personal information with them if you have submitted such information to us, such as your name, postal address, email address, or device ID. Our partners may link the personal information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.

Specifically, our servers are located in the US and the Netherlands, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.

After 18 months, all of the stored data is destroyed. Summarized data is kept indefinitely.
