Device ID/Information may be collected through the use of the following technologies:

Cookies and Local Storage. Cookies and local storage are text files placed within a browser on a device when it is used to visit the Services. Certain web browsers and browser add-ons may provide additional local data storage mechanisms. We may use cookies and similar technologies to help keep your use of the Services more secure, to study traffic patterns on the Services, to study the effectiveness of our customer communications, to maintain the integrity of the Services, to measure crash analytics and other maintenance related information, to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Services, and to personalize your experience through the Services, such as to recognize you when you return to the Services. Most browsers provide you with the ability to disable, decline, or clear cookies and local storage; please check your browser’s settings for further information. However, if you disable cookies you may find this affects your ability to use certain parts of the Services. For more information about cookies, please visit [https://www.aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/).

Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as web beacons or pixel tags or 1x1 GIFs or clear GIFs) may be included in our web pages and email messages. These and similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Services, to monitor how users navigate Services, to count how many of our email messages were opened, or to count how many particular products were viewed. The information we collect through this technology may include the first date and time you open our email, and whether you click any links included in our email.

Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with the Services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.

Software Development Kits (SDKs). These are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps. These tools can be used to create and operate features that collect information from your device.

Data Collection from Mobile Devices. We use embedded scripts and the tools provided in SDKs to collect information from mobile devices such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website usage behavior. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes.

b. Session Replay Technology. Chegg may record through session replay technology your interaction with user interfaces, how long you visit those pages, and any links you click or information you provide. We use this information for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve the Chegg websites and our products and Services, and to address functionality issues.

##### B. Data You Provide Directly.

a. Live Chat Features. When you participate in our chat features, such as Chegg Support sessions or an AI assisted feature, we can record, use, and retain your information provided, as well as the communications within the chat, for purposes of providing you the Services and allowing you to participate in the feature, assisting you during the conversation, providing related support for your account, subscription, or services, and to improve the Services. If you do not consent, please do not continue with chat features.

b. Video Call Recording. If you use our Skills Service, we may record video calls between instructors and students, for example one-to-one meetings between instructors and students and class instruction sessions for quality assurance and security purposes. If we record such a call, notice will be provided to you within the video call tool.

c. Photos and Videos. We allow you to post photos and videos on the Services or to submit them to us as described above. Applicable laws and regulations may vary with respect to whether such materials are considered to be biometric information. For clarity, Chegg does not create a record of facial geometry from your photos or videos, and does not use your photos or videos for the purposes of facial recognition, facial surveillance, or otherwise as a biometric identifier. Please note, however, that to the extent that you post your photos or videos publicly on our Services, or we share – as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy – such materials with third parties who are permitted to use these materials in accordance with their own privacy policies, we do not control the actions of third parties, and their use of your photos or videos may differ from ours.

d. Employment Applications. If you apply for a job through our Services, we or our service provider(s) may ask you to provide self-identifying information such as your veteran status, gender, and ethnicity in conjunction with laws and regulations enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. Providing such information is voluntary, but if you do provide such information, we and/or our service provider may submit that information to the appropriate government or regulatory agencies to fulfill reporting requirements and use that information to defend against employment-related complaints. Please note that we may utilize a careers portal that is operated by a third party, in which case, your registration and use of the careers portal will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices as disclosed on the portal.

e. Registration to Become an Instructor. When you register to be an Instructor, we will collect information from you such as your education and employment history, phone number, photo, country of residence, and information we need to process payments to you, such as your bank account information, social security number, or taxpayer identification number, as necessary to facilitate payment and to comply with related legal obligations.

If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, as required by law, or as permitted by the Promotion’s terms or official rules (such as on a winner’s list).

##### C. Data We Receive or Collect from Third Parties

a. Referral Features. We may make available referral functions that permit you to send invitations, content, or other information directly to a third party through the Services. If you send a communication using such functionality, the information you provide about the recipient (e.g., name and e-mail address) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person. Any information you provide in connection with sending the message, (e.g., your name and your email address) will, of course, be disclosed to the recipient. When you disclose any personal information relating to other people, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

b. Information from Other Third Parties. We may receive information about you from third parties, such as business partners, data providers who enhance the information we have about you, sources of publicly available information, and other users of the Services (such as when they provide your information to send you one of our products or participate in a “refer a friend” or similar programs that we may offer).

D. Data We Disclose to Third Parties. We may share non-personal information, such as certain Usage Information, hashed or otherwise de-identified or pseudonymized data, and aggregated user statistics, with third parties in our discretion and as permitted by law, including for targeted advertising purposes. We may share the information we have collected about you (including Personal Information) in the circumstances described below or elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, as disclosed at the time you provide information or otherwise with your consent. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without giving you the chance to consent (opt-in or where permitted by law, opt-out). In the case of phone numbers collected through our SMS/MMS/text message programs, we will only share this information with third parties that help provide the SMS/MMS/text messaging service for us (including, but not limited to, platform providers, phone companies, and other vendors).. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party. If you decide that you do not want to receive communications from a third party, or have questions about their privacy practices, you will need to contact that third party directly.

a. Academic Investigations. Certain of our Services have an associated Honor Code, and these may vary according to your location. If you use such Services, you agree to abide by the Honor Code applicable to your country as part of your use of the Services. We may disclose personal information in accordance with the terms of the applicable [Honor Code.](https://www.chegg.com/en-US/honorcode)

c. Publicly Available Content and Other Disclosures At Your Direction. User Content and profile information may be available to other registered users of the Services and other visitors to the Services, such as if you post a public comment. In addition, the Services may allow you to communicate and collaborate with each other, including via video chat or text chat. We may also share information when you direct us to do so, such as if you consent to post your testimonial along with your name, if you choose to link your account with a social networking service or other third party application or feature through which information is shared, if you apply for tuition assistance through a lender, or if we present you with an opportunity to receive marketing offers from a third party. We do not control the actions of third parties and you post content and share your information at your own risk.

d. Third Party Offers/Bundled Products. We may offer through the Services the services of a third party, or we may offer our Services to you through a third party. In those instances, by signing up for the third party service or signing up for our Services through a third party, you are agreeing and directing us, to disclose your information to that third party (or parties), and your information will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. This includes, without limitation, instances in which you use our Services to purchase products or services provided, in whole or part, by third parties. You also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or social media feature, that we share information about you with a third party or publicly.

e. Other Business Partners. Some portions of our Services are operated by third parties as discussed above. When you use the Services to interact with those third parties, your interactions are governed by their privacy policy. This may include Zoom (Privacy Policy: [https://explore.zoom.us/en/privacy/](https://explore.zoom.us/en/privacy/)). We may share certain information with the third party business partner with whom you interact. The information may include your personal information, which the third party may use for the purpose of directly sending you communications and promotional materials regarding their goods and/or services, directly or through the Services.

f. Disclosures During Business Transfers. In the event Chegg goes through a business transition, Chegg reserves the right to disclose and transfer all personal information related to the Services (including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process): (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Services; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, bankruptcy, the sale of certain of Chegg’s ownership interests, assets, or both, or other company change. By providing your information, you understand and agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent, except where required by law.

g. Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf. We may share information with third-party service providers or allow those third parties to collect information about you, to enable them to perform services on our behalf, such as website hosting, conducting website usage analytics, sending email, text, or other communications, fulfilling orders, providing marketing assistance and data analysis, processing payments, and other services. Additionally, we may share various information relating to our users and fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activities with our fraud prevention and similar service providers, and they will use this information to help us and their other clients prevent fraudulent and illegal transactions.

h. Social Media and Other Third Party Platforms. We may host or facilitate interactions with social media or other third party platforms, such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, and LinkedIn, including the use of their login service. When you interact with these third party platforms through the Services, we will receive information about you from the third party platform service and you will be choosing to share information about your interactions with Chegg with that social media service.

In addition, the third party platform service may set their own cookies and collect information about your use of the Services, including your IP address or other device identifiers, and which pages you visit on the Services. These third party platforms may be able to collect certain information on your visits to the Services regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account with the third party platform. If you are logged out or do not have an account and visit a page with a social plug-in, your browser sends a more limited set of information. Like other sites, the third party platform will receive information about the webpage you are visiting, the date and time of your visit, and other browser-related information. They may use that information to help them improve their products or for other purposes set forth in their privacy policy. We may also receive information about you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or "friends."

The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including, without limitation, whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but may retain the information previously collected.

If you choose to post information to a third-party platform, that information may be public.

#### 3\. Third Party Advertising and Analytics/Privacy Controls/Do-Not-Track

Chegg works with third party business partners, including online advertising companies, ad agencies, and analytics providers to serve Chegg ads online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (like cookies and web tags) on your device, and they may otherwise collect or have access to Device ID/Information and other information about you, some of which may be personal data or personal information under various state laws. Some of these parties may collect personal data over time when you visit the Services or other online websites and services. We may share information, typically information that has been aggregated or de-identified, pseudonymized, Device ID/Information, and location information with third party advertising companies, analytics providers, and other third parties, including for the purpose of serving you more relevant ads on and off the Services.

If you would like to opt-out of third party advertising and analytics, there are a variety of tools available to you:

Our Cookie Opt-Out Tools. To opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information (targeted advertising) via cookies, use the tool available in footer of this webpage. Note that you will need to do this on each of our Services for which you would like to exercise this opt-out right. To opt out of other forms of processing of your personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, please complete this [form.](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/a21a74f4-2f93-44a2-a887-302a9213c997/06b040b7-49eb-464a-b19a-ea35c85c79fc) If you are a California resident, please see our NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS regarding additional rights you have, including how to exercise your “Do Not Sell” and “Do Not Share” rights.

Do Not Track. Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals offered by some web browsers are settings that request that a web application disable its tracking of an individual user. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and/or other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. You can learn more about and [set up Do Not Track here](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

Global Privacy Controls. Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) is a technical specification in your browser settings that you can use to automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online tracking. You can find out more about and [set up GPC here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about).

NAI/DAA Opt-Out. Some of the companies we use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). The NAI provides information regarding targeted advertising and the [opt-out procedures of NAI members](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/), including opt-out mechanisms for web browsers, mobile and other connected devices, and a tool to opt out from participating NAI members using your hashed email address for interest-based advertising. You may also want to visit the [DAA's website](https://optout.aboutads.info/), which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an opt-out for DAA-participating companies.

Mobile Device/AppChoices. Mobile devices may contain settings that allow you to disable tracking advertising and/or analytics. In addition, the digital advertising industry has provided the ability for mobile users to register at [AppChoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) for their intent not to receive targeted advertising.

Google Analytics/Adobe Analytics. We use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about the use of the Services report on activities and trends. These services may also collect information about the use of other websites, apps, and online services. You can [learn about Google's practices](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites), and opt out of them by downloading the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)[Learn about Adobe's practices here](https://www.adobe.com/privacy.html)

Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising, and that you will continue to receive generic ads while online. Your opt-out choices are browser and device specific; if you disable your cookies, upgrade your browser after opting out or if you use multiple different devices, please opt-out on each device and each browser separately.

Legal Basis for Processing

We will collect, store, or otherwise process personal information collected from you in the EU/EEA or the UK only in the following situations:

When we have your consent to do so. For example, if you opt in to receive promotional emails. You can withdraw your consent at any time as described below or directly through the Services.

When we need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g. providing the Services you have requested).

When we or a third party have a legitimate interest in processing your Personal Data. For example, we may process your personal data to communicate with you about our Services, to provide, secure, and improve our Services, and, in certain circumstances, to deliver advertising to you. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data that is based on our legitimate interests, but doing so may result in your inability to use our Services.

When we are required by law to process the Personal Data.

Automated Decision Making. We may use technologies considered automated decision making or profiling. We will not make automated decisions about you that would significantly affect you, unless such a decision is necessary as part of a contract we have with you, we have your consent, or we are permitted by law to use such technology. You may escalate any concerns you have by contacting us below.
