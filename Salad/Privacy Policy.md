Your personal privacy is very important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

This privacy policy applies to all information collected through the [salad.com](https://salad.com/salad.com) website and associated application. Salad only requires your email address and IP address. Some additional information may be needed for specific item redemptions.

Personally identifiable information collected by us will only be used for the purpose of providing you with our service. We collect this information so that you will be able to access your account and so that we will be able to transfer mined cryptocurrencies to your account. We may also send you email notifications from time to time concerning your account, application updates, and relevant news and information.

Sensitive and private data exchange between you and our site/application happens over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures. However, it is important to understand that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal identification information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites that link to our site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.

We retain the right to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
