The material on this website was written to provide a guideline for care.

In 2017, FARE developed an online database where colleges and universities have the opportunity to indicate the ways they accommodate students with food allergies and celiac disease. While the schools may have undergone an audit from FARE, the data in the college search database is information self-reported directly by the institutions without guidance or input from FARE. The information provided in this database is designed to support a site visitorâ€™s consideration of food allergy accommodations in the college and university setting. Site visitors are encouraged to contact the colleges and universities directly with any questions or inquiries about food allergy accommodations.

FARE does not review, test, sponsor, endorse or recommend any products or services that may appear on our website.
