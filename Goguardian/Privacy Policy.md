1\. The Information We Collect and the Ways We Use It

### 1.1 Information Provided Directly

We collect the following information directly from you as a visitor of our Website or from your School, if it lists you as a representative:

If you then interact with our Website, we may combine the information about your activity with our advertisement with the information we subsequently collect and/or you subsequently submit on our Website.
* **_Location Information_:** When you use the Services, we and our service providers collect general location information from your computer or mobile device. “General” location information means information about the city and state in which your device is located based on its IP address. We may also obtain general location when you input your zip code or use location features on the Services, such as to find nearby merchants.  
* **_Cookies:_** We and our third party partners use Cookies. To learn more about our use of Cookies and your choices about Cookies, please see our Cookies Notice below.

### 1.3 How We Disclose Information Collected Through Our Website

We may disclose any of the information collected from our Website in the following ways:

* **_Third Parties Supporting Our Website:_** We disclose information with service providers that assist us in performing business-related functions that support or improve our Website. For example, we use hosting services and customer service tools to support our Website. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
* **_Third Parties that Provide Advertising Services_**. We may use third party advertising services that collect or receive certain information about you and/or your visit to the Website to provide ads about our products and services on other sites or to measure and analyze ad performance.
* **_Our Protection and Others:_** We may share or disclose the information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to (i) protect or defend the rights, safety, or property of us or our third parties, including to defend or enforce our Website Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Service, or our EULA, or any other contractual arrangement or (ii) to respond to claims that content violates the rights of third parties.
* **_Legal Requirements:_** We may share or disclose the information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to comply with any law enforcement, legal, or regulatory process, such as to respond to a warrant, subpoena, court order, or other applicable laws and regulations.

* **_Business Transfer:_** We may share or disclose the information, in connection with or during negotiations of any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, Liminex will comply with such restrictions. The successor entity will be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, including privacy laws.

### 1.4 Data Controller vs. Processor; Our Legal Basis for Using Your Information

Under applicable law, we are considered the "data controller" of information from or about our Website visitors. In other words, we are responsible for deciding how to collect, use, share, and disclose this information.

The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Union ("**EU**") require companies to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing your information. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:

* **_Contractual Commitments:_** We may use, share, or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, to comply with our [Website Terms](https://www.goguardian.com/terms/), which you accept by browsing our otherwise using our Website.
* **_With Your Consent:_** Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of your consent.
* **_Legitimate Interests:_** In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Website, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.
* **_Legal Compliance:_** We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.

### 1.5 How Long We Keep Information

We generally retain information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes above. We consider the nature and sensitivity of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests in determining how long to retain information.  The purposes for which we use information may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, if you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request. To dispose of any personal information, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional time period of time.

### 1.6 How We Protect Your Information

We take the security and privacy of your data very seriously. For these reasons, we have implemented various technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information. These safeguards vary depending on the sensitivity of the information at issue.

We are committed to preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data, and will investigate any possible occurrence. In the event of a breach of personal data, we will comply with all relevant breach laws.

### 1.7 Your Rights and Choices

#### 1.7.1 Privacy Rights

Residents of certain jurisdictions (including the EEA, UK, California, Colorado, and Virginia) may request that we:

* provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you
* update information which is out of date or incorrect
* delete certain information which we are holding about you
* restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information

Please note that your rights may vary depending upon your jurisdiction and be subject to exceptions under law.  

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@goguardian.com. Authorized agents for California residents may submit requests at: [https://www.goguardian.com/ccpa-requests](https://www.goguardian.com/ccpa-requests).  We may require proof of the written authorization you have given.

We will consider all of your requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include needing to continue processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.

Virginia residents may appeal the denial of a request here: privacy@goguardian.com. We will respond within the legally required time period, including a written explanation of the results of your appeal.  In addition to those rights, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.

#### 1.7.2 Privacy Choices: Do Not Sell or Share or Process My Personal Information for Targeted Advertising 

Residents of certain states such as California and Virginia and Colorado may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  Such residents may also opt out of the sharing or processing of their personal information for targeted advertising. Applicable law broadly defines “sale” or “share” in a way that may include allowing third parties to receive certain information such as cookies, IP address, device identifiers, browsing behavior and/or other activity for targeted advertising. As such, we may share or process for targeted advertising to you the following categories of information for such purposes which may be considered a sale: device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage, geolocation information, such as city; and inference data.

If you or your authorized agent would like to opt out of the use of your information for such purposes, you may do so as outlined on the following page:  Do Not Sell My Personal Information.

You may still receive advertising; it just may not be tailored to your interests.  Please note, if you use different browsers or devices, you will need to make your choice on each browser or device you want your choice to apply. In some cases, you may also be presented with a form field to complete, in those cases we ask for your email address or other information so we may add it to an appropriate suppression list. 

Please note that if you have a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser (such as Global Privacy Control), we recognize such preference in accordance with and to the extent required by applicable law (in the locations required).

In addition to the rights and choices identified above with respect to specific jurisdictions, you have certain rights and choices with respect to your information such as:

* **_Marketing Communications:_** You can decline promotional communications at the point information is requested for such purpose on our Website (e.g., by checking or un-ticking (as directed) the relevant box) or, by following the unsubscribe instructions on communications sent to you. You can also contact us as described in the "How to Contact Us" section below.
* **_Cookies & Analytics._** You can opt out of certain cookie-related and analytics processing by following the instructions in our Cookie Notice below.
* **_Do Not Track:_** Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. At this time, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, but we do recognize opt out preference signals as set forth above.  
    

### 1.8 Additional Information for California Residents

If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information.  We collect the following categories of personal information: identifiers (such as your name and email address); internet or other network information (how you interact with the our Website); location information (because your IP address may indicate your general location); inference data about you (for example, what product you may be interested in); and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you (such as your correspondence with us). For more information about what we collect, the sources of such collection, please see the “The Information We Collect and the Ways We Use It” section above. For more information about how we treat information in our products, please visit our [Privacy Policy for Product Users](https://www.goguardian.com/policies/product-privacy). 

We collect personal information for the following purposes:

* provide you with our Website;
* respond to your requests and provide you with support;
* notify you via email of new features and products that may be of interest to you;
* notify you of company updates and notable events;
* analyze and improve our Website;
* audit and understand the effectiveness of our placement of our advertisements on third party websites;
* remind you of us through advertisements after you have used our Website;
* secure our Website and help prevent fraud and enforce our legal terms; and
* administer and troubleshoot our Website.

As described above, California law broadly defines “sale” or “share” in a way that may include allowing third parties to receive certain information to enable the delivery of targeted advertising on the or other sites. As such, we may share the following categories of information for such purposes which may be considered a sale (as defined by California law):device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage, geolocation information, such as city; and inference data.  

* If you or your authorized agent would like to opt out of the use of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale), you may do so as outlined on the following page: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.
* **_Shine the Light Disclosure:_** The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

We retain your information as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect it, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. We consider the nature and sensitivity of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests in determining how long to retain information.  Different processing purposes may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, if you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request.

* We may also protect personal data through other legally valid methods, including international data transfer agreements.**_‍_**
* **_Other Legal Rights:_** Some international users (including those whose information we collect under the Framework) of our Website have certain legal rights to access certain information we hold about them and to request its deletion. For example, some international laws may permit you to:

We have been granted the iKeepSafe COPPA Safe Harbor seal signifying that GoGuardian’s Website as well as the software that runs the Website and the GoGuardian Offerings (GoGuardian Admin, GoGuardian Teacher, and GoGuardian Beacon) have been reviewed and approved for having policies and practices surrounding the collection, use, maintenance and disclosure of personal information from children consistent with the iKeepSafe COPPA Safe Harbor program guidelines.
