Liminex Products Terms of Service and End User License Agreement
================================================================

Last Updated Date: August 30, 2024

Introduction
------------

Welcome! Before using any of our Offerings, please take the time to review this combined Terms of Service and End User License Agreement (EULA), together with any applicable Order Form(s), the [**Product Privacy Policy**](https://www.goguardian.com/policies/product-privacy), and, if applicable, the [**Data Processing Addendum**](https://www.goguardian.com/policies/dpa) (collectively, the “Agreement”). Capitalized words have the definitions set forth throughout this Agreement, including in Section 17 (Definitions).

**_When does this Agreement apply?_** This Agreement governs the use of the Offerings and is a binding contract between School (sometimes referred to as "School,” “you,” or “your”) and Liminex, Inc. doing business as GoGuardian and Pear Deck Learning, and acting on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (“Liminex”, “we,” “us”, or “our”). This Agreement is distinct from our [**Website Terms of Service**](https://www.goguardian.com/policies/terms), which governs only use of our Website.

BY CLICKING AN “I AGREE” OR “I ACCEPT” BUTTON; EXECUTING AN ORDER FORM THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT; COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS; OR INSTALLING OR USING ANY OFFERINGS IN ANY WAY, SCHOOL AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT IS ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A SCHOOL, SCHOOL DISTRICT, CORPORATION, ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, SUCH INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT THEY ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OLD AND HAVE THE AUTHORITY, THE RIGHT, AND THE CAPACITY TO LEGALLY BIND SUCH SCHOOL, SCHOOL DISTRICT, CORPORATION, ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE THE TERM “SCHOOL” SHALL REFER TO EACH SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES.

You are free to reject this Agreement, but if you do not agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, then you may not use any of our Offerings in any way.

IMPORTANT NOTICES:

* Section 15.2 contains provisions governing how claims are resolved between us, including a requirement for binding arbitration and class action waiver.
* You understand that use of some of our Offerings may require the consent for monitoring and recording information and communications of all users on the Managed Devices or Accounts under Applicable Law. You represent and warrant that you have obtained such requisite consent.
* We may make non-material modifications to this Agreement or changes that expand our obligations, reduce your obligations, or introduce a new product offering immediately without notice to you. Otherwise, we will only modify or replace this Agreement, after providing notice to you in accordance with Section 16.1. You are responsible for regularly reviewing your Account and our Website for any changes to the Agreement.
* Your use of, and participation in, certain Offerings may be subject to additional terms (“Supplemental Terms”) and such Supplemental Terms will either be listed in this Agreement, an Order Form or will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up to use the supplemental Offerings. If this Agreement is inconsistent with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will control with respect to the Offerings with which it applies.

i. _We have included, in italics at the beginning of each section, summaries that provide short explanations of the legal language in plain English to aid in understanding, but such summaries are not legally binding._

1\. Getting Access To and Started With Our Offerings
----------------------------------------------------

i. _This Section explains how to establish and maintain Account(s). This Section describes the importance of being mindful about the information and settings in an Account – the value of our tools is dependent on the accuracy of the information you provide and the proper selection of product settings._

We generally make our Offerings available on a paid subscription-based license. As further described in Section 4.1, from time to time and in its sole discretion, we may offer limited free, trial or beta Offerings at no additional charge. For the Pear Deck Tutor Offerings, we may offer pre-paid tutoring hours for a subscription term, in addition to the paid subscription-based licensing model.

### 1.1 Ordering

You may obtain Subscriptions to our Offerings either directly from us or one of our Affiliates or indirectly through one of our Authorized Resellers. If you purchase a Subscription to an Offering through an Authorized Reseller, you will enter into an Order Form directly with such Authorized Reseller and may be subject to additional terms as agreed upon between you and the Authorized Reseller. You expressly agree that this Agreement governs your access to and use of any Offering that you acquire from an Authorized Reseller, as well your relationship with us as to any products or services you purchase through an Authorized Reseller.  You further agree that we and our Affiliates have the right to enforce the terms of this Agreement with respect to such purchases. You also acknowledge that no Authorized Reseller is authorized to provide warranties with respect to any Offerings in excess of those provided by us in this Agreement. The terms regarding any value-added services provided to you by an Authorized Reseller are solely between you and the Authorized Reseller and we have no responsibility for any such services.

If during the Subscription Term, you would like to expand your base Subscription(s) to include additional licenses above your Licensed Capacity, please contact us so that we can send you an additional Order Form for those Add-Ons. If we do not hear from you and you deploy additional Licenses, we or, as applicable, an Authorized Reseller will send you an Order Form and invoice you for the subscriptions to the Add-Ons that you use above your Licensed Capacity. Add-Ons, once deployed and paid, will be rolled into your base Subscription.

### 1.2 Accounts

Before accessing certain Offerings, you may be required to create an Account. When setting up your Account, you may link your Offerings with your Google, Microsoft, and/or Learning Management System (“LMS”) account for ease of sign on and, for certain Offerings, to pull in a directory of Managed Accounts or Devices. In linking your Account to your Google, Microsoft, and/or LMS account, you are granting us access to certain account information from your Google, Microsoft, and/or LMS account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of that Google,Microsoft, or LMS account.

#### 1.2.1 

**Authorized Users.** Within your Account, you may have the ability to enable separate sub-accounts for Authorized Users. You are responsible for issuing and maintaining such sub-accounts only for appropriate Authorized Users, as well as issuing and maintaining appropriate permission settings for each Authorized User.

#### 1.2.2

**School Information.** When creating an Account, you agree to (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information necessary to create the Account and to deploy the Offerings you have subscribed to on Managed Devices or Accounts; and (b) promptly update any such information to maintain its accuracy and completeness during the Term. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree to provide and maintain accurate, up-to-date and complete School Profile Information, and for Accounts, Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, and Association Data.  You acknowledge and agree that proper implementation and operation of certain Offerings depends largely on the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information and Association Information ingested into the product; therefore, it is of the utmost importance that you take great care in maintaining and updating this Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information and Association Information at all times during the Term.

You are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and security of School Account Information, including protecting, and requiring your Authorized Users to protect, usernames and passwords associated with your Account, and notifying us immediately if you suspect or know that (1) a username and password is known by someone other than the applicable Authorized User; and/or (2) your Account (including any individual Authorized User account) has been compromised.

#### 1.2.3 

**Account Settings.** You are responsible for selecting and updating the settings in the Offerings you subscribe to as you see fit and ensuring that the selections comply with all Applicable Law, as well as any guidelines and requirements you have established, including, with respect to use of the GoGuardian Offerings, for monitoring Managed Devices or Accounts and parents’ or guardians’ authorization of such monitoring. If you have questions about any settings in an Offering or your Account, such as permissions and settings associated with Managed Devices or Accounts, please visit, as applicable, the GoGuardian [**Help Center**](https://help.goguardian.com/hc/en-us) and/or contact [**support@goguardian.com**](mailto:support@goguardian.com), or visit the Pear Deck [**Help Center**](https://help.peardeck.com/en?__hstc=181186424.a331f9cd231b0501655e39b86932d339.1628617317261.1637174793540.1637256220337.25&__hssc=181186424.1.1637256220337&__hsfp=431394172) and/or contact [**support@deck.peardeck.com**](mailto:support@deck.peardeck.com), or visit the Pear Assessment [**Help Center**](https://edulastic.com/help-center/?__hstc=181186424.a331f9cd231b0501655e39b86932d339.1628617317261.1637174793540.1637256220337.25&__hssc=181186424.1.1637256220337&__hsfp=431394172) and/or contact [**support@assessment.peardeck.com**](mailto:support@assessment.peardeck.com), or visit the Pear Deck Tutor [**Help Center**](https://help.tutorme.com/en/) and/or contact [**support@tutor.peardeck.com**](mailto:support@tutor.peardeck.com), or visit the Pear Practice [**Help Center**](https://support.giantsteps.app/s/) and/or contact [**support@practice.peardeck.com**](mailto:support@practice.peardeck.com).

### 1.3 Payment Terms

Fees due for initial orders, any Add-Ons to, and any subscription renewals of Offerings shall be set forth in the applicable Order Form (“Fees”). Fees for Subscriptions you purchase directly from Liminex or one its Affiliates shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of our issuance of an invoice for such purchases, unless otherwise stated on an Order Form. Payment obligations for purchases made through an Authorized Reseller shall be as agreed upon by you and the Authorized Reseller.

Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction; you are responsible for paying all such taxes, levies, duties and assessments associated with purchases and transactions under this Agreement.

Unless otherwise stated on an Order Form, Fees are paid in advance of each billing period. Payment obligations under this Agreement are non-cancelable and all Fees paid are non-refundable. Upon your cancellation or termination of any Subscription, you remain responsible for payment of all Fees allocable to the terminated portion of the Subscription Term referenced in the applicable Order Form without any refund owed to you, unless otherwise mutually agreed to in writing between you and us.

Upon notice to you, we may increase any Fees specified in an Order Form, provided the increase will not become effective until the expiration of the current Subscription Term. We may increase any Fees that are not specified in an Order Form at any time, with or without notice to you. We may allow you to continue using a free, trial or beta Offering on a paid Subscription basis, but your continued use and your Subscription would be subject to a completed Order Form and payment of the applicable Fee.

For certain Offerings, we will endeavor to notify you if your paid Account has delinquent fees. If delinquent fees are not paid, we will suspend your use of the Services.

2\. Offerings
-------------

i. _This Section explains more about the Offerings, including updates to such offerings and linkages with other third party integration software that we make available to you. Offerings may experience downtime or we may suspend access to Offerings in certain situations._

### 2.1 Access and Updates to Offerings

We will make our Offerings to which you have subscribed available to you, subject to the terms of this Agreement. From time to time, we may also make updates to the Offerings available to you. You agree that we may automatically install or add updates, upgrades, and new features to the Offerings that we deem to be reasonable, beneficial to you, and/or reasonably necessary without advance notice to you. You acknowledge and agree that any obligation we may have to support previous version(s) of any Offering may end when we release an update, upgrade, and/or additional feature for the Offering. The license granted for a Subscription shall apply to any updates, upgrades, and/or additional features that are not distributed with a separate license or other agreement. If we make any material changes to an Offering, we will notify you within the Offering interface or by sending you an email.

With respect to an Offering accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or Microsoft Store (each, an “App Store”) (an “App Store Sourced Application”), you acknowledge and agree that the availability of the App Store Sourced Application is dependent on the App Store.

### 2.2 Downtime and Suspension of Offerings

You acknowledge that you may experience downtime (a) as a result of our conducting maintenance; or (b) in connection with a force majeure event (as described in Section 16.5). In addition, you acknowledge that we, may at our discretion, suspend your access, or suspend access of one of your Authorized Users, to the Offerings for your breach, or your Authorized Users’ breach, of this Agreement, if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any School Account Information provided by you or any Authorized User is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if we deem it reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate harm to us, you, any other of our customers or a third party if the Offerings were not suspended, or to comply, in our sole discretion, with legal requirements.

### 2.3 Integrations with Offerings

We may allow you to access certain third party software or offerings (e.g., YouTube) through your Account via an application programming interface (“API”) or other technical connection (such software or offering, an “Integration Offering”). Because you control whether to integrate and use an Integration Offering, you are solely responsible for all interactions with the Integration Offering, including ensuring appropriate privacy, contractual, and other protections with it as well as ensuring that you are complying with any terms, such as the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms), you are required to agree with the provider of such Integration Offering depending on the Integration Offering being accessed. Integration Offerings are not “Offerings” under this Agreement and are not subject to any of the warranties, service commitments or other obligations with respect to Offerings hereunder. The availability of any Integration Offering through any of our Offerings does not imply our endorsement of or affiliation with the provider of such Integration Offering. We do not control any Integration Offering and will have no liability to you in connection with any Integration Offering. We have no obligation to monitor or maintain access to Integration Offerings, and may disable the ability to integrate with them or restrict access to any Integration Offerings at any time, with or without notice to you (though we, of course, will endeavor to provide notice of any such disabling whenever reasonably practicable under the circumstances). By using or enabling any Integration Offering, you are expressly permitting us and our Affiliates to disclose your School Profile Information, and, to the extent applicable to your Offering, your Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, Association Information or other information, including support requests and Log and Cookie Information to the extent necessary to utilize the Integration Offering. YOUR USE OF ANY INTEGRATION OFFERINGS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, CONDITIONS AND POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SUCH INTEGRATION OFFERINGS (SUCH AS TERMS OF SERVICE OR PRIVACY POLICIES OF THE PROVIDERS OF SUCH INTEGRATION OFFERINGS).

3\. Your Use of Offerings and Your Responsibilities
---------------------------------------------------

i. _This Section explains that Liminex licenses our Offerings to you for certain uses. Please use our Offerings responsibly and appropriately._

### 3.1 License Grant to You; Restrictions

We hereby grant to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license and right to use the specific Offering(s) as set forth in an Order Form and the related User Documentation, during the Subscription Term and solely for School’s internal business purposes.

The rights granted to School in this Agreement are subject to the following restrictions: School shall not (a) license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, reproduce, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit any portion of any Offering or User Documentation, or otherwise provide access to any portion of any Offering or User Documentation to any third party (other than Authorized Users, when and as permitted herein); (b) frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other portion of any Offering (including images, text, page layout or form); (c) use any metatags or other “hidden text” using the names or trademarks of Liminex or any of its Affiliates; (d) modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of any Offering or User Documentation; (e) use any manual or automated software, devices or other processes (including but not limited to spiders, robots, scrapers, crawlers, avatars, data mining tools or the like) to “scrape” or download data from any web pages contained in any Offering or User Documentation; (f) access any Offering or User Documentation in order to build a similar or competitive website, product or service; (g) access any Offering for purposes of monitoring its availability, performance or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes without our prior written permission; and (h) remove any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in any Offering or User Documentation. Any future release, update or other addition to any Offering shall be subject to this Agreement. We and our suppliers reserve all rights not granted in this Agreement. Any unauthorized use of an Offering terminates your right to use all Offerings.

### 3.2 School Responsibilities

School will (a) be responsible for Authorized Users’ compliance with this Agreement (including any applicable Order Form) and the User Documentation, (b) be responsible for the accuracy, quality and legality of School Account Information, and the means by which School acquires School Account Information, Activity Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, and Log and Cookie Information and School’s use of any such information, (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Offerings, and notify us promptly of any such unauthorized access or use, (d) use the Offerings only in accordance with this Agreement, User Documentation, and all Applicable Law, and (e) comply with the terms of service of any Integration Offering with which School use an Offering. Any use of an Offering in breach of the foregoing by School or any Authorized User that in our judgment threatens the security, integrity, or availability of an Offering may result in immediate suspension of access to any or all Offerings.

School acknowledges that it is solely responsible for compliance with any legal or policy obligations related to the protection of the well-being of its students and that it understands that certain Offerings are only intended to be a tool to assist School as part of a broader program intended to fulfill any legal or policy obligations, to the extent applicable. For example, the Liminex Parties make no representation or warranty that any of the GoGuardian Offerings, alone or in combination with any other efforts, will be effective in detecting or stopping suicide, violence to self or others, or any other kind of risky behavior by a student of School or any other individual. We are not responsible for, and School expressly waives any claim for liability against the Liminex Parties related to, any student or other individual’s death, illness, bodily injury, disability, emotional distress or other outcome. To the maximum extent permissible by law, such waiver shall extend to any School personnel, student, student family, estate or other third parties. To the extent that any Liminex Party is made a party to any dispute related to any such death, illness, bodily injury, disability, or other outcome, School shall indemnify us in accordance with Section 13, below.

### 3.3 General Acceptable Use Policy

We need your help to ensure that the Offerings are used safely and appropriately. You agree, represent and warrant that you and your Authorized Users will not use any Offering:

* On any computers and/or accounts on which you do not have permission to operate and on which the Offerings cannot be legally and rightfully operated.
* To do anything, including posting or otherwise communicating any information that is abusive, harmful, threatening, harassing, libelous, bullying, stalking, or otherwise objectionable.
* To do anything unlawful, deceptive, misleading, illegal, unethical, malicious, or discriminatory.
* To intentionally violate another person’s privacy rights under Applicable Law.
* For commercial purposes (beyond School’s internal business purposes).
* To do anything to burden, compromise, or interfere with any Offering, its appearances, security, or functionality.
* In any way that jeopardizes the security of your or any other party’s account.
* To advertise, solicit, or transmit commercial advertisements, including without limitation, junk e-mail, spam, or any other unsolicited messages regardless of the medium (e.g., email, text, SMS, chat, etc.).

School is responsible for any failure by any Authorized User to comply with this General Acceptable Use Policy.

4\. Special Terms for Free, Trial and Beta Offerings
----------------------------------------------------

i. _This Section explains that we may make free, trial, or beta offerings available for you to test and provide us with Feedback about whether an Offering meets your needs. Because these Offerings are different from paid Subscriptions, there are special terms for them._

### 4.1 Free or Trial Subscriptions

If we make an Offering available to you on a free or trial basis, it is so you can use the Offering before purchasing a Subscription to determine if it meets your needs. Trial subscriptions to an Offering shall be subject in all respects to the terms of this Agreement, except that to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, we (a) may discontinue the Offering or your ability to use it at any time, with or without notice and without any further obligations to you; (b) provide the Offering to you solely “AS IS” without any warranties of any kind; and (c) will have no liability for any harm or damages suffered by you or any third party in connection with the use or inability to use the Offering during the trial period.

### 4.2 Beta Offerings

We sometimes make new Offerings or features within existing Offerings available on a beta basis (“Beta Offerings”). Beta Offerings are generally prerelease or untested products or features. Features or offerings labeled as “alpha,” “beta,” or “test” within the interface of an Offering are beta Offerings subject to this Section. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by us, any Offering or feature provided as a beta Offering shall be subject in all respects to the terms of this Agreement, except that to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, we (a) may discontinue the beta Offering or feature or your ability to use it at any time, with or without notice and without any further obligations to you (though we, of course, will endeavor to provide notice of any such disabling whenever reasonably practicable under the circumstances); (b) provide the beta Offering or feature to you solely “AS IS” without any warranties of any kind; and (c) will have no liability for any harm or damages suffered by you or any third party in connection with the use or inability to use the beta Offering or feature during the beta period. Additionally, as consideration for access to and use of any beta Offering, you agree to (1) treat the beta Offering as our Confidential Information; and (2) provide regular Feedback about the beta Offering, if requested.

5\. Term, Termination
---------------------

i. _This Section explains the duration of this Agreement as well as your and our’ obligations after this Agreement ends._

### 5.1 Term

Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Term commences on the Effective Date and continues until all of your Order Forms and Subscription Terms expire.

### 5.2 Termination

Either party may terminate this Agreement (a) if the other party is in material breach of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after its receipt of notice thereof, or (b) upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the other party. School shall continue to be responsible for all Fees for the terminated Subscription Term and other Fees agreed to in the Order Form except to the extent School terminates this Agreement as a result of our uncured material breach or we terminate this Agreement without cause (i.e., not as a result of School’s uncured material breach), in which cases School shall not be obligated to pay for (and shall be entitled to a refund by us of) the Fees allocable to the unused portion of the Subscription Term.

### 5.3 Effect of Termination or Expiration

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, you will have no rights to continue use of (or to provide your Authorized Users with access to) the Offerings or User Documentation, and you immediately will cease accessing and/or using the Offerings and User Documentation, including by, where applicable, erasing and/or uninstalling all downloaded or copied versions of any Offerings and User Documentation, and returning to us or destroying any accompanying User Documentation in your possession or control. The following will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: Sections 1.2, 1.3 (for Fees incurred during the Term), 2.3, 3 (except as otherwise set forth therein), 5.2, 5.3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.

6\. Intellectual Property
-------------------------

i. _This Section explains that we ask that you please protect our and others’ intellectual property._

### 6.1 Ownership

We or our Affiliates (or their licensors) own all right, title and interest in and to the Offerings (including, but not limited to, all photographs, animations, statistics, graphics, text, and any other materials contained therein), the Liminex Information, including, without limitation, all intellectual property rights therein. Subject to the limited rights expressly granted to you under this Agreement, we and our Affiliates reserve all rights, title and interest in and to the Offerings and the Liminex Information, including, without limitation, all related intellectual property rights. The service marks, logos and product and service names of Liminex and its Affiliates (the “Liminex Marks”) are owned by Liminex and our Affiliates. You agree not to display or use any Liminex Marks in any manner without our prior written permission. Any trademarks, service marks and logos associated with an Integration Offering may be the property of the third party provider, and you should consult with their trademark guidelines before using any of their marks.

### 6.2 Feedback

Any and all of your feedback about us or the Offerings, such as suggestions, whether made by you or any of your Authorized Users, for corrections, updates, alterations, changes, or modifications to the Offerings (“Feedback”) will be our property and you hereby assign any rights in such Feedback to us, without payment to you.

### 6.3 Protection of Our Rights

You agree to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and any provider of an Integration Offering you access in connection with an Account, and notify us of any unauthorized access or use of the Offerings or Integration Offerings of which you become aware.

7\. Confidentiality
-------------------

i. _This Section explains that each party must respect each other’s Confidential Information._

As a reminder, our [**Product Privacy Policy**](https://www.goguardian.com/productPrivacy.html) explains our commitment to protecting School Account Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, Activity Information and/or Log and Cookie Information, and nothing in this Section 7 limits the parties’ respective rights or obligations under the [**Product Privacy Policy**](https://www.goguardian.com/productPrivacy.html) or Section 8, below. A party will not disclose or use any Confidential Information of the other party except: (a) as reasonably necessary to perform its obligations or exercise any rights granted pursuant to this Agreement; (b) with the other party’s prior written permission; or (c) to the extent required by law or order of a court or other governmental authority or regulation. Each party agrees to protect the other party’s Confidential Information in the same manner that it protects its own Confidential Information of like kind, but in no event using less than a commercially reasonable standard of care consistent with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding any exceptions in the definition of Confidential Information, the parties agree to treat all Education Records as Confidential Information and disclosure thereof is allowed only to the extent permitted under FERPA.

8\. Privacy and Data
--------------------

i. _This Section explains that the parties each have responsibilities to help protect the privacy of data ingested or maintained in the Offerings. The_ [**_Product Privacy Policy_**](https://www.goguardian.com/productPrivacy.html) _explains, in more detail, how we protect information._

### 8.1 Our Privacy Responsibilities

Our [**Product Privacy Policy**](https://www.goguardian.com/productPrivacy.html), incorporated herein by reference, explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard School Account Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, Activity Information and/or School Log and Cookie Information accessed, recorded and collected through the Offerings, including any free, trial or beta Offerings. We rely on consent obtained from School, acting as an agent of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of School’s students, as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) for using Offerings in connection with students under thirteen (13) years of age, if any, through a COPPA Notice and Disclosure Form we provide to you. For transparency and informational purposes, we also distribute this COPPA Notice and Disclosure Form to Subscription purchasing Schools with children of all ages, including ones who do not have students under thirteen (13) years of age. To the extent School is located in the European Union (“EU”), European Economic Area (“EEA”), or Switzerland, our [**Data Processing Addendum**](https://www.goguardian.com/dpa.html) also applies to your use of the Offerings. School hereby authorizes us to use School Account Information in accordance with this Agreement, the [**Product Privacy Policy**](https://www.goguardian.com/productPrivacy.html) and, to the extent applicable, the [**Data Processing Addendum**](https://www.goguardian.com/dpa.html).

You are solely responsible for notifying the appropriate individuals about the existence of any Offerings on the Managed Devices or Accounts they use and/or in connection with their accounts associated with School’s Account and obtaining any required consent from such individuals in accordance with Applicable Law. Even if not required by Applicable Law, we recommend that you notify all users of Managed Devices or Accounts and their respective parents/guardians, teachers, and other appropriate staff about your use of Offerings. More specifically, we recommend that you provide such persons with a copy of our [**Product Privacy Policy**](https://www.goguardian.com/productPrivacy.html), our COPPA Notice and Disclosure Form, and with respect to GoGuardian Offerings, GoGuardian’s form Parental Letter, and any other parental information made available by us.

### 8.3 Educational Records; FERPA

Where School is located in the United States and to the extent we collect, through the provision or maintenance of any Offerings, any information that constitutes an Education Record, the parties agree that we are acting as a “school official” with “legitimate educational interests” in School’s students’ Education Records under FERPA, or if applicable, is acting under another applicable FERPA exception listed in under FERPA regulation 34 C.F.R. § 99.31(a)(1), such as the “directory information” exception. School acknowledges and agrees that we may process School Account Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, Activity Information and/or School Log and Cookie Information for the purpose of providing the Offerings and related functions. Our [**Product Privacy Policy**](https://www.goguardian.com/productPrivacy.html) explains how we cooperate with School under FERPA to fulfill Education Records requests directed from School (or through School from parents/guardians or eligible students). School represents and warrants that it is authorized to process such information, including any Education Records contained therein, and make such information available to us as set out in this Agreement and the [**Product Privacy Policy**](https://www.goguardian.com/productPrivacy.html).

### 8.4 Data-Related Disputes

School acknowledges and agrees that we have no obligation to resolve or intervene in such disputes.

### 8.5 Disclosure of School Information

You acknowledge, consent, and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your School Account Information, Personal Student Information and Parent/Guardian Information, Activity Information and/or School Log and Cookie Information if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) to enforce this Agreement or the [**Product Privacy Policy**](https://www.goguardian.com/productPrivacy.html); (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our users, and/or the public.

9\. Alerts and Notifications
----------------------------

**This section applies to the GoGuardian Offerings only.**

i. _This Section explains that some GoGuardian Offerings are designed to generate alerts and/or have other notification features, and that, through your settings, you have some ability to control whether to receive certain alerts and/or notifications. It is important for you to understand these features and settings, and to review alerts and notifications carefully and promptly so that you can properly intervene to help students stay safe._

Some GoGuardian Offerings contain features that generate alerts and/or notifications for School or a designated Authorized User’s review and attention related to a user’s activity through a Managed Device or Account. These alerts and notifications are tools designed to help you support and protect the wellbeing of your students and school community. If you receive an alert and/or gain access to any information that triggers a legal obligation, such as a reporting or intervention duty for you (including, for an example, an alert from a GoGuardian Offering that one of your students is potentially at risk of suicide), it is your sole responsibility to fulfill that legal obligation and take any additional, responsible actions necessary to safeguard the students in compliance with Applicable Law. In addition, to the extent you elect not to receive one or more types of alerts and/or notifications in your settings, you are solely responsible for that decision. Unless otherwise specified in the Supplemental Terms, we do not review alerts generated through any of the Offerings or take any action based on these alerts or review your settings.

Your escalation and notification list for such alert and/or notification feature in your account for a particular GoGuardian Offering may change from time to time, including because contact information changes (e.g., changes in School Profile Information, its Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information and Parent/Guardian Information (e.g., contact information, including an Authorized User’s email address, or changes in Parent/Guardian Information ), and Association Information, including, for example, the relationship of an Authorized School Personnel or a guardian/parent to a child/student changes (e.g., change in guardianship or educational rights holder). Without limiting the generality of Section 1.2.1, it is important that you maintain accurate and up-to-date Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, and Association Information to ensure the appropriateness and timeliness of any alerts and notifications generated through a GoGuardian Offering. It is also important that you remind parents/guardians to update School of any changes, including contact information and guardianship.

Additionally, without limiting the generality of the other terms of this Agreement, if your School uses GoGuardian Beacon or GoGuardian Admin (the Beacon starter function), your School represents and warrants that your School: (1) is solely responsible for having, to the extent legally required, an up-to-date and easily available suicide prevention policy; (2) is solely responsible for having, to the extent legally required, a necessary suicide prevention program; and (3) your School will notify parents/guardians about your School’s adoption of GoGuardian Beacon and educate them about suicide prevention (including, suicide risk factors, warning signs, and resources) before enabling the Guardian Notification feature (or similar functionality) of GoGuardian Beacon or GoGuardian Admin (the self harm smart alerts or Beacon starter function).

Further, GoGuardian Beacon sends SMS messages to users who have opted-in to receive text messages for certain alerts as described above. Only those notifications which have been enabled in the "Staff Notifications" section of the "Alert Preferences" will be sent. If you have any questions regarding privacy, please read our [Product Privacy Policy](https://www.goguardian.com/policies/product-privacy). You can cancel the SMS service at any time through your GoGuardian Beacon settings. Please navigate to “Your Beacon Profile” under “Settings”, un-check “Text Message” under “Notifications Format”, and save changes. After this, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. To join again, sign up as you did the first time and GoGuardian Beacon will begin sending SMS messages to you again. If you experience issues with GoGuardian Beacon notifications you can get help directly at [support@goguardian.com](mailto:support@goguardian.com) or [https://help.goguardian.com](https://help.goguardian.com/). Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. Message and data rates may apply for any messages sent to you from GoGuardian. Message frequency is recurring and depends on your GoGuardian Beacon settings, and whether an alert is triggered. Contact your wireless provider with any questions about your text or data plan.

12\. Warranties, Disclaimer, and Release
----------------------------------------

i. _This Section explains that we strive to provide you with our Offerings with a certain level of skill and care, but we cannot promise that our Offerings are perfect._

We provide the Offerings using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care, but we cannot make guarantees about the operation, use or results achieved through the use of the Offerings. ACCORDINGLY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OFFERING IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND SCHOOL’S USE IS AT ITS SOLE RISK. THE ENTIRE RISK OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE RESIDES WITH SCHOOL. THE LIMINEX PARTIES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE LIMINEX PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT ANY OFFERINGS WILL MEET SCHOOL’S REQUIREMENTS, WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS, OR WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE, COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR SAFE. SCHOOL IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SCHOOL ACCOUNT INFORMATION, THE MEANS BY WHICH SCHOOL ACQUIRES SCHOOL ACCOUNT INFORMATION, ACTIVITY INFORMATION, PERSONAL STUDENT INFORMATION, PARENT/GUARDIAN INFORMATION, AND SCHOOL LOG AND COOKIE INFORMATION, AND ALL COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS BASED ON THE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ANY AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED ALERTS THAT SCHOOL MAY RECEIVE. WE ARE NOT A MEDICAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. SCHOOL UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT LIMINEX AND THE OTHER LIMINEX PARTIES ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION OTHER THAN TO PROVIDE THE OFFERINGS TO SCHOOL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

SCHOOL HEREBY RELEASES EACH OF THE LIMINEX PARTIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS IN RIGHTS FROM ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES, AND DEMANDS OF EVERY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO ANY CLAIMS MADE BY SCHOOL, ANY AUTHORIZED USER, ANY USER OF A MANAGED DEVICE OR ACCOUNT OR THEIR FAMILIES. IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OFFERING, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FIRST USE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND/OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO SCHOOL. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCLUDES, RESTRICTS OR MODIFIES ANY GUARANTEE, WARRANTY, TERM OR CONDITION, RIGHT OR REMEDY IMPLIED OR IMPOSED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT LAWFULLY BE EXCLUDED, RESTRICTED OR MODIFIED.

THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT. SCHOOL AGREES THAT OUR LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO SCHOOL.

THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US AND YOU.

15\. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
-----------------------------------------

### 15.1 Governing Law and Venue

This Agreement and any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement are governed by the laws of the state of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You further agree to accept service of process by mail. To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in court, the parties consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the courts located in Los Angeles County, California. If School is a United States public and accredited educational institution, domiciled in a state within the United States that expressly requires a different choice of law other than California law, then School’s state’s law will apply. If School is a United States public and accredited educational institution domiciled in a state within the United States that expressly requires venue or jurisdiction of a different state, then School’s state’s required venue and jurisdiction will apply.

### 15.2 Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver (“Arbitration Agreement”)

In the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Offering, any person’s access to and/or use of the Offering, and/or the provision of content, features, and/or technology on or through the Offering (collectively, “Claims”), the parties must first give the other notice of the Claim. This notice must include a brief written statement with the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, as well as the facts giving rise to the Claim and the relief requested. You must send any such notice to Liminex by email to legal@goguardian.com AND by U.S. Mail to Liminex, 2030 E Maple Ave Suite 100, El Segundo, CA 90245.

After thirty (30) days, you or we may resort to the other alternatives described in Section 15.2.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice requirement in this section and the 30-day negotiation period required shall not apply to Claims involving patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, trade secrets or piracy or unauthorized use of an Offering.

#### 15.2.1 

**Binding Arbitration.** _Arbitration Rules and Forum_ Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any Claims between you and us, if unresolved through informal consultation and negotiation pursuant to the preceding paragraph, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in Los Angeles, California. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if School is a United States public and accredited educational institution domiciled in a state within the United States that expressly requires a different location for arbitration other than Los Angeles, California, then School’s state’s required location for binding arbitration will apply. If School that is a United States public and accredited educational institution and your consent to binding arbitration is expressly prohibited by the laws of the state within the United States in which School’s educational institution is domiciled, then this Section is hereby waived. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (collectively, “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Agreement, and administered by JAMS. The JAMS Rules and fee information are available at www.jamsadr.org or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of each party. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.

_Exceptions: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims_  concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and Claims of piracy or unauthorized use of any Offering shall not be subject to arbitration under this Section 15.2.1. In addition, the parties may choose to pursue a Claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over the parties otherwise qualify for such small claims court and where the Claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.

_Batch Arbitration:_ Notwithstanding this Section 15.2.1, to increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Liminex agree that, in the event there are ten (10) or more individual Claims of a substantially similar nature (i.e., Claims that arise out of or relate to the same or similar facts and raise the same or similar legal issues and requests for relief) filed against Liminex by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a ninety (90) day period, JAMS shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Claims per batch (or, if between ten (10) and ninety-nine (99) individual Disputes are filed, a single batch of all those Claims, and, to the extent there are less than 100 Claims remaining after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Claims); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”). If there is any dispute about the applicability of these Batch Arbitration procedures, JAMS shall appoint a single administrative arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process.

_Authority of Arbitrator:_ In binding arbitration, the arbitrator shall have the authority (a) to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Claim; (b) to award monetary damages; and (c) to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under Applicable Law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

_Confidentiality:_ All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. Both parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent either party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

#### 15.2.2 

**Class Action Waiver.** THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. The parties are instead electing that all Claims not otherwise resolved informally as permitted above shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
