Terms of Use
============

Last Updated: April 24th, 2024

Welcome to QuestionPro, Inc. (“QuestionPro,” “we,” “us,” “our”) and thank you for using our products and services (“Services”). The following Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”) govern all use of the Services, so please read carefully.

1\. ACCEPTANCE

The Services are offered subject to your acceptance of these Terms, our [Privacy Policy](https://www.questionpro.com/help/privacy-policy.html), and any additional terms and policies (including operating rules, guidelines and procedures) that may apply depending on your particular use of the Services. (For example, if you use our Rewards feature, the [QuestionPro Promotion Terms and Conditions](https://www.questionpro.com/rewards/termsConditions.html) apply.)

By using the Services or by clicking on an acceptance box for these Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and all other applicable terms and policies. If you do not agree with these Terms and policies, do not use or access the Services or click on the acceptance box.

If you will be using the Services on behalf of a company or any other entity, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that entity and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, “you” and “your” will refer to that entity. Additionally, since the Services are available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and take full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services. These Terms are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.

2\. REGISTRATION

In order to use certain features of the Services, you may be required to register for a Services account. You warrant that any registration information (such as name, contact information, or other information) you submit to QuestionPro is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and you agree to keep such information up to date. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of these Terms and may result in immediate termination of your account. To the extent you are able to select a “user name,” you may not (i) select or use a username that is a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use a username that is a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use a username that is offensive, vulgar, obscene, or unlawful. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel or refuse registration of any user name we believe violates these Terms, our policies, or the law. You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and other account information. Your login must only be used by one person; a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. QuestionPro is not liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this Section 2. We may use your registration information and any technical information about your use of the Services to tailor its presentations to you, facilitate your movement through the Services, communicate separately with you or publish the fact that you are a user of our services.

3\. YOUR CONTENT.

As between you and QuestionPro, you retain ownership of the intellectual property rights of the content you submit to us or the Services (“Your Content”), except for the limited rights that enable us to perform the Services. In short, what’s yours is yours, but we do need certain permissions from you so that our processing, maintenance, storage, technical reproduction, back-up, distribution, and related handling of Your Content does not infringe applicable copyright and other laws. Therefore, in order to perform the Services, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, and irrevocable (for so long as Your Content is stored with us) license to use, reproduce, and display Your Content as reasonably necessary to provide you with the Services. You are responsible for maintaining, protecting, and making backups of Your Content. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be liable for the loss or corruption of Your Content.

4\. OUR CONTENT.

Using the Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Services. You agree that all QuestionPro content and materials delivered via the Services or otherwise made available by QuestionPro (collectively, “Our Content”) are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly authorized by QuestionPro in writing, you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit, or create derivative works of Our Content. However, you may print or download a reasonable number of copies of Our Content for your own informational purposes; provided, that you retain all copyright and other proprietary notices within the copies. Reproducing, copying, or distributing any of Our Content or QuestionPro design elements for any other purpose is strictly prohibited without our express prior written permission. Use of Our Content for any purpose not expressly permitted in these Terms is prohibited. QuestionPro reserves any rights not expressly granted in these Terms.

5\. USE OF THE SERVICES.

You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Services will comply with all laws and regulations; (ii) Your Content will not infringe or violate any third-party intellectual property rights or any laws or regulations (including, without limitation, obscenity, defamation, and privacy laws); (iii) if you use the Services on behalf of any third party, you have all necessary authorizations; and (iv) your use of the Services will not conflict with any obligations you have to any third party. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to remove, modify, prevent access to, or refuse to display Your Content that we believe violates these Terms, our policies, or the law.

If you are a paying user of the Services, you shall pay QuestionPro Service fees in accordance with this Section 6 and our pricing policy located at www.QuestionPro.com/pricing (“Fees”). You will be billed for your first subscription term immediately upon upgrading to a paid subscription. Subscriptions will automatically renew for a period equal in length to the preceding subscription period. All Fees will be invoiced in advance (on an annual basis depending upon the subscription you purchase), and the credit card last used by you for a QuestionPro transaction will automatically be charged at the start of each subscription period. All Fees are non-refundable—without limitation, we shall provide no refunds or credits for partial months of Service, for upgrades or downgrades, or for unused months of an annual account. For any subscription upgrade, the credit card last used by you for a QuestionPro transaction will automatically be charged the new Fee on your next billing cycle.

In the event of a downgrade of a commercial license to a QuestionPro Free user account or a lower license level previously used functionalities only available to the higher license level will be removed and limited to the basic functions of the lower License. Full access to the survey data may, in the case of earlier use of functions from the higher license, will not be available. In order to get access again, it is possible to upgrade the license at any time.

8\. CHANGES TO THE TERMS

We may amend these Terms from time to time by posting an amended version in the Services and on our website. If you are a Free Account user, the amended version will become effective immediately as of the amended version’s Notice Date. If you are a new or returning user who registers for services on or after the Notice Date, the amended version will be effective immediately. If you are a current paying user of the Services, these Terms will continue under their original provisions for your original subscriptions, and the amended version will become effective at the start of your next QuestionPro subscription period (including any new subscription or any automatically renewed subscription). Your use of the Services after an amended version becomes effective will confirm your acceptance and consent of that amended version. It is your responsibility to check the Services or our website (regularly, if a Free Account user, or prior to the start of your next QuestionPro subscription period, if any other user) for amended versions of these Terms and to review any changes. These Terms may not be amended in any other way except through a written agreement executed by both you and an authorized representative of QuestionPro. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may amend our Privacy Policy or all other auxiliary policies at any time by posting amended versions on our website; the amended versions will become effective immediately upon posting.

9\. CHANGES TO SERVICES

QuestionPro is constantly innovating and evolving the Services in order to provide the best possible experience for our users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without notice. Changes to the form and nature of the Services may include, without limitation, the alteration or removal of a functionality or aspect of the Services.

10\. ANTI-SPAM AND EMAIL POLICY.

QuestionPro expressly forbids all SPAM (the term "SPAM" meaning the sending of unsolicited email to parties unknown to the sender). If you are found to be using the Services for SPAM, your account will be subject to immediate termination. The Services may only be used in connection with email lists for which recipients have voluntarily registered. Using the Services to send email to an address you obtain without the consent of the addressee is a violation of these Terms. You are prohibited from importing email addresses for persons who have not affirmatively and clearly elected to receive your mailings. For clarity, you will only send email to persons who have willingly signed up to receive your mailings. If we receive complaints about your activities under this Section 9, your account may be subject to immediate termination. You will not send email under any company or organization name other than your own company/organization, and you will not send email with fraudulent or misleading header or source information. All email sent through the Services must be expressly for the purpose of collecting data using QuestionPro’s online surveys. Sending email through the Services to solicit any actions other than completing QuestionPro surveys is a violation of these Terms. You are fully responsible for the contents of your messages and the consequences of any such messages. We shall have no responsibility or liability for messages or other content that is created by you. You shall not send, post, distribute or disseminate any defamatory, obscene, or otherwise unlawful messages, material or information, including another person's proprietary information (including trademarks, trade secrets, or copyrighted information) without express authorization from the rights holder. QuestionPro will cooperate with legal authorities in releasing names and IP addresses of users who are involved in SPAM or illegal activities.

11\. OTHER RESTRICTIONS

* You shall not attempt to gain unauthorized access (i) to any portion or feature of the Services, (ii) to any systems or networks connected to the Services, (iii) to any QuestionPro server, or (iv) to any of the services offered on or through the Services, by hacking, password “mining”, or any other illegitimate means.
* You shall not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Services or any network connected to the Services, nor breach the security or authentication measures on the Services or any network connected to the Services. You shall not reverse look-up, trace, or seek to trace any information on any other user of or visitor to the Services or any other customer of QuestionPro, or exploit the Services or any service or information made available or offered by or through the Services.

12\. SERVICE LEVELS

The following services levels and this Section 12 apply to you only if you are an Enterprise Client user:

* If you are a paying user, are not in breach of this Agreement, and are not delinquent with respect to any Fees, QuestionPro will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available to you with an Uptime Percentage (defined below) of at least 99.5% during the course of the Uptime Calculation Period (defined below). Our calculation of uptime shall be definitive and final. In the event we determine that we did not meet the uptime commitment, as your sole remedy and QuestionPro’s exclusive liability, you will be eligible to receive a credit for an additional month of Services.
* "Unavailable" means that your Services have no external connectivity during a 5-minute period.
* "Uptime Percentage" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of 5-minute periods during the Uptime Calculation Period that the Services were in an Unavailable state, excluding downtime resulting directly or indirectly from Service Level Exclusions.
* "Service Level Exclusions" are downtimes that shall not be deducted when calculating an Uptime Percentage; the Service Level Exclusions are as follows: (i) downtime caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of QuestionPro servers; (ii) downtime that results from any actions or inactions by you or any third party; (iii) downtime as a result of regular maintenance or patch builds; (iv) downtime as a result of significant upgrades or significant maintenance to QuestionPro software for which we have given notice; (v) downtime arising from our suspension and termination of your right to use the Services in accordance with these Terms or our policies.
* "Uptime Calculation Period" is the 365-day period immediately preceding the date you make a confirmed claim via email to your account manager. If you have been using the Services for less than 365 days, the Uptime Calculation Period will still be deemed the preceding 365 days, but any days prior to you becoming a paying user will be deemed to have had 100% availability. Any downtime occurring prior to a successful service credit claim cannot be used for future claims.
* Any claim must be received by your account manager within 30 days after a complaint of Unavailability incident. The claim must include (i) the text "SLA CLAIM" in the subject line, (ii) the dates and times of each Unavailability incident being claimed, and (iii) logs or documentation that corroborate your claimed Unavailability incidents.

13\. THIRD PARTY SITES

The Services may allow you to link to other websites or resources on the Internet, and other websites or resources may contain links to the QuestionPro website and our Services. These other websites are not under our control, and you acknowledge that QuestionPro is not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of these websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply endorsement by QuestionPro. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, goods, information, or services available on or through any such website or resource.

14\. USE OF AI

This section and the specific levels outlined below are applicable to users utilizing QuestionPro AI services:

* AI-Enhanced Survey Design and Analysis: QuestionPro utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to assist clients in building sophisticated surveys, dashboards, and performing sentiment analysis. Our AI tools recommend survey structures, question types, and analysis models based on the industry and specific objectives of the client.
* Data Usage and Training: The AI system continuously improves by analyzing aggregated data from surveys and responses. Data is anonymized and used solely to enhance the AI's understanding and prediction capabilities. This process helps in refining our AI models to offer more accurate suggestions and analytics to all users, without directly sharing or applying one client's specific data insights to another's projects.
* Confidentiality and Data Protection: All data used to train our AI models is subject to strict confidentiality and data protection policies, ensuring compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. Clients retain ownership of their data, and QuestionPro commits to using such data only to deliver and improve the services offered.
* AI Services Disclaimer: While QuestionPro's AI services aim to provide valuable insights and efficiencies, decisions based on AI recommendations are the sole responsibility of the client. QuestionPro does not guarantee the accuracy of AI-generated content or its applicability to specific client needs.
* AI Service-Specific Restrictions: Use of QuestionPro's AI services is subject to certain restrictions, including prohibitions on reverse engineering, unauthorized access, and the use of AI for competitive benchmarking or development of similar services.

15\. INDEMNIFICATION

Client will indemnify and hold QuestionPro harmless from and against all claims, demands, actions, settlements, judgments, damages, losses, liabilities, cost and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or related to any Client Content submitted to, posted to, or transmitted via, the Service by Client or any of its end users (including any Client Content that infringes the rights of any third party or otherwise violates any laws or regulations); provided that, QuestionPro provides Client with (i) prompt written notice of all claims and threats thereof, (ii) sole control of all defense and settlement activities and (iii) all reasonably requested assistance with respect thereto. Client will not be responsible for any settlements if they are not pre approved in writing.

QuestionPro will defend, indemnify, and hold Client harmless from and against all third-party claims (and all resulting damages awarded to third parties, and costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from infringement by the Service of any third-party U.S. patent, copyright or trademark; provided that, Client provides QuestionPro with (iv) prompt written notice of all claims and threats thereof, (v) sole control of all defense and settlement activities and (vi) all reasonably requested assistance with respect thereto.

18\. TERMINATION BY YOU

Subject to earlier termination as provided below, this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for the initial subscription period specified in the applicable SOW; thereafter this Agreement will automatically renew for consecutive periods each equal in length to the initial subscription period (unless either party provides the other party with written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then current period). Any current Statement of Work (or order form) governed by this Agreement will automatically extend for successive twelve month terms of service immediately following the current term if not terminated in writing between the Parties not less than thirty days prior to the end of the service period defined in that Statement of work or order form. Such renewal will be re-priced at an annual increase of thirteen point six percent (13.6%) to reflect a US CPI increase and increased cost of service. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days (ten (10) days in the case of non-payment) from receipt of written notice thereof. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights granted herein to Client will terminate and Client will make no further use of the Service.

The above statement is only applicable for our Free, Essentials, Professional, Advanced, Corporate, Team Edition, and Research Edition plans.

19\. TERMINATION BY US

We may restrict, suspend, or terminate the Services to you (i) if you fail to comply with these Terms or our policies (including without limitation, failure to pay any fees owed by you in relation to the Services) (ii) if you use the Services in a way that creates or could create liability for us, (iii) if you interfere with other’s use of the Services, (iv) if a law enforcement, judicial body, or other government agency requests us to do so, or (v) if we need to investigate suspected misconduct by you, (vi) if you exceed the maximum number of responses allowed per minute based on the restrictions on your license level. Any such restriction, suspension, or termination shall be made by us in our sole discretion, and we will not be responsible to you or any third party for any damages that may result or arise out of such restriction, suspension, or termination of your account and/or access to the Services. In the event of an urgent matter, we reserve the right to take immediate action without notice. Additionally, unless you are a paying user, we reserve the right to terminate and delete your account if you have not accessed the Services for a period of 365 days or longer.

21\. EXPORT AND TRADE CONTROLS.

You agree not to import, export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any part of the Services or any information provided on or through the Services except in full compliance with all United States, foreign and other applicable laws and regulations.

You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. Electronic communications may be in the form of emails sent by us to the email address associated with your account or communications posted by us on the QuestionPro website, your “My Account” page, or the Services you utilize. We save all communication (chats, emails, and calls) between QuestionPro representatives and you for record-keeping, training and quality-assurance purposes.

All notices to QuestionPro must be addressed in writing to: QuestionPro, Inc., 9450 SW Gemini Dr #62790, Beaverton, OR 97008-7105, USA. QuestionPro may provide notices to you via the email address associated with your account or through your Services account.

23\. RESOLVING DISPUTES

We want to ensure that you have an excellent experience with QuestionPro. If you have a problem or concern, we encourage you to first contact your account manager or Live Chat support to try to resolve any issues. However, in the event of formal proceedings, you and QuestionPro agree that these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Washington, as if made within Washington between two Washington residents, and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts located in King County, Washington. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (but without limiting either party’s right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief immediately, at any time, in any court of competent jurisdiction), any disputes arising with respect to these Terms shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”). The arbitrator shall be selected by joint agreement of the parties. In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating party providing the other party with written notice that it plans to seek arbitration, an arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS in accordance with its rules. The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and enforceable in any court. The arbitration proceeding shall take place in San Francisco, California, using the English language.

YOU ALSO AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND AGREE NOT TO BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED.

If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue provisions above, then those provisions do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).

24\. CONFIDENTIALITY

During the term of this Agreement, each party (a "Disclosing Party") may provide the other party (a "Receiving Party") with confidential and/or proprietary materials and information ("Confidential Information"). All materials and information provided by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party and identified at the time of disclosure as “Confidential” or bearing a similar legend, and all other information that the Receiving Party reasonably should have known was the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, shall be considered Confidential Information; for the avoidance of doubt, the Service and terms of this Agreement are Confidential Information of QuestionPro. Receiving Party shall maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and will not disclose such information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party will only use the Confidential Information internally for the purposes contemplated hereunder. The obligations in this Section 4 shall not apply to any information that: (i) is made generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement, (ii) is developed by the Receiving Party independently from the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, (iii) is disclosed to Receiving Party by a third party without restriction, or (iv) was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession prior to the disclosure to the Receiving Party and was not obtained by the Receiving Party either directly or indirectly from the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information as required by law or court order; provided that, Receiving Party provides Disclosing Party with prompt written notice thereof and uses its best efforts to limit disclosure. At any time, upon Disclosing Party’s request, Receiving Party shall return to Disclosing Party all Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in its possession, including, without limitation, all copies and extracts thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to any third-party to the limited extent necessary to exercise its rights, or perform its obligations, under this Agreement; provided that, all such third parties are bound in writing by obligations of confidentiality and non-use at least as protective of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as this Agreement.

25\. NON-SOLICITATION

Until one (1) year after termination of the Agreement, Client will not encourage or solicit any employee or consultant of QuestionPro to leave QuestionPro for any reason.

26\. MISCELLANEOUS

The failure of either party to exercise or enforce any right contained in these Terms, is not a waiver of either parties’ right to do so later. QuestionPro shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations in these Terms where such failure results from any cause beyond QuestionPro’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms are not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you, except with our prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and their rights and obligations without consent. Both parties agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind QuestionPro in any respect whatsoever.
