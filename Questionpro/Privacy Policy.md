This Privacy Statement describes how QuestionPro collects and uses the personal information you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.

QuestionPro strives to conform its privacy practices, policies and/or procedures with any and all applicable international, country-specific, US Federal, state, and/or local laws, codes, regulations, and requirements, and the industry codes, standards, and regulations of various market and opinion research professional associations and/or organizations, including, without limitation, the ICC/ESOMAR International Code on Market and Social Research and the Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO). QuestionPro is committed to protecting the security and integrity of all personal information collected by or disclosed to QuestionPro. QuestionPro will not use any personal information for direct marketing or advertising purposes, and membership as a panel member and/or participation in any survey(s) are completely voluntary. This privacy policy identifies the personal information that QuestionPro collects; how such personal information will be used and protected; and your rights.

INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

Registration

In order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and create a username and password. During registration, you are required to give contact information (including email address). We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.

After registering with the site, we use your email address to provide you with a series of “Ongoing Communications and Product Updates” (see "Communication from the Site"). These communications are used to give you a better understanding of the site, what it offers, and how it is best utilized. As always, you have the option not to receive these types of communications (see “Choice and Opt-out” in "Information Sharing and Disclosure").

By creating an account and providing us with your information, you explicitly consent to the collection, storage, and processing of your personal data.

Orders

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. We will also use this information to send you ‘Service-related Communications’ (see ‘Communication from the Site’). These include email confirmations of billing transactions, account upgrades, and account cancellations. Please see “Contact Us” below.

Profile

We store information that we collect through user input, cookies, log files, and user surveys to create a “profile” of preferences. This profile information includes each of the following categories:

Registration Information: username, password, first name, last name, email address, phone

Order Information: credit card number, credit card expiration, billing address

Preferences: profile information that categorizes how the software is utilized

Details of the user profile are used to contact the user (see “Communication from the Site”) and provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site.

Profile information may be updated at any time by clicking on the “My Account” link while the user is logged into their administrative account.

SURVEYS OR CONTESTS

If you are a member of a QuestionPro research panel, we may from time-to-time provide you with the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and/or username), and demographic information (such as zip code). We use this information gain knowledge about our users and their experience using the site.

FORWARD TO FRIEND/ADD A USER

A respondent may share a survey with other users by providing email addresses after completing the survey. QuestionPro will automatically send a survey link to those addresses and a one-time email that introduces and invites the addressee to the QuestionPro site. We will not share these email addresses with customers or survey administrators and will not send future mailings unless the addressee requests further communication. Any addressee who has been referred to our site or surveys may contact [\[email protected\]](https://www.questionpro.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) (or use the “Contact Us” link on our homepage) and request to be removed from the database. When you add a new user to your account, such as the “Add User” function on your QuestionPro account, we collect that user’s name, email address and other contact information. QuestionPro stores this information for the sole purpose of providing this service to you as our QuestionPro customer. You or the added user may request to delete this submitted information by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.questionpro.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

USES OF INFORMATION

Any information shared with QuestionPro during the creation of a survey is owned solely by the administrator of that survey. By the nature of how our service works, surveys need to be shared via a URL on the Internet. We provide the option to password-protect your surveys if they contain sensitive content. Email addresses uploaded to the system for the purpose of sending survey invitations and email communication are owned solely by the survey administrator. We will never share any information uploaded to the system with any 3rd parties. Data collected through surveys is owned solely by the survey administrator. By default, the data is only accessible by providing a username and password and logging into the site. There is the option to share online reports via a URL from the administrative account. The survey administrator controls this option. We will never use any of the data collected.

The IP address is not collected for the purpose of tracking or monitoring your activity on the Internet. In non-United States jurisdictions, an IP address may be classified as personal information or personal data under applicable laws; therefore, to the extent that QuestionPro collects IP addresses, QuestionPro will collect, use, maintain, secure and/or disclose IP addresses in accordance with applicable Laws.

TESTIMONIALS

We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name.

IMPORT CONTACTS

You can import contacts from your email account address book to invite them to take part in surveys. We collect the username and password for the email account you provide and will only use such information for the purpose of inviting contacts to take part in surveys.

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the survey respondents have a right to access or challenge the processing of their personal data being held and managed by the administrator of the survey. They can exercise these rights by submitting an individual rights request by filling this [form](https://questionpro.com/t/AQkY3Zhhko)

DATA RETENTION

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Retention is defined as the maintenance of data in a production or live environment which can be accessed by an authorized user in the ordinary course of business. For the avoidance of doubt, Data used in staging, development, and testing or draft versions of the Application shall not be retained beyond their active use period nor copied into production or live environments.

After active use has expired and according to appropriate exceptions, Data shall be destroyed. For the purposes of enforcing retention in accordance with this policy each department is responsible for the Data it creates, uses, stores, processes, and destroys.

QuestionPro Inc shall be responsible for enforcing the retention, archiving, and destruction of Data. The Legal Department may issue a litigation hold request to QuestionPro Security and Compliance which requires that data relating to potential or actual litigation, arbitration, or other claims, demands, disputes, or regulatory action be retained in accordance with instructions from the Legal Department.

Each employee shall be responsible for returning Data in their possession or control to QuestionPro upon separation or retirement. The final disposition of such Data shall be determined by the immediate supervisor in accordance with this policy.

The System will store data from your surveys/campaigns/polls as long as your account is current and active. If data is removed (User deleting surveys, responses, questions, answers, campaigns, polls, etc.) the system will remove the data permanently from the primary database servers immediately. The same data will be present in our backup systems for 7 days, after which it will be removed from all our systems. In some cases, if important items (like surveys etc.) are deleted, they may not be removed from our systems immediately. Data may be placed in a recycle bin and permanently removed after 7 days. We will not accommodate requests for restoring data from our backup systems unless it is a system or hardware failure on our part. No Exceptions.

SECURITY

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
