This non-personal information is used for system administration purposes and to improve the Boston Pizza Technology.

Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Boston Pizza Technology. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Boston Pizza Technology (so you do not have to enter information every time), offer personalized page content and information for your use, and otherwise facilitate your Boston Pizza Technology experience. You may choose to decline cookies if your computer or smartphone permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the Boston Pizza Technology.

4\. Advertisement Cookies – Advertisements may be displayed on the Boston Pizza Technology and may contain cookies or other technologies.
