**We collect certain information from cookies that we may send to your computer to try and give you a personalised experience.**

### Web beacons

Our website may contain electronic image requests (called a **single-pixel gif** or **web beacon** request) that allow us to count page views and to access cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page (including an ad banner) can act as a web beacon. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any of your personal information. We merely use them to compile anonymous information about our website.
