This document concerns what data you provide to this website, the purpose of the data, how the data is stored, and how the data can be removed.

### Data you directly provide

Data that you provide to the website for the purpose of the site's operation (for example: an account name, account password, or channel subscription) will be stored in the website's database until the user decides to remove it. This data will not be intentionally shared with anyone or anything.

Information stored about a registered user is limited to:

* a list of session tokens for remaining logged in across devices
* the last time an account was updated (to provide accurate notifications)
* a list of video IDs identifying notifications from a user's subscriptions
* a list of channel UCIDs the user is subscribed to
* a user ID (for persistent storage of subscriptions and preferences)
* a json object containing user preferences
* a hashed password
* a randomly generated token for providing an RSS feed of a user's subscriptions
* a list of video IDs identifying watched videos

Users can clear their watch history using the [clear watch history](https://yewtu.be/clear_watch_history) page.

### Data you passively provide

Information about a request is limited to:

* the time the request was made
* the status code of the response
* the method of the request
* the requested URL
* how long it took to complete the request.

No identifying information is logged, such as the visitor's cookie, user-agent, or IP address. Here are a couple lines to serve as an example:
