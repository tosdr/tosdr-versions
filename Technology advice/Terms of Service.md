**PRODUCT LISTING TERMS AND CONDITIONS** 

TechnologyAdvice provides free product listings for software vendors to encourage crowdsourced reviews and improve the authority of our 87 software categories. While these listings are unbiased, we reserve the right to deny this service to any vendor at our own discretion, based on TechnologyAdvice editorial standards and the expectations of our readers.

Failure to meet one or more of the following requirements may lead to a denial of your product listing:

* **Your product is designed for business use:** We do not offer product listings for consumer-facing technology such as personal mobile apps, social media platforms, budgeting tools, graphic design programs, or consumer hardware. Your software must have a direct application in the business world and primarily target business users.
* **Your product fits into one of our established categories:** If your software does not fit into one of our 87 established software categories, it is not likely a good fit for our audience. The process for building new categories is driven by market demand, not individual sellers.
* **Your product has a clearly discernible purpose and value proposition:** We only list products that offer clearly articulated value for their intended user base (e.g. CRM software for salespeople; bug tracking software for developers).
* **Your product has an up-to-date website:** Part of our due diligence process is to research each vendor online, browse their website, and read their marketing materials. If the state of that website or the information presented therein gives reason to question credibility, we may deny your request.
