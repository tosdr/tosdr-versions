Privacy Statement
-----------------

TechnologyAdvice, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively “TechnologyAdvice”) are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. This privacy policy applies to Your information that TechnologyAdvice collects and receives. By using this website (“Website”) You agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please read the following policy to understand how Your Personal Information will be treated as You use TechnologyAdvice’s Services. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. All capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as defined in TechnologyAdvice’s [Terms of Use](https://technologyadvice.com/terms-conditions/).

Personal Information Defined
----------------------------

For this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information that is personally identifiable such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with a User. TechnologyAdvice collects and uses Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the Users of our Services.

Personal Information TechnologyAdvice Collects
----------------------------------------------

TechnologyAdvice collects Personal Information upon Your consent. This information might be used to send you product recommendations, articles via a newsletter, or more information about a particular technology vendor, depending on the form you fill out and the consent you provide at the time you fill out that form.

Product Recommendations: TechnologyAdvice collects Personal Information from You in order to connect You with sellers of technology (“Services”) that You are searching for. When You give TechnologyAdvice access to Personal Information for this purpose, You consent to receive product recommendations and technology buying advice from TechnologyAdvice via email or phone call, and with your consent the Website may pass your data along to technology vendors who meet your requirements.

Email Newsletters: TechnologyAdvice collects email addresses to provide readers of our blogs with updates via email newsletters. These email newsletters contain links to blog posts, product recommendations, and links to research white papers that match your technology or industry interests.

* Email address
* Name
* Phone number
* Industry
* Company demographics

When You consent to receive pricing details for a technology, TechnologyAdvice will contact you with those pricing details. With your consent, the Website may pass your data along to technology vendors who meet your requirements.

In connection with reviews, posts, and surveys, TechnologyAdvice (and/or its third party service providers) may collect a wide variety of product- and vendor-related information.

Please be aware that while some pieces of information that You provide to TechnologyAdvice would not be sufficient to identify You when seen by another User without any context, the combination of different pieces of information that You have provided for viewing by other Users, or any contextual information, may allow other Users and TechnologyAdvice to identify You.

When You contact TechnologyAdvice by sending TechnologyAdvice an e-mail or when You use any of our contact forms, TechnologyAdvice will collect any information that is contained in (and/or attached to) Your e-mail, text message, or that You enter into such forms.

Legal Grounds for Processing Information under GDPR

Browsing the Website
--------------------

If You browse through the Website without entering any Personal Information, TechnologyAdvice will automatically gather and store certain information about Your visit. This information does not identify You personally and cannot be linked back to You unless You decide at some point to identify Yourself. If You are only browsing, TechnologyAdvice may collect the following information (whenever possible): IP address, domain name, the type of browser and operating system used to access the Website, the date and time You access the Website, the pages You visit (click-through), and if You linked to the Website from another website, the address of that website as well as additional information related to Your visit.

Cookies
-------

TechnologyAdvice may place “cookies” on Your personal computer. “Cookies” are small identifiers sent from a web server and stored on Your computer’s hard drive, similar to a license plate, that help TechnologyAdvice to recognize You if You visit the Website again. TechnologyAdvice use cookies to record session information, such as record user-specific information on what pages You access or visit, record past activity in order to provide better service when You return to the Website, ensure that You are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, to customize Website content based on Your browser type, and to track how You found the Website. Cookies are not designed to be used to get data from Your hard drive, Your e-mail or any other personal data about You.

To protect Your privacy, TechnologyAdvice does not use cookies to store or transmit any Personal Information about You on the Internet. You can reject cookies by changing Your browser settings. Please note, however, that if You reject our cookies, it is possible that some web pages may not properly load, Your access to certain information might be denied or You might have to enter information about Yourself more than once.

TechnologyAdvice does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information by anyone under the age of 18. Do not fill out any forms on the site if You are under the age of 18 and do not provide TechnologyAdvice with any information regarding any individual under the age of 18.

Use of Personal Information
---------------------------

Personal Information You submit to TechnologyAdvice, or to third parties that support us in collecting information, is used by us to provide You and other Users with the Services, to respond to requests that You make, to improve our Services, and to operate, maintain, and improve the features, functionality, performance, and support of the Services.

TechnologyAdvice uses the Personal Information that it gathers about You for the following purposes:

TechnologyAdvice may collect your email address to send You news and newsletters, special offers and promotions, or to otherwise contact You about products or information You expressed interest in.

One of the purposes of the Services is for Users to share product- and vendor-related information with other Users. Therefore, You should assume that any information (including any Personal Information You may choose to provide, but excluding Your registration information) that You post will be made available to other Users of the Services.

Disclosure of Personal Information
----------------------------------

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, TechnologyAdvice does not disclose to or share Your Personal Information with third parties, unless You ask or authorize TechnologyAdvice to do so. TechnologyAdvice may provide Your Personal Information to third party service providers and suppliers who work on behalf of or with TechnologyAdvice to provide You with some of the services and features of the Services and to help us communicate with Users. However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this information except to help TechnologyAdvice provide the Services. TechnologyAdvice may share some or all of Your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case TechnologyAdvice will require Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

Data Retention
--------------

Unused data and data that falls outside of categories we deem commercially viable will be deleted. To ensure the accuracy of our recommendations and the privacy of Personal Information, TechnologyAdvice analyzes all records annually and deletes any that have gone untouched, unprocessed, and unreferenced in a timespan of 5 years. Data that has been requested to be forgotten will be deleted promptly.

Mergers
-------

In the event TechnologyAdvice goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.
