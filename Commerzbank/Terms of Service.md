In the event that the customer has contributed to the occurrence of the loss by any own fault (e.g. byviolating the duties to cooperate as mentioned in No. 11 of these Business Conditions), the principles of contributory negligence shall determinethe extent to which the Bank and the customer shall have to bear the loss.

(2) Orders passed on to third parties

The Bank itself may be sued by such customers onlybefore the court having jurisdiction for the bank office keeping the account.

(2) Time allowed for objections; approval by silence

Any objections a customer may have concerning the incorrectness or incompleteness of a periodic balance statement must be raised not laterthan six weeks after its receipt; if the objections are made in text form, it is sufficient to dispatch these within the period of six weeks. Failure tomake objections in due time shall be considered as approval. When issuing the periodic balance statement, the Bank shall expressly draw thecustomer’s attention to this consequence. The customer may demand a correction of the periodic balance statement even after expiry of thisperiod, but must then prove that the account was either wrongly debited or mistakenly not credited.

8. Reverse entries and correction entries made by the Bank(1) Prior to issuing a periodic balance statement

Incorrect credit entries on current accounts (e.g. due to a wrong account number) may be reversed by the Bank through a debit entry prior to theissue of the next periodic balance statement to the extent that the Bank has a repayment claim against the customer (reverse entry); in this case,the customer may not object to the debit entry on the grounds that a disposal of an amount equivalent to the credit entry has already been made.

(2) After issuing a periodic balance statement

If the Bank ascertains an incorrect credit entry after a periodic balance statement has been issued and if the Bank has a repayment claim againstthe customer, it shall debit the account of the customer with the amount of its claim (correction entry). If the customer objects to the correctionentry, the Bank shall re-credit the account with the amount in dispute and assert its repayment claim separately.

(3) Notification to the customer; calculation of interest

The Bank shall immediately notify the customer of any reverse entries and correction entries made. With respect to the calculation of interest, theBank shall effect the entries retroactively as of the day on which the incorrect entry was made.

If the Bank credits the countervalue of cheques and direct debits prior to their payment, this is done on condition of payment, even if these itemsare payable at the Bank itself. If the customer surrenders other items, instructing the Bank to collect an amount due from a debtor (e.g. interestcoupons), and if the Bank effects a credit entry for such amount, this is done under the reserve that the Bank shall obtain the amount. This reserveshall also apply if the cheques, direct debits and other items are payable at the Bank itself. If cheques or direct debits are not paid or if the Bankdoes not obtain the amount under the collection order, the Bank shall cancel the conditional credit entry regardless of whether or not a periodicbalance statement has been issued in the meantime.

(2) Payment of direct debits and of cheques made out by the customer

Direct debits and cheques shall be deemed to have been paid, unless the debit entry is cancelled prior to the end of the second bank workingday 1 – in the case of SEPA business-to-business (B2B) direct debits, prior to the end of the third bank working day – after it was made. Chequespayable in cash shall be deemed to have been paid once their amount has been paid to the presenting party. Cheques shall also be deemed tohave been paid as soon as the Bank dispatches an advice of payment.

(2) Credit entries for foreign currency transactions with the customer

If the Bank concludes a transaction with the customer (e.g. a forward exchange transaction) under which it owes the provision of an amount in a foreigncurrency, it shall discharge its foreign currency obligation by crediting the account of the customer in the respective currency, unless otherwise agreed.

(3) Temporary limitation of performance by the Bank

The Bank’s duty to execute a disposal order to the debit of a foreign currency credit balance (paragraph 1) or to discharge a foreign currencyobligation (paragraph 2) shall be suspended to the extent that and for as long as the Bank cannot or can only restrictedly dispose of the currencyin which the foreign currency credit balance or the obligation is denominated, due to political measures or events in the country of the respectivecurrency. To the extent that and for as long as such measures or events persist, the Bank is not obligated either to perform at some other placeoutside the country of the respective currency, in some other currency (including euros) or by providing cash. However, the Bank’s duty to executea disposal order to the debit of a foreign currency credit balance shall not be suspended if the Bank can execute it entirely within its ownorganisation. The right of the customer and of the Bank to set off mutual claims due in the same currency against each other shall not be affectedby the above provisions.

The Bank may demand that the customer provide the usual forms of security for any claims that may arise from the banking relationship, even ifsuch claims are conditional (e.g. indemnity for amounts paid under a guarantee issued on behalf of the customer). If the customer has assumeda liability for another customer’s obligations towards the Bank (e.g. as a surety), the Bank is, however, not entitled to demand that security beprovided or increased for the debt resulting from such liability incurred before the maturity of the debt.

(2) Changes in the risk

If the Bank, upon the creation of claims against the customer, has initially dispensed wholly or partly with demanding that security be provided orincreased, it may nonetheless make such a demand at a later time, provided, however, that circumstances occur or become known which justifya higher risk assessment of the claims against the customer. This may, in particular, be the case if– the economic status of the customer has changed or threatens to change in a negative manner or– the value of the existing security has deteriorated or threatens to deteriorate.The Bank has no right to demand security if it has been expressly agreed that the customer either does not have to provide any security or mustonly provide that security which has been specified. For consumer loan agreements, the Bank is entitled to demand that security be provided orincreased only to the extent that such security is mentioned in the loan agreement. When, however, the net loan amount exceeds EUR 75,000,the Bank may demand that security be provided or increased even if a consumer loan agreement or a general consumer loan agreement withinthe meaning of Section 491 (2) of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) which is concluded, in the former case, before 21 March2016 and, in the latter case, from 21 March 2016 does not contain any or any exhaustive indications as to security.

The Bank shall allow a reasonable period of time for providing or increasing security. If the Bank intends to make use of its right of terminationwithout notice according to No. 19 (3) of these Business Conditions should the customer fail to comply with the obligation to provide or increasesecurity within such period, it shall draw the customer’s attention to this consequence before doing so.

The customer and the Bank agree that the Bank acquires a lien on the securities and chattels which, within the scope of banking business, havecome or may come into the possession of a domestic office of the Bank. The Bank also acquires a lien on any claims which the customer has ormay in future have against the Bank arising from the banking relationship (e.g. credit balances).

(2) Secured claims

The lien serves to secure all existing, future and contingent claims arising from the banking relationship which the Bank with all its domestic andforeign offices is entitled to against the customer. If the customer has assumed liability for another customer’s obligations towards the Bank (e.g.as a surety), the lien shall not secure the debt resulting from the liability incurred before the maturity of the debt.

(3) Exemptions from the lien

If funds or other assets come into the power of disposal of the Bank under the reserve that they may only be used for a specified purpose (e.g.deposit of cash for payment of a bill of exchange), the Bank’s lien does not extend to these assets. The same applies to shares issued by theBank itself (own shares) and to securities which the Bank keeps in custody abroad for the customer’s account. Moreover, the lien extends neitherto the profit-participation rights/profit-participation certificates (Genussrechte/Genussscheine) issued by the Bank itself nor to the Bank’s securitisedand non-securitised subordinated liabilities.

Upon request of the customer, the Bank retransfers to the customer the ownership by way of securityof such items and of the claims that have passed to it if it does not, at the time of such request, have any claims against the customer that needto be secured or if it does not permit the customer to dispose of the countervalue of such items prior to their final payment.

Failure tomake objections in due time shall be considered as approval. When issuing the periodic balance statement, the Bank shall expressly draw thecustomer’s attention to this consequence. The customer may demand a correction of the periodic balance statement even after expiry of thisperiod, but must then prove that the account was either wrongly debited or mistakenly not credited.

8. Reverse entries and correction entries made by the Bank(1) Prior to issuing a periodic balance statement

Incorrect credit entries on current accounts (e.g. due to a wrong account number) may be reversed by the Bank through a debit entry prior to theissue of the next periodic balance statement to the extent that the Bank has a repayment claim against the customer (reverse entry); in this case,the customer may not object to the debit entry on the grounds that a disposal of an amount equivalent to the credit entry has already been made.

If the customer surrenders other items, instructing the Bank to collect an amount due from a debtor (e.g. interestcoupons), and if the Bank effects a credit entry for such amount, this is done under the reserve that the Bank shall obtain the amount. This reserveshall also apply if the cheques, direct debits and other items are payable at the Bank itself. If cheques or direct debits are not paid or if the Bankdoes not obtain the amount under the collection order, the Bank shall cancel the conditional credit entry regardless of whether or not a periodicbalance statement has been issued in the meantime.

Chequespayable in cash shall be deemed to have been paid once their amount has been paid to the presenting party.

(2) Credit entries for foreign currency transactions with the customer

If the Bank concludes a transaction with the customer (e.g. a forward exchange transaction) under which it owes the provision of an amount in a foreigncurrency, it shall discharge its foreign currency obligation by crediting the account of the customer in the respective currency, unless otherwise agreed.

(3) Temporary limitation of performance by the Bank

The Bank’s duty to execute a disposal order to the debit of a foreign currency credit balance (paragraph 1) or to discharge a foreign currencyobligation (paragraph 2) shall be suspended to the extent that and for as long as the Bank cannot or can only restrictedly dispose of the currencyin which the foreign currency credit balance or the obligation is denominated, due to political measures or events in the country of the respectivecurrency. To the extent that and for as long as such measures or events persist, the Bank is not obligated either to perform at some other placeoutside the country of the respective currency, in some other currency (including euros) or by providing cash. However, the Bank’s duty to executea disposal order to the debit of a foreign currency credit balance shall not be suspended if the Bank can execute it entirely within its ownorganisation.

V. Security for the Bank‘s Claims Against the Customer

13. Providing or increasing security(1) Right of the Bank to request security

The Bank may demand that the customer provide the usual forms of security for any claims that may arise from the banking relationship, even ifsuch claims are conditional (e.g. indemnity for amounts paid under a guarantee issued on behalf of the customer). If the customer has assumeda liability for another customer’s obligations towards the Bank (e.g. as a surety), the Bank is, however, not entitled to demand that security beprovided or increased for the debt resulting from such liability incurred before the maturity of the debt.

(2) Changes in the risk

If the Bank, upon the creation of claims against the customer, has initially dispensed wholly or partly with demanding that security be provided orincreased, it may nonetheless make such a demand at a later time, provided, however, that circumstances occur or become known which justifya higher risk assessment of the claims against the customer. This may, in particular, be the case if– the economic status of the customer has changed or threatens to change in a negative manner or– the value of the existing security has deteriorated or threatens to deteriorate.The Bank has no right to demand security if it has been expressly agreed that the customer either does not have to provide any security or mustonly provide that security which has been specified. For consumer loan agreements, the Bank is entitled to demand that security be provided orincreased only to the extent that such security is mentioned in the loan agreement. When, however, the net loan amount exceeds EUR 75,000,the Bank may demand that security be provided or increased even if a consumer loan agreement or a general consumer loan agreement withinthe meaning of Section 491 (2) of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) which is concluded, in the former case, before 21 March2016 and, in the latter case, from 21 March 2016 does not contain any or any exhaustive indications as to security.

(3) Setting a period of time for providing or increasing security

The Bank shall allow a reasonable period of time for providing or increasing security. If the Bank intends to make use of its right of terminationwithout notice according to No. 19 (3) of these Business Conditions should the customer fail to comply with the obligation to provide or increasesecurity within such period, it shall draw the customer’s attention to this consequence before doing so.

14. Lien in favour of the Bank(1) Agreement on the lien

The customer and the Bank agree that the Bank acquires a lien on the securities and chattels which, within the scope of banking business, havecome or may come into the possession of a domestic office of the Bank. The Bank also acquires a lien on any claims which the customer has ormay in future have against the Bank arising from the banking relationship (e.g. credit balances).

(2) Secured claims

The lien serves to secure all existing, future and contingent claims arising from the banking relationship which the Bank with all its domestic andforeign offices is entitled to against the customer. If the customer has assumed liability for another customer’s obligations towards the Bank (e.g.as a surety), the lien shall not secure the debt resulting from the liability incurred before the maturity of the debt.

(3) Exemptions from the lien

If funds or other assets come into the power of disposal of the Bank under the reserve that they may only be used for a specified purpose (e.g.deposit of cash for payment of a bill of exchange), the Bank’s lien does not extend to these assets. The same applies to shares issued by theBank itself (own shares) and to securities which the Bank keeps in custody abroad for the customer’s account. Moreover, the lien extends neitherto the profit-participation rights/profit-participation certificates (Genussrechte/Genussscheine) issued by the Bank itself nor to the Bank’s securitisedand non-securitised subordinated liabilities.

(4) Interest and dividend coupons

If securities are subject to the Bank‘s lien, the customer is not entitled to demand the delivery of the interest and dividend coupons pertaining tosuch securities.

(3) Special-purpose items for collection

If items for collection are deposited with the Bank under the reserve that their countervalue may only be used for a specified purpose, the transferor assignment of ownership by way of security does not extend to these items.
