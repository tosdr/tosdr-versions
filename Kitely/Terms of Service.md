Visit thousands of beautiful virtual worlds, each one created by a Kitely user just like you.

Build your own virtual worlds, tailored to your exact wishes.

Create a cool and unique avatar to represent you. Personalize your avatar with clothes and accessories. You can even appear as a non-human creature if you want.

Invite your friends to visit your worlds, or meet new people as you explore other Kitely worlds.

Play games, sail boats, engage in role-playing... What you can do is limited only by your imagination.

Visit historical recreations of ancient cities, practice chemistry with human-sized molecules, or learn a second language with native speakers. Kitely is a great platform for all education-related activities.

Save on travel time and shoe leather by hosting business meetings and even entire conferences in a virtual environment.

Buy items in Kitely Market for your avatar and worlds. You don't have to be an expert 3D modeler to look stylish.

Sell your virtual goods in Kitely Market. Our marketplace enables you to sell to all avatars in the Hypergrid-enabled metaverse from a single online store.

Kitely is the #1 choice for hosting OpenSim virtual worlds, home to many artists, educators and business owners. Our easy-to-use interface, low prices and Kitely Market make it easy and affordable to create your own virtual worlds.

Kitely users are friendly and welcoming. Visit [our forums](https://www.kitely.com/forums) if you have any questions, or want to share what you've created.

Our "World Pages" make it easy to share your virtual world with other people, by guiding them in the process of downloading the necessary software and entering your world.

Thanks to our cloud-based technology we can host virtual worlds for a very low price, without compromising on the speed and quality of the user experience.

Our service is based on OpenSim, a freely available open-source virtual worlds platform. This means that if you decide to leave Kitely you'll be able to take your creations with you.

We're part of the OpenSim Core Developers Group, so we can quickly resolve software issues if they arise.

Your Kitely avatar can travel to any location in the Hypergrid-enabled metaverse. You can also allow visitors from other Hypergrid-enabled grids to enter your worlds.

Our virtual-worlds platform is built using advanced cloud-based systems that provide more features and better performance than regular OpenSim. We use high-performance servers located in the world-class Amazon data center in California.

We automatically backup your data to multiple data centers. You can also download copies of your worlds to your own computer as standard OpenSim Archive (OAR) files.
