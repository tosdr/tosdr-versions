YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY SOFTWARE OR OTHER CONTENT DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE PRODUCT IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD, INSTALLATION OR USE OF SUCH SOFTWARE AND/OR CONTENT.

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, PARTNERS, MEMBERS, ADVERTISERS, INFORMATION PROVIDERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER DAMAGES (REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION), OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, DATA OR USE OF SYSTEMS, ARISING OUT OF (i) USE OF THE PRODUCT BY ANY PERSON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY ANY RELIANCE ON, OR ANY DELAYS, INACCURACIES, DEFECTS, MALFUNCTIONS, ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN, ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT OR SOFTWARE ACCESSED VIA THE PRODUCT, OR (ii) ANY USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT FOR WHATEVER REASON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE OR ANY OTHER FAILURE WITH TRANSMISSION OR DELIVERY OF ANY INFORMATION ACCESSED THROUGH THE PRODUCT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THESE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS SO THEY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

If any provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Licensor's failure to enforce the strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of Licensor's right to subsequently enforce such provisions or any other provisions of this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing.

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Licensor and its affiliates, and each of their officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, members, partners, advertisers, information providers and licensors, from any claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees, relating to or arising out of any breach of this Agreement or any use of the Plugin by you, or by any other person using the Plugin through you or using your computer.

Applicable Law, Jurisdiction and venue, Class actions

By using the Website, Product or Plugin, you agree that this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Israel, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. Any dispute relating in any way to the Plugin or this Agreement shall be adjudicated in the courts of Tel Aviv, Israel. You consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts and irrevocably waive all claims and arguments relating to lack of personal jurisdiction or inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Licensor shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

To the extent permitted by APPLICABLE law, YOU agree that YOU will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST LICENSOR, its affiliates or ITS OR their respective employees, officers, directors, members, managers, PARTNERS, advertisers, representatives and assigns. YOU AGREE to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove YOU as a participant in the suit. YOU AGREE to pay the attorney's fees and court costs that LICENSOR incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing YOU from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement and does not constitute a waiver of any of YOUR rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action.
