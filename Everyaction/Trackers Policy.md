We power those who power social impact.

Software for social good
------------------------

### Software is just part of our business.  
We are also changing the world.

### A vision for change

We’re innovating with a higher purpose: to increase giving to 3% of US GDP by 2033, a number that’s stayed flat for over 50 years.

### Mission-critical technology to back it

We build enterprise-grade software — supported by coaching and expertise — to power trillions of dollars in new impact. No matter how big your mission scales, Bonterra scales with you.

### Our 1:1 philosophy

For every dollar we make, we strive to change a life. A billion dollars means a billion lives changed. That’s the heart of our business model.

Bonterra is the first donor CRM company I’ve ever used that felt like partners in the work...Their focus is on the mission, and they understand who we are, what the money we raised is really for, and why people are choosing to give it. Everything we talk about and do together has a shared sense of mission and purpose that I haven’t found anywhere else.
