1\. General
-----------

1.1 Thanks for using ProWritingAid.com and related services ("Services"). These ProWritingAid Terms of Service ("Terms") describe your rights and responsibilities as a customer of ProWritingAid.

1.2 These Terms are between you ("you") and Orpheus Technology Ltd ("Orpheus", "we" or "us"). By registering for the Services you are agreeing to be bound by the following Terms. Please read these Terms before using the Services. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not register for the Services.

1.3 These Terms shall govern all documents related to orders of our Services, including any online, email, or in-app ordering processes that are agreed between you and Orpheus (each an "Order"). Each agreed Order shall incorporate these Terms.

1.4 IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.

1.5 If we make material changes to these Terms, we’ll let you know either through the site or via email (at the email address you provide). If you do not agree to those changes, you may send a request to cancel your account to support@prowritingaid.com. If we do not hear from you within ten days, the revised terms will apply to you.

2\. Free services and paid services
-----------------------------------

2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions agreed in each Order, Orpheus grants you access to its writing assistant software which is offered as software-as-a-service as well as any related websites, services, applications, learning content, and features as specified in the Order ("Services"). Orpheus may offer free-of-charge services with limited functionalities ("Free Services") or services against payment of Service Fees with certain agreed functionalities ("Paid Services"), each as specified in the Order.

2.2 Orpheus may implement new versions and upgrades of Paid Services including, but not limited to, modifications to the design, operational method, technical specifications, systems, and other functions of Paid Services, at any time in accordance with applicable law, in particular to the extent that such changes are necessary to maintain the contractual compliance of Paid Services or for compelling technical, economic or legal reasons.

2.3 Orpheus may downgrade, limit or otherwise modify Free Services at any time without notice. Subject to Clause 9, Orpheus shall have no obligations with regard to any guarantee, indemnity, Maintenance or Support and availability pertaining to Free Services. Free Services are not a guarantee of (future) product features of Paid Services.

2.4 Orpheus may grant you access to Paid Services free-of-charge or at reduced Service Fees as part of a trial evaluation for a period determined by Orpheus in its sole discretion ("Trial Use"). Orpheus may downgrade, limit or otherwise modify the Services provided for Trial Use at any time without notice. Subject to Clause 9, Orpheus shall have no obligations with regard to any guarantee, indemnity, Maintenance or Support and availability pertaining to Trial Use. Orpheus may revoke or terminate any Trial Use at any time without giving prior notice to you. Trial Use is not a guarantee of (future) product features. Subject to the terms and conditions agreed in the Order, Trial Use of Services may end and shall then automatically transform into regular Paid Services.

2.5 Orpheus may retain subcontractors, including third-party software suppliers, for the performance of any of its obligations under any Order at any time.

2.6 You must pay the fees for Paid Services as specified in the Order in accordance with the terms therein (the "Service Fees").

3\. Permitted users
-------------------

3.1 ProWritingAid is designed for use by adults. You must be thirteen years of age or older to use it. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under the age of thirteen, please contact us at hello@ProWritingAid.com. When you use the site, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to form a binding contract with us, and are doing so by your agreement to these terms.

4\. Copyright and intellectual property
---------------------------------------

4.1 Subject to Clause 4.2, we never use or access your content unless you specifically permit us to or where it’s required in order to comply with the law. For grammar checking, once checking has been completed, all submitted texts and their improvements will be deleted. When using ProWritingAid, your texts will not be used to improve the quality of our services. Beware: other providers do not take this approach, and you may be granting them rights to use your content as they wish. We use texts hand corrected by professional copyeditors to train our algorithms to ensure that our data is of the highest quality.

4.2 We own our stuff; you own yours.

4.3 You retain ownership of all content you post, upload to, or otherwise share on the site.

* Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.

15\. Referral program
---------------------

15.1 To qualify for a free license through our referral program ("Referral License"), you must refer only valid customers ("Referred Customers"). We employ automated monitoring mechanisms to ensure that Referred Customers are only counted if they actually use the product. ProWritingAid reserves the right to review, investigate, and disqualify any Referral License that violates the Referral Program, such as attempting to gain a Referral License through self-referral, by using a different email address, or any other mechanism that is against the spirit of the Referral Program.
