We are committed to securing your personal information. We implement reasonable and appropriate technological and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction and we comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations.

**5\. Cookies**

We use cookies to provide our Website and W&B Services. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile device. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, some features of our Website and W&B Services may not function properly.

**6\. Your Rights**

Data protection laws give individuals rights with respect to the collection and use of their personal information. Please fill out the information [here](https://preferences.wandb.ai/privacy?_gl=1*oflud4*_ga*MTY1MDMyMDUyMy4xNjkyNjI1NDg3*_ga_JH1SJHJQXJ*MTcwNzQ5MjAwNS4yOTAuMS4xNzA3NDkzNDQxLjMyLjAuMA..) if you wish to exercise any of these rights. We will fulfil any such requests in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

See details

Depending on the laws that apply in your country and to which we are subject, you may have rights under applicable data protection laws to:

* request access to, correction of, deletion of, or portability of personal information that we process about you;
* request that we restrict processing, or to object to our processing, of personal information about you;
* opt-out of marketing communications that we may send you, for example, by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any marketing emails;
* not be subject to wholly automated decisions if these have legal effects on you or significantly affect you; and
* if our processing is based on your consent, withdraw your consent to our processing (although this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing prior to your withdrawal).

  
In addition, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority about our use of your personal information. However, while you are not required to do so, we ask that you contact us first to give us the opportunity to address your concerns directly before speaking with your data protection authority.

**7\. Data Retention**

We store the personal information we collect for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, including as long as is necessary to provide you with the Website or W&B Services, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements.

When we have no ongoing need to use your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information is stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**8\. International Transfers**

W&B is located in the United States, but we and our service providers operate in various countries around the world. For these reasons, when you visit our Website or use W&B Services, your personal information may be transferred to countries other than the country in which you reside. W&B will take all necessary measures to ensure that your personal information is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and that any such transfers are lawful, including through the use of standard contractual clauses. Additionally, we obtain contractual commitments from third party service providers to protect your personal information.

**9\. Additional Information**

Some countries may have specific requirements that apply when we transfer personal information internationally. Where this is the case, the requirements that apply and measures we take to comply with those requirements are described further here.

See details

If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom (“UK”), then please note the following additional information:

1\. Data controller

The data controller of your personal information is W&B.  You can contact us using the details provided herein.

2\. EEA/UK legal basis

We will collect and use your personal information only where:

* We have your consent (which will be apparent from the context, because we will ask for you consent when you provide your personal information);
* it is necessary to perform a contract with you (for example, we must process your payments data in order to fulfil any order you place with us), in which case we will be unable to fulfil our contract with you if you do not provide necessary information;
* the use is within our legitimate interests and not adverse to your rights and freedoms (for example, to send you marketing communications, provided this is consistent with your communications preferences); or
* it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.

  
As we may rely on different legal bases for each of the different categories of personal information we process and the purposes for which we process them, please contact us if you would like further information about the specific legal basis relied upon in any particular context.

3\. International Transfers

If we transfer your personal information to a country outside of the EEA (for EEA residents) or the UK (for UK residents), we will ensure that any such transfers are compliant with EU and UK data protection law, as applicable.

We will only transfer your personal information to a non-EEA or non-UK recipient where:

* The recipient is located in a country that the European Commission has decided is adequate to receive personal information from the EEA or the UK Secretary of State has decided is adequate to receive personal information from the UK, as applicable;
* The recipient has signed appropriate contractual terms with W&B that incorporate the European Commission’s [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en) or the UK Information Commissioner’s [International Data Transfer Agreement or International Data Transfer Addendum](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/), as applicable; or
* A data transfer derogation applies (for example, where you have consented to the transfer of your personal information).

  
For Japan, “W&B” in this Privacy Policy means Weights and Biases Japan K.K. We may provide personal information obtained for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy (“Purposes”) to third parties, including our affiliate, Weights and Biases, Inc. These third parties will only process personal information for fulfilling the Purposes. We will supervise the appropriate handling of personal data by such third parties.

‍Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to obtain certain information about the types of personal information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship (and that are not otherwise exempt) have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, including the names and addresses of those third parties, and examples of the types of services or products marketed by those third parties. If you wish to submit a request pursuant to Section 1798.83, please contact Weights and Biases via email at support@wandb.com.

If you have further questions about our international data transfers and the specific measures we use in any case, please contact us for further information.

**10\. Children**

Neither our Website nor W&B Services are intended for or advertised to children under 16. We do not knowingly or intentionally collect information about children under 16.

If you believe that we have collected information about a child under 16, please contact us using the details provided above so that we may delete the information.

**11\. Updates**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. We will provide notice of any such changes (including when they will take effect) in accordance with law. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.
