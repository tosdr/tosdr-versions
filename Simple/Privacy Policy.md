This privacy policy applies to Simple Technology Pty Ltd, its affiliates and related bodies corporate (**us, we, our**). We take the protection of your personal information very seriously and are committed to compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws, including the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (together, the **GDPR**).

This privacy policy gives you information on how we collect, store, use, process and disclose personal information. Personal information and/or personal data (the terms commonly used in applicable privacy laws) is information or an opinion about an identified or reasonably identifiable individual, whether the information or opinion is true or not and whether the information is recorded in a material form or not.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us using the contact information in section 15 of this privacy policy.

  

### 2.0 WHY WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

The personal information that we collect about depends on our relationship with you, the circumstances of collection and the products or services that you apply for, purchase, and/or enquire about. We may use personal information you have supplied for purposes including to:

• identify you as the user of our products and services and to provide better client service to you, your business partners and your employees;  
• perform authorised financial transactions with you and your associated service providers;  
• operate our business, including as it applies to you;  
• where you have consented, to keep you informed about Simple products and services and those of relevant business partners;  
• participate in the process of any third party acquisition or potential acquisition of an interest in us and/or our assets;  
• to fulfil our legal and regulatory obligations; and  
• to improve and optimise our platforms (including our websites), products and services.

  

### 3.0 LAWFUL BASIS OF PROCESSING INFORMATION

We only collect and use personal information about you when the law allows us to. To the extent you are located in the United Kingdom (**UK**) or European Economic Area (**EEA**) we most commonly use personal information where:

• the data subject (you) has given consent to the processing activity taking place;  
• If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract;  
• if the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; and  
• if the processing in necessary for our legitimate interests or those of any third party.

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make it clear to you what those legitimate interests are at the relevant time.

  

### 4.0 WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW

Consistent with the provision of our products and services, the types of personal information we may collect and hold includes the following.

In some cases, we may collect information about you indirectly, such as from third party providers of our products and services, providers of data analytics services and providers of third party websites, apps and social media platforms. We may also collect personal information about you indirectly when a third party whom you have a relationship with uses our products and services, such as when a company who you have purchased products and/or services from, provides us your personal information so we can provide our products and and/or services to them. Where we receive personal information about you from such third parties, we require that they have collected and disclosed that information with your knowledge or consent (to the extent required by applicable laws).

For example, we have in place a robust access control policy which limits access to your personal information to those employees, contractors and other third parties who only have a business need to know your personal information. We also have policies and procedures to handle any potential data security breaches and data subjects, third parties and any applicable regulators will be notified where we are legally required to do so.
