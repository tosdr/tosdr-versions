Cookie Notice

Last modified Feb 17, 2023

This Cookie Notice explains how VSCO uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with our mobile application (**“App”**), as well as any of our websites that post or link to this Cookie Notice (collectively, the **“Sites”**).

#### What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience.

Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them).

We use two categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies that we directly serve to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites, and (2) third party cookies that are served by our service providers and are used to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. Third party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, marketing, and social media features.

This table summarizes the cookies we use.

Who serves these cookies

_Targeting_

These cookies are used by companies to collect information about how you use our Sites and other websites over time. These companies use this information to show you ads they believe will be relevant to you within our Services and elsewhere, and to measure how the ads perform.  
  
You can opt-out of Google Doubleclick cookies [here](https://adssettings.google.com/).  
  
You can opt-out of Facebook cookies [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads).

[Google](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)[Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation)

_Performance_

These cookies help us understand how our Services are performing and being used. These cookies may work with web beacons included in emails we send to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.  
  
You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies) and about how Google protects your data [here](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Services by downloading and installing a browser plugin available [here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

_Necessary_

These cookies are necessary to allow the technical operation of our Services (e.g., they enable you to move around on a website and to use its features).

VSCO

[Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)

_Social Media_

These cookies may allow you to log into the Sites or App through your social media account or share content in our sites that you find interesting through third party social media providers. These cookies may also be used for marketing purposes.

#### Your choices regarding cookies

You have a few different options for controlling what information cookies collect about you.

* **Blocking cookies in your browser**. Most browsers let you limit or reject cookies by configuring your browser settings accordingly.
* **Opting-In from the UK or Europe**. If you’re visiting our website from a computer in the UK or Europe, you can opt-in to receiving performance, functional, targeting, and social media cookies through the cookie banner presented to you when you visit our website or through the Cookie Settings link in the footer of our website. We will not serve your device these cookies unless you opt-in.
* **Opting-Out of Cookies from outside of Europe**. If you are visiting our website from a computer outside of Europe, you can opt out of receiving performance, functional, targeting, and social media cookies by clicking the “Cookies Settings” link (or, if you are located in California, the “Do Not Share My Personal Information” link) in the footer and selecting the category of cookies you would like to disable.
* **Opting-Out of Third Party Cookies**. You can opt-out of interest-based advertising through some of the third parties listed in the chart above by using the corresponding opt-out tools mentioned in the chart.
* **Industry association opt-outs**. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking [**here**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking [**here**](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). You can also opt out of receiving targeted advertising in mobile apps through participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by using the AppChoices mobile app. Please note that we may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in these opt-out.
* **Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings**. You may be able to configure your mobile device to limit how your information can be used for interest-based advertising purposes.

If you don’t accept our cookies, your experience with our Sites might not be ideal. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device, and you may need to log in every time you visit our Sites.

If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.

#### Other technologies

In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology to pixel tags to collect information automatically.

_Browser Web Storage_

We may use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as locally stored objects (**“LSOs”**), for similar purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. Your web browser may provide functionality to clear your browser web storage.

_Web Beacons_

We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of our Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively.

_Software Development Kits (SDKs)_

We may use third-party software development kits (**“SDKs”**) in our mobile applications or Web applications. A SDK is third-party computer code that may be used for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our Services, to integrate with social media, add features or functionality to our app, or to facilitate online advertising. SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly via our Services.

For more information about how we collect, use and share your information, see our [**Privacy Policy**](https://vsco.co/about/privacy-policy)**.**

#### Changes

Information about the cookies we use may be updated from time to time, so please check back on a regular basis for any changes.
