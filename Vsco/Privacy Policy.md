We typically collect this information through a variety of first- or third-party tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, APIs, mobile SDKs, location-identifying tools, and similar technologies, and we may otherwise use third-party partners to collect, monitor, or record this information. This information may be combined, either via such technologies or through another process, with information that you provided to us directly or information that we receive from a third party. You may be able to configure your browser and device settings to limit or disable the use of cookies or similar technologies. You can learn more in the “Your choices” section of this Privacy Policy.

#### How we use your data

Once we collect your data, we use it in a few different ways. This table summarizes the different ways we may use your data.

How We Use Your Data

What this means

**Delivering our Services  
**We’ll use your data to provide our Services to you.

We use your data to provide and enhance our Services and our business, establish, and maintain your account and profile, and related content, promote and facilitate business between yourself and businesses, enable security features, communicate with you about our Services, understand your needs and interests as they relate to our Services, personalize your experience with our Services, respond to your requests, questions, and comments, and invite your contacts that you invite to join our Services.

**Improving our Services  
**We may use your data to help us improve our products and services.

We use your data to monitor our Services, and to improve the performance and effectiveness of our Services, offers, advertising, communications features (such as live and automated chat), and customer service functionality. We may also use analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for our Services and to understand more about the demographics and behaviors of our creators.

**Research and Development  
**We might use your data to help us make our Services better.

We may use your data for research and development so we can understand and improve our Services.  
  
As part of these activities, we may also create aggregated, de-identified, or other anonymous data from personal information we collect. We make personal information into anonymous data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you.

**Marketing  
**Depending on your choices, you might get marketing communications about our Services or other services.

**Direct marketing**. We may send you direct marketing communications about our Services or products or services that we offer with our marketing partners.  
  
If you would rather not receive our marketing emails, you can follow the steps in the “[Opt-Out of Marketing](https://vsco.co/about/privacy-policy#l5)” section later in this Privacy Policy.  
‍  
**Interest-based advertising**. We may engage third-party advertising partners to display ads on our Services and on third-party properties. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies in connection with our Services, our communications, and on other services, and use the information collected via such technologies to serve ads on our Services that they think will interest you (e.g., ads from third-party advertisers) or on other third-party properties (e.g., ads from VSCO or other ads that may interest you). This activity is typically called interest-based advertising or targeted advertising.  
  
We may also receive information about our creators from third-party advertising partners, which we then use to match to, and better understand, those creators or similar creators within our Services to serve targeted advertising to those creators on an advertiser’s behalf. Similarly, we may upload information about our creators to advertising partners to facilitate interest-based advertising to those users, or similar users, on our or other services. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising in the “Your choices” section of this Privacy Policy.  
  
We may also disclose information, such as event data, ad view/click data, and user identifiers, to advertising partners for purposes of measuring the effectiveness of ads (e.g., whether actions that you take on or off our Services were a result of ads that you may have seen or clicked on).  
‍  
Note that information we may receive from other sources may also be used for interest-based advertising purposes, such as information we receive that helps us better understand our users.

**Compliance and Protection  
**We may need to use your data in certain ways to make sure we provide our Services legally and safely.

To provide our Services, we must be mindful of the many legal, ethical, and contractual requirements that apply to us, while also trying to protect our creators and our Services.  
  
To that end, we might use your data as needed to comply with the law, respond to lawful data requests (like subpoenas and warrants), protect our creators, protect our rights (including by establishing and defending against legal claims), comply with any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, enforce our terms and policies, and prevent or investigate fraudulent, harmful, or illegal activity.

#### How we share your data

We might need to share your data with other parties to help us do the things mentioned above. This table summarizes the other parties that might receive your data.

Who we might share your data with

Why we might share your data with them

Affiliates

We might share your data with our corporate affiliates or subsidiaries to do the things mentioned in this Privacy Policy.

Service Providers and Partners

We lean on certain companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate our Services or our business. These service providers perform services like data hosting, email delivery and marketing activities, and provide or support features like chat and communications tools, information technology, customer service and website monitoring and analytics. We may also collaborate with other companies on partnerships intended to help distribute, enhance, or extend our Services or to bring you co-branded product experiences.

Advertising Partners and Intermediaries

We work with third-party advertising partners and intermediaries (e.g., ad networks, retargeters, sell-side or demand-side platforms, ad servers, clean rooms, identity resolution providers, measurement providers, publishers such as social media platforms or digital/print content providers, advertisers, agencies) to facilitate the delivery of advertising to you on VSCO or on third-party properties or to measure the effectiveness of those ads.  
  
You can learn about the options you have to opt-out of interest-based advertising in the “[Your Choices](#)” section of this Privacy Policy.

Professional Advisors

We may need to share your data with our professional advisors, like our lawyers, auditors, bankers, and insurers if it’s necessary for them to provide their services.

Authorities and Others

We may need to share your data with law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties if we need to do so for the compliance or protection purposes described above.

Business Transferees

If we go through a business transaction like a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or some of our assets, we may share or transfer your data to the parties (or their advisors) to the transaction during the transaction or in contemplation of the transaction (including during due diligence).

Other Creators, Companies and the Public

Your profile and content are publicly visible and can be seen and used by others.  
  
We may create other ways you can interact and communicate with other creators, including things like tipping and other ways you can support creators monetarily. The data related to these interactions will be visible by other creators.  
  
We may also offer ways for you to interact with businesses that may wish to work with you, and your contact details may be made available to facilitate such potential interactions. More broadly, certain data relating to these interactions may be visible b businesses, other creators, and the public. 

We make commercially reasonable efforts to verify that any third parties who we share personal information with provide a level of protection of personal information that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Except for service providers and affiliates, any such third parties may use such personal information as described in their own privacy policies or otherwise pursuant to their own practices. 

#### How Long We Keep Your Data

We retain data for as long as we need for the uses mentioned above. You can delete your account by following the instructions [**here**](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/360004196352-How-do-I-delete-my-VSCO-Account-).

When we don’t need your personal information anymore, we’ll either delete it or anonymize it, unless deletion or anonymization isn’t possible or practical (for example, because your data is in backup archives), in which case we’ll make sure your data is securely stored and isolated from further processing.

Remember that it is impossible to ensure that anything on the internet is ever completely removed. Even after your account is deleted, your content may still be visible, for example, if you’ve shared it on other platforms or if other people copied or shared your content before you deleted your account.

#### Your choices

You have control over your data in several ways. This table summarizes your choices concerning your data. If you’re located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah or Virginia, you can find additional information in the [U.S. State Law Privacy Rights](#) section below.

What you can do with your data

How to make it happen

Access or update your information

You can review and update certain account information by logging into your account.

Opt-out of marketing communications

You can opt-out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of a marketing email, or by [**contacting us**](https://support.vsco.co/). You will continue to receive other non-marketing emails related to our Services. If you receive marketing text messages from us, you can opt out by replying STOP to our marketing message.

Adjust cookie preferences

You can opt out of the use of certain cookies and similar technologies by clicking “Your Privacy Choices” in the footer of the website and adjusting your preferences. Additionally, most browsers let you limit or reject cookies by configuring your browser settings accordingly.

Disable mobile location data

You can disable our access to your device’s geolocation in your mobile device settings.

Decline to provide information

You can decide not to give us certain data, but then you may not be able to use certain features of our Services.

Configure third party platform settings

If you connect to our Services through a third party platform (like a social media account), you may be able to use your settings in your account with that platform to limit the information we receive from it moving forward.

Delete your content and account

You can choose to delete certain content of yours from your account. You can delete your account entirely by following the instructions [**here**](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/360004196352-How-do-I-delete-my-VSCO-Account-).  
  
If you are under 18 years of age, you can also use these same instructions to exercise your right to delete your content under California’s “Online Eraser” Law.

Opt-out of interest-based advertising

You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on websites through participating members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking [**here**](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking [**here**](https://optout.aboutads.info/). You can also opt out of receiving interest-based advertising in mobile apps through participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by using the AppChoices mobile app. Please note that we may work with companies that may not participate in these opt-out mechanisms but may offer their own opt-out.

Limit advertising ID use in your mobile settings

You may be able to configure your mobile device to limit how your mobile advertising ID can be used for interest-based advertising purposes.

#### How we secure your data

We use technical, organizational, and physical safeguards to protect your data, like firewalls and other security technology. For example, when you enter confidential information (such as login credentials or information submitted from within our Services), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, there is always risk when doing anything on the internet, so we can’t guarantee 100% security of your data. If we find out that we’ve had a data breach and your personal information has been compromised, we’ll notify you as required by law and take appropriate steps to investigate and remedy the vulnerability.

#### International data transfer

We’re headquartered in the United States and may use service providers in other countries. Your data may be processed or stored in the United States or other countries outside of where you live, which may have data protection laws that are different from those in your country. When we transfer data across borders, we take measures to comply with the relevant data protection laws governing the transfer.

#### General audience service

Our Services are intended for a general audience. As such, they are not directed or targeted toward children under 13 years of age and are not intended for use by children under 13. If we learn that we collected data through our Services from a child under 13 without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete it.

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. If we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you via email, through a notification posted on our Services, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. In all cases, your use of our Services after the effective date mentioned in any updated Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

U.S. State Privacy Rights
-------------------------

This section provides additional disclosures to California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia residents under their respective state privacy laws, including further information on their rights under such laws.

In this section, when we use the term “personal information” we mean it (or similar term, such as “personal data”) as it is defined under those laws. 

**Verification.** We’ll need enough detail to understand and respond to your request. We may need to verify your identity to process your requests and may also need to confirm your state residency. To verify your identity, we may require a combination of government identification, a copy of the receipt for your VSCO membership, or other information. We may also require you to login from a verified valid device or verify that the device you’re logging in from is valid.

**Authorized Agents.** You can have an authorized agent make a request on your behalf, but we’ll need to verify your agent’s identity. We would also need a copy of a valid power of attorney, or a written and signed permission to exercise your privacy rights on your behalf. We may still need to verify your identity and may ask you to directly confirm that you provided your authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf.

**Sensitive Information.** We process “sensitive personal information” (or similar term, such as “sensitive data”) only as reasonably expected for providing theservices that you’ve requested or as otherwise permitted without requiring a corresponding right to restrict or limit such use.

**Profiling.** We do not undertake any “profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects” on our creators.

**Retention.** The duration of how long we retain personal information is generally based on how long we need it for the purposes for which it was collected, which includes complying with our legal obligations.

#### Your Privacy Rights

You have certain rights regarding your personal information under the state consumer privacy laws listed above, subject to certain exceptions under such applicable law. Here, we provide a summary of your rights relating to personal information and how to exercise them. You are entitled to exercise these rights free from discrimination.

**Access.** You have the right to access a copy of your personal information, which you can do by following the instructions available [**here**](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/360052896671-How-do-I-access-a-copy-of-my-personal-data-on-VSCO-), or by submitting a request [**here**](https://vsco.formstack.com/forms/vsco_data_request).

**Correction.** You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we have collected about you. You can do so by submitting a support request [**here**](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us), or by submitting a request [**here**](https://vsco.formstack.com/forms/vsco_data_request).

**Deletion.** You have the right to request deletion of the personal information that we have collected from you, which you can do by following the instructions available [**here**](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/360004196352-How-do-I-delete-my-VSCO-Account-), or by submitting a request [**here**](https://vsco.formstack.com/forms/vsco_data_request). But if we delete your personal information, we might not be able to provide our Services to you.

**Opting out of “sales,” “sharing,” and processing for “targeted advertising” purposes.**

Like many companies, we work with advertising partners and intermediaries (e.g., ad networks, retargeters, sell-side or demand-side platforms, ad servers, clean rooms, identity resolution providers, measurement providers, publishers such as social media platforms or digital/print content providers, advertisers, agencies) to help deliver targeted ads to you on VSCO or other properties based on your activity across unrelated properties (e.g., your activity on VSCO and social media networks or other digital properties) and to measure the effectiveness of such ads.  

Through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, we make personal information (e.g., device data tied to online activity data, identity data such as email addresses or phone numbers) available to such partners or intermediaries for such purposes. We may also upload information (e.g., email address, phone number) about our creators to these partners or intermediaries to facilitate such purposes. In either case, under certain state consumer privacy laws, these disclosures of personal information may be considered a “sale” or “share” (or processing for “targeted advertising” more generally) unless certain exceptions apply (e.g., disclosing personal information to a “service provider” or “processor,” where applicable).

If we know that you’re 13-15 years of age, we won’t “sell”or “share” your Personal Information unless we get your consent to do so.

‍_Opting out of “Sales,” “Shares,” and“Targeted Advertising” Involving Cookies or Other Tracking Technologies_

You can opt-out of "sales,” “shares,” and processing for “targeted advertising” that occur via cookies or other tracking technologies by clicking **Your Privacy Choices** in our website footer below and opting out of “Targeting Cookies”. Your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser on the device from which you submit the request, and, if you delete your cookies, you will need to opt-out again in a subsequent session on this website. Alternatively, for this opt-out in relation to cookies and other tracking technologies, you can also broadcast the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt-out on each participating browser on the device that you’re using. Learn more at the [**Global Privacy Control website**](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

To opt-out of “sales/shares” or processing for “targeted advertising” that do not rely on third-party advertising partners or intermediaries’ tracking technologies on this website (e.g., upload of users’ email addresses to other social media platforms to target them with ads), you must also opt out by submitting a request [here](https://vsco.formstack.com/forms/vsco_data_request) (also accessible via our **Your Privacy Choices** link).

**Appeals.** If you are a Colorado, Connecticut, Motana, Oregon, Texas, or Virginia resident, you may appeal our refusal to take action on a request exercising one of your rights mentioned above by contacting our [Support Team.](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us)

**Right to Know.** If you’re a California resident, you have the right to know the following as it relates to the last 12 months: the categories of PersonalInformation that we’ve collected about you, the categories of sources from which we’ve collected the Personal Information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling,” or “sharing” the Personal Information, the categories of recipients to whom we’ve disclosed the personal information for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was “sold” or “shared.” You can find this information in the table below.

Privacy Notice to European Creators
-----------------------------------

The information provided in this notice applies only to individuals in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland (collectively, “**Europe**”) and explains our practices regarding personal data that we collect from you or which we have obtained about you from a third party, and the legal bases for processing your personal data. It also describes your rights in respect to our processing of your personal data.

**Personal data.** “Personal data” as used in this notice has the same meaning given in European data protection legislation.

**Controller.** VSCO is the controller of your personal data covered by this Privacy Policy for purposes of European data protection legislation.

**Data protection representative**. Our data protection representative in the EU and UK is VeraSafe. You may contact them at:

* **VeraSafe Ireland Ltd.**, Unit 3D North Point House, North Point Business Park, New Mallow Road, Cork T23AT2P, Ireland
* **VeraSafe United Kingdom Ltd.**, 37 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7TL, United Kingdom

**Legal bases for processing****. We use your personal data only as permitted by law. Our legal bases for processing personal data are described in the table below.**

**Processing purpose  
  
**‍_Details regarding each processing purpose listed below are provided in the section of our Privacy Policy titled “How we use your data”._

Legal basis

[**Delivering our Services**](#)

Processing is necessary to perform the contract governing our provision of our Services or to take steps that you request prior to signing up for our Services. If we have not entered into a contract with you, we process your personal data based on our legitimate interest in providing our Services you access and request.

[**Research and development  
‍  
‍**](#)[**Marketing  
‍  
‍**](#)[**Compliance and protection  
‍  
‍**](#)**As otherwise described in the Privacy Policy**

These activities constitute our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for these activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

Processing activities for which you have consented

Processing is based on your consent. Where we rely on your consent, you have the right to withdraw it any time in the manner indicated when you consent or in our Services.

**Use for new purposes**. We may use your personal data for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.

**Retention**. We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

When we no longer require the personal data we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
