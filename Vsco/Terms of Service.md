We nurture creative experimentation and turn the aspirational into the achievable. At VSCO, we believe that there’s a creative spark within all of us and that everyone, at heart, is a creator. Welcome to the VSCO community!

These Terms of Use (“**Terms**” or “**Agreement**”) apply to your use of any of our websites, mobile apps, products, or services, including VSCO Hub (our “**Services**”). These Terms apply to anyone who accesses our Services, whether as registered users or guests (each a “**Creator**” or “**you**”), and is an agreement between you and Visual Supply Company (“**VSCO**”).

We’ve removed as much legal language as possible to make it easier for you to understand your rights and obligations regarding our Services. Since these Terms (which include our [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community-guidelines)) form a binding legal agreement between you and VSCO, however, we included necessary legal language in certain provisions. Please read these Terms carefully.

By using our Services, you agree:

* to follow the [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community-guidelines) at all times while accessing or using our Services;
* that we have the sole discretion to investigate and determine whether someone has violated our [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community-guidelines) and to what extent we enforce our [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community-guidelines), including when to terminate Creators’ VSCO accounts and remove Creator Content (defined below); and
* to our collection and use of personal data as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://vsco.co/about/privacy-policy).

We respect and value the intellectual property rights of others and comply to the fullest extent with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“**DMCA**”). You can notify us and request removal of your copyright protected work via the form provided in our [**DMCA Policy**](https://vsco.co/about/contact/copyright) (incorporated into these Terms).

**Subscription Notice: If you purchase a Subscription, your Subscription will continue for the time period you selected at purchase. Your Subscription will automatically renew for similar time periods at our then-current fees, unless you decide not to renew. If you terminate your VSCO account, this will not automatically cancel your Subscription. You can cancel your Subscription or opt out of any renewal by following the steps described here and in our** [**Help Center**](https://support.vsco.co/).

**Arbitration Notice: These Terms describe how disputes between you and VSCO will be resolved. With limited exceptions, disputes must first be resolved through an informal claims resolution process as described in Section 13 below. If disputes are not resolved through such informal process, they must be submitted to binding and final arbitration. You may pursue claims and seek relief against us only on an individual basis, and not as a representative plaintiff or class member in any class action. You also waive your right to resolve claims in court proceedings and to a jury trial, except in specific cases. You may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement as explained below in more detail**.

#### 1\. USE OF OUR SERVICES

There are some ground rules you must follow that are intended to protect the VSCO community. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you can choose to not use our Services.

**Service Rules**. Be reasonable and responsible. Don’t do anything that is illegal or could harm our Creators, VSCO, our Services, or any user of our Services.. When using our Services, you are responsible for your interactions with others. For example, don’t do the following while using our Services:

* Harm others (including impersonating or violating another’s rights or collecting anyone else’s personal information; sending spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited communications);
* Use, copy, make derivatives of, distribute or exploit our Services or any content available through our Services for any commercial or competitive purpose (including “scraping” information or content; decompiling or reverse engineering our Services; framing, hotlinking, or using similar techniques to include VSCO Marks, our Services or Creator Content; training artificial intelligence models on our content or our Creator Content; uploading content you receive through our Services (including Creator Content) into any artificial intelligence tools (including generative AI), bots, software, or other external applications; or otherwise hosting our Services or any other person’s Creator Content on another site, in each case, other than your own and without the prior written consent of VSCO);
* Attempt any technological attack (including accessing information regarding our Services’ underlying infrastructure; causing a large load on our infrastructure, such as through “robots,” “spiders,” and other automated systems; interfering with our Services; bypassing measures we use to restrict access to our Services; accessing or deciphering any unauthorized content or transmissions; or uploading viruses, worms, or other harmful agents); or
* Use our Services for any fraudulent purpose or purpose prohibited by these Terms, including our [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community-guidelines), or any laws.

**Eligibility**. You must be at least 13 years old to use our Services and legally agree to and comply with these Terms. If your VSCO account or access to our Services is discontinued by us due to your violation of these Terms, you may not access or use our Services. This includes re-registering with us or accessing our Services through use of a different account name or otherwise.

**VSCO Account**. To access our Services, you’ll need to create your own VSCO account (“**Account**”). You can customize your Creator profile and your interactions with our Services on your “Account Settings” page. When creating your Account, you must:

* provide and keep updated accurate and complete information;
* keep your Account secure (don’t give others access and use strong and secure passwords);
* notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account; and
* not use another person’s Account without permission.

**Account Ownership**. Aside from the rights you have in your content as described below, your Account is owned by VSCO, which means you have no ownership or other rights in or to your Account.

**Third-Party Accounts**. You can register your Account using a valid third-party account (a “**Third-Party Account**”) through a social sign-on option and by providing us access to such Third-Party Account. If a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable, or our access is terminated by you or the third-party service provider, then your Account and your content in such Third-Party Account will no longer be available through our Services. We aren’t responsible for any content or personal information such third-party service provider may provide us that is in violation of your privacy settings for such accounts.

**Interactions with Other Creators and Their Creator Content**. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Creators and Creator Content. We aren't liable for any interactions between you and other Creators or Creator Content.

**Interactions and Transactions through VSCO Hub.**  If you mark yourself as available or open to work, or otherwise participate in VSCO Hub, you will be included in our search results shared with individuals, businesses, and/or organizations (“**VSCO Hub Customers**”) interested in hiring or commissioning a Creator or licensing Creator Content. You may interact with our VSCO Hub Customers if they reach out to you for business opportunities. You are solely responsible for your interactions and transactions with VSCO Hub Customers, and we aren’t liable for your conduct or the conduct of any VSCO Hub Customer. VSCO does not negotiate, enforce, mediate, or otherwise participate in any agreement between you and a VSCO Hub Customer, and is not responsible for any disputes between you and a VSCO Hub Customer.

**Changes to Our Services**. We reserve the right to change our Services, including the availability of certain features and the pricing for our Services, at any time at our sole discretion.

2\. YOUR CREATOR CONTENT
------------------------

We are a creator-centric platform and we respect creator rights to the content you and others create. These Terms provide us certain license rights to the content you create, post, or distribute on our Services so we can provide and promote our Services and business (for example, feature your content on our website, our VSCO Collection, and/or in VSCO Challenges or share on our social channels) to you and others. You are responsible for your content and actions on our Services. Be respectful and responsible.

**Creator Content**. Our Services allow Creators to post, publish, submit, upload, share, or otherwise make available on our Services content, such as profile pictures, data, photos, images, music, videos, comments, questions, messages, works of authorship and other content or information, and you may also provide similar content as a part of our Member Stories or Creator Sessions programs, or similar programs involving the promotion or featuring of Creators (all of which we refer to as “**Creator Content**”). You own your Creator Content that you post on our platform. The ownership and licensing of your Creator Content that you create pursuant to a transaction with a VSCO Hub Customer will be determined by your own separate agreement with any VSCO Hub Customer.

**License You Grant to Us**. By using our Services, you grant us a royalty-free, sublicensable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, translate, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of your Creator Content, including the name, image, voice, and/or likeness of any individual included in your Creator Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or developed in the future, in connection with our Services and our business. By submitting your Creator Content to any forums, comments, or any other area on our Services, you consent to us identifying you by your VSCO username (which may be a pseudonym) in connection with your Creator Content. You waive any moral or other author’s rights you may have in connection with any of these uses of your Creator Content.

**License Grant to Other Creators**. You grant each Creator a non-exclusive license to access your Creator Content through our Services and to use, reproduce, distribute, display, make derivative works of, and perform such Creator Content as permitted by our Services and this Agreement, solely for non-commercial purposes. No Creator is granted any rights to use another Creator’s Creator Content, in any manner, for commercial purposes.

**Anti-Piracy Enforcement.** VSCO strives to be a place where creativity flourishes. To that end, we’re committed to protecting the intellectual property of VSCO and our Creators. To enable this protection, you authorize VSCO and our anti-piracy service providers (such as law firms) as your agents for the purpose of enforcing your intellectual property rights in your Creator Content. You grant VSCO and our anti-piracy service providers authority to send or file notices on your behalf to enforce your intellectual property rights in your Creator Content. However, you understand that we aren’t obligated to take such action.

**Creator Promotion**. If you participate in our Pro Spotlights or Creator Sessions or similar programs involving the promotion or featuring of Creators (all of which, we refer to as “**Creator Promotion**”), you grant us the right and license to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, publicity rights, privacy rights, persona, performance, recordings, biographical information, indicia of identity, and logos associated with you, as well as any of your Creator Content, in connection with your Creator Promotion.

**No Storage**. We aren’t obligated to store any of your Creator Content posted to our Services. If your Account is closed, inactive, or suspended for an extended period of time, we may permanently delete your Account or your Creator Content in accordance with our general business practices.

#### 3\. CONTENT MODERATION AND ENFORCEMENT

**Community Guidelines**. Follow our [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community-guidelines) at all times. Don’t post, share, or distribute your Creator Content or take any action using our Services that violate our guidelines or your Account may be temporarily or permanently suspended, and/or your Creator Content may be deleted. We have the right to remove any Creator Content that we believe, in our discretion, violates these Terms or our [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community-guidelines), or is otherwise inappropriate for our Services. In some cases, we also have an obligation to report any content or conduct that is illegal to the appropriate authorities.

**Rights and Permissions**. If you post, share, or distribute any Creator Content, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and permissions in your Creator Content for it to be used in accordance with these Terms without violating the rights of others, including all necessary rights and permissions under any: (a) performance, mechanical, and sound recording rights in musical compositions and sound recordings included in your Creator Content; (b) rights of privacy or publicity with respect to the name, image, and likeness of any individual included in your Creator Content; and (c) moral, droit moral, or authors rights to works of authorship included in your Creator Content. All Creator Content is subject to our [**DMCA Policy**](https://vsco.co/about/contact/copyright).

**Responsibility for Your Creator Content**. You are solely responsible for your Creator Content and any issues that may result from your posting of your Creator Content. You acknowledge that Creator Content you post on our Services is generally made public and can be seen and used by us and others, unless otherwise allowed by our Services. We have no obligation to review or monitor your Creator Content.

**Content Moderation**. We support the freedom of our Creators to express themselves, and, as a result, do not conduct generalized monitoring of all Creator Content. However, we may use tools to proactively detect certain content. For example, we use classifiers to proactively detect illegal content and content that violates our policies, including as set forth in our [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community-guidelines). Creators can report Creator Content posted by other Creators. More information on our reporting and enforcement process is available on our [Safety Center](https://vsco.co/safety).

**Recommender Systems**. We use recommender systems to support your creative journey and help you build your community, some examples are: we suggest Creators who we think you are likely to follow based on who you already follow, to present Creator Content that we think you would be inspired by, recommend presets and other editing tools for a specific piece of content, and suggest creators and content for VSCO Hub Customers. This [Help Center Article](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/24820503424141-European-Union-Digital-Services-Act-Article-27-Disclosure) (How VSCO's Search and Recommender Systems Work) contains more details about these recommender systems.

**Suspensions**. If we suspend your account due to a violation of these Terms, including our [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community_guidelines), this action will be permanent, unless and until you make a successful appeal.

#### 4\. YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR SERVICES

You have a limited right to use our Services on your devices. From time to time, we may also give you access to Beta Services (defined below).

**VSCO Services**. Subject to these Terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use our Services on your devices for your personal and internal use only as intended and as allowed by our Services. To use our websites or mobile apps, you must have a compatible device. We may from time to time require you to upgrade your version of our mobile app. In all instances, we (or our third-party partners) keep all right, title, and interest in our websites and mobile app (including all copies).

**Beta Services**. We may offer certain Services that allow you to access and use certain features, technologies, and/or services that are not yet commercially released, including demonstrations and previews of pre-alpha or beta products (collectively, our “**Beta Services**”). You have a limited license to use any Beta Services we make available to you, which will automatically terminate upon the release of a generally commercially available version of the Beta Services or whenever we determine (“**Beta Period**”). We may revoke or modify access to any Beta Services at any time for any reason. Our Beta Services (including any information or data about or relating to them), and your beta test results or feedback are our confidential information (our “**Beta Confidential Information**”). If you use any of our Beta Services, you agree: (a) to keep all Beta Confidential Information strictly confidential; (b) not to use any such information for your own use or for any purpose outside of those allowed by us, and (c) to promptly delete and destroy all such information, upon our request or upon expiration of any Beta Period.

#### 5\. VSCO’S PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

We own rights in and to all of our VSCO Property and VSCO Marks. Do not use these without our permission. Also, if you give us ideas related to our Services or business, you grant us the right to use them, including incorporating them into our Services and business.

**VSCO Property**. Except for Creator Content, our Services and all associated materials and intellectual property rights, including software, images, text, photos, audio, videos, music and VSCO Marks (“**VSCO Property**”) are our or (our licensors’) exclusive property. To be clear, other Creators own their own Creator Content, and you own your Creator Content. Except for the specific licenses we grant you under these Terms, we are not providing or granting you licenses to any intellectual property rights. Use of VSCO Property for any purpose not specifically allowed by these Terms is strictly prohibited. Visual Supply Company, VSCO, and all related graphics, logos, service marks and trade names used on or in connection with our Services (“**VSCO Marks**”) are our trademarks.

**Feedback**. You may choose to, or we may invite you to submit feedback, comments, suggestions, or improvements about us, our Services, our Beta Services, or our other products or services (“**Feedback**”), such as by participating in a voluntary creator research discussion. If you choose to participate or otherwise provide Feedback, you grant us a royalty-free, sublicensable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use or otherwise legally exploit any Feedback as we see fit without restriction. You agree to keep all information about VSCO (such as our future product plans) that you may receive in connection with any research discussion strictly confidential and, if asked, to return or delete all such confidential information. We may record you during the research discussion to save time and to better understand your Feedback. You give us consent to record your image, voice, likeness and activities during your participation in the research discussion through photographs, videos, audio recordings, written notes, and/or any other method. You agree that VSCO exclusively owns such recordings and is free to use them for research, development, or other similar purposes without restriction. If we wish to use your name or likeness for any external marketing purposes, we will ask for your consent at that time.

#### 6\. PAID SERVICES

Certain products or services offered on or through our Services, such as presets, features, and storage of Creator Content, may be provided for a fee or other charge, such as a VSCO membership (each a **“Subscription”**). If you purchase a Subscription, it will automatically renew until it is canceled by you. As a part of our Services, we may also offer monetization products or services, including the ability to allow certain Creators to exchange payments with others on our platform.

**Fees**. You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account according to the billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due. You may download or purchase our Services from an approved third-party mobile application store or website (“**App Marketplace**”). We may add new products and services for additional fees or change fees for existing products and services at our discretion. Any changes to our prices and billing methods will be effective immediately upon posting of a notice on our Services or by email delivery to you. Any increased fees for existing Subscriptions will apply only to future charges beginning on your next billing period.

**Payment**. You may need to provide us, our third-party payment service provider, or the App Marketplace with valid credit card information, PayPal account, or other permitted payment method (“**Payment Information**”). You authorize us, our third-party payment service provider, or the App Marketplace to charge your Payment Information for all amounts due and payable for the products and services you purchase from us. Upon your Subscription renewal, if we, our payment processor, or the relevant App Marketplace does not receive payment via your Payment Information, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon request. We or the App Marketplace may either cancel or suspend your Subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Information until payment is processed.

**Automatic Subscription Renewals**. Subscription fees will be billed by us or the App Marketplace at the start of your Subscription or at the end of any free trial period (as applicable), and will renew in accordance with the Subscription terms you selected at purchase. The timing of billing may change at any time. **After your initial or subsequent Subscription period, your Subscription will automatically renew on the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional similar period at our then-current price. Your Account will continue to be charged for automatic renewals (even if you terminate your Account), unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the Renewal Commencement Date** .

**Canceling Your Subscription**. You can cancel your Subscription or opt out of any auto-renewal of your Subscription at any time in the manner described at the link [**here**](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/115005759406-How-to-manage-cancel-or-request-a-refund-for-your-VSCO-Membership). Cancellation of your Subscription will be effective at the end of your then-current Subscription term, and your Subscription will not be renewed after your then-current Subscription term. You will not be eligible for a refund for any prorated fees you paid for the then-current Subscription term.

**Free Trials**. Certain Subscription offers may include a free trial prior to processing any charges. We will communicate the trial period to you via our Services. If you decide to cancel your Subscription before we attempt to charge your authorized payment method, you must cancel your Subscription before the free trial ends. If you do not cancel before this time, you are responsible for payment for the full Subscription period.

**App Marketplace Refunds**. Instructions on how to cancel a free trial, cancel an active Subscription, or request a refund for your Subscription from Apple, Google or other App Marketplace are provided [**here**](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/115005759406-How-to-manage-cancel-or-request-a-refund-for-your-VSCO-Membership). We do not control and are unable to provide refunds for Subscriptions purchased through App Marketplaces.

**Payment Service Provider**. All financial transactions related to our Services will be processed by our third-party payment service provider for online payments, or by the App Marketplace or its third-party payment service provider, in each case according to their respective terms and conditions. We aren’t responsible in any event for the actions or inactions of the App Marketplace or any third-party payment service provider, including system downtime or payment service outages, and any billing and fee disputes may require resolution between you and the App Marketplace or applicable third party directly.

**Monetization Features**. From time to time, our Services may provide monetization products or features, including products or features that enable eligible Creators to exchange payments with others on our platform and/or allow Creators or third parties to engage Creators for creative services. These features, their usage, and the payment and receipt of such amounts will be governed by any supplemental terms that we update or provide from time to time. Any compensation for your activities on VSCO Hub will be solely determined between you and any VSCO Hub Customer with whom you enter into an agreement.

**Taxes**. We, or the App Marketplace, may charge you, and you agree to pay, for any fees and applicable taxes related to your Account or your use of our Services. If we determine we have a legal obligation to collect applicable taxes from you, we will collect them in addition to your Subscriptions payment. Additionally, you are solely responsible for paying all taxes that may apply to you resulting from any transactions between you and any VSCO Hub Customer.

#### 7\. THIRD-PARTY LINKS

From time to time, we, or other Creators, may include third-party links or integrations on our Services, or provide plug-ins from third-party services that link back to our Services (“**Third-Party Links**”). We do not control and are not responsible for third-party products, services, or content made accessible via those Third-Party Links. By accessing any such Third-Party Links, you agree to be bound by such third party’s terms and conditions. Find more information about our Product Partnerships [here](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/24098245405197-VSCO-Product-Partnerships).

#### 8\. INDEMNITY

You are responsible for all your activities while using our Services, including what you copy, share, upload, download, attach, send, receive, and record and any harmful or unlawful content or conduct. You will also be liable for any related costs, damages, or other effects.

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our subsidiaries, and other affiliated companies, and our respective subsidiaries, employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from: (a) your use of and access to our Services; (b) your violation of this Agreement or our [Community Guidelines](https://vsco.co/about/community_guidelines); (c) any damage or violation of any third-party right, including rights of publicity, privacy or intellectual property right caused by you or your Creator Content; (d) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation;  (e) your use of or access to any Third-Party Links or your dealings with such third parties; or (f) your interactions with a VSCO Hub Customer.

#### 9\. NO WARRANTY

Our Services (including Beta Services) are provided to you on an “as is” and “as available” basis, and they may be interrupted or unavailable at times.

**You expressly understand and agree that to the extent permitted by law, your use of our Services is at your sole risk. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through our Services will create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.**

**Without limiting the foregoing, we (including our subsidiaries and licensors) do not warrant that any VSCO Property, our Services, or Creator Content is accurate, reliable, or correct; that our Services will meet your requirements or will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that our Services are free of viruses or other harmful components. We do not guarantee any results from your use of the Services, including any participation in VSCO Hub. Any content you obtain through our Services is at your own risk.**

#### 10\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

We are responsible only to the limited extent specifically stated in these Terms for any damages that occur from your use of our Services.

**Exclusion of Liability**. **In no event will we (including our affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers, or licensors) be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages you might experience from our Services, including damages for loss of profits, lost business opportunities, reputation, loss of data, or any theory of liability.**

**Limitation on Damages**. **In no event will we (including our affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers, or licensors) be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding amounts you paid to us during the 12 months preceding the events giving rise to the claim or US $100.00, whichever is greater.**

**Basis of the Bargain**. **The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between you and VSCO. This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.**

#### 11\. TERM AND TERMINATION

You can terminate your Account whenever you choose. We may terminate your Account at any time for any reason. Termination of your Account does not cancel your Subscription. If your Account is terminated by you or by us, you must separately terminate your Subscription in the manner described [**here**](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/115005759406-How-to-manage-cancel-or-request-a-refund-for-your-VSCO-Membership).

**Term**. These Terms apply beginning on the date you first used our Services or the date you accepted these Terms, whichever came first, and will continue to apply until terminated.

**Termination of Services by VSCO**. We may terminate this Agreement or your ability to access or use any or all of our Services at any time for any reason, including if payment cannot be charged to your Payment Information for any reason, if you have violated these Terms, or if we are legally required to do so.

**Termination by You**. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you can do so by taking the following steps:

* notify us at any time to [**https://support.vsco.co**](https://support.vsco.co/);
* cancel all Subscriptions by following the process described [here](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/115005759406-How-to-manage-cancel-or-request-a-refund-for-your-VSCO-Membership); and
* terminate your Account for all our Services that you use.

**Survival**. All provisions of this Agreement that need to continue will continue following the termination of this Agreement, including ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, arbitration and governing law, and limitations of liability.

#### 12\. INFORMAL CLAIM RESOLUTION

**Informal Claim Resolution First**. VSCO is committed to creating a creator-first experience. We want to work with you to resolve any disputes relating to these Terms or our Services informally. Before pursuing formal resolution of any dispute, you agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes by contacting "VSCO Legal Department: Claims Resolution," by mail to 548 Market Street, Suite 92958, San Francisco, California 94104-5401. You must include information about the nature of your claim, the amount involved, if any, and the remedies you are seeking. We both agree to use good faith and reasonable commercial efforts to resolve any such claims. If the dispute is not resolved within 60 days from the date we receive your notice, you may seek relief through binding arbitration.

#### 13\. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

**Please read the following arbitration agreement ("Arbitration Agreement") carefully. This section provides that you and VSCO agree to resolve all disputes between us through binding arbitration and includes a class action and jury waiver. This agreement supersedes all prior versions.**

**Arbitration Notice and Agreement.** This Arbitration Agreement requires you to arbitrate disputes between you and VSCO, which means you will only be able to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an individual basis through arbitration. You are also waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial. This Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply even if you delete, or we suspend or terminate, your Account.

**Applicability of Arbitration Agreement**. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of our Services, to any products sold or distributed through our Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with us, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you and VSCO can seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents), any illegal or intentional act affecting the accessibility, functionality, or the security of our Services, and/or any illegal or intentional act against your interests or VSCO's general business interests. **This Arbitration Agreement applies, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that originated before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement**. You agree to this Arbitration Agreement as a condition of your use (or continued use) of our Services every time it is changed or updated.

**Arbitration Rules and Forum**. The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) (“**FAA**”), including its procedural provisions, in all respects, applies to the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding after complying with the informal dispute resolutions provided above, you must send a Demand for Arbitration, including a copy of these Terms and a description of your dispute to New Era ADR at [app.neweraadr.com](https://app.neweraadr.com/), with copies to (1) VSCO at disputes@vsco.co, and (2) our registered agent at CT Corp, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801.

The following rules and procedures shall apply to any arbitration proceeding brought under these Terms:

* Arbitrations will be administrated by New Era ADR in accordance with their Virtual Expedited Arbitration Rules and Procedures as well as any applicable General Rules and Procedures, except as modified by these Terms. New Era ADR's Virtual Expedited Arbitration Rules and Procedures and General Rules and Procedures are both available at [www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures.](http://www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures)
* The arbitration will be conducted by a professional arbitrator(s) with substantial experience in resolving commercial disputes. The arbitrator will be selected pursuant to New Era ADR’s standard rank and strike process as described in New Era ADR’s General Rules and Procedures.  
    
* If a claim seeks equitable relief (including injunctive relief), the arbitrator will bifurcate the proceeding and rule on liability first, before conducting any proceedings (including discovery) related to the appropriate relief.
* Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the arbitration proceeding and all records pertaining to it, including but not limited to any documents prepared or produced in connection with the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and/or the arbitration award, will be confidential and will not be disclosed to any third party, except to obtain court confirmation of any arbitration award as needed.
* Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**Arbitration Fees**. If VSCO is initiating an arbitration against you, VSCO will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you are initiating an arbitration against VSCO, you will be responsible for the nonrefundable initial filing fee. If, however, the amount of the initial filing fee is more than you would have to pay to file a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (or, for cases where that court would lack original jurisdiction, the California Superior Court, County of San Francisco), VSCO will pay the difference between the initial filing fee and the amount you would have to pay to file a complaint in Court. VSCO will pay both parties’ administrative fee. Otherwise, New Era ADR sets forth fees for its services, which are available at [https://www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures/](https://www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures/).

**Authority of Arbitrator**. The New Era ADR arbitrator(s) assigned to or chosen for your dispute will have exclusive authority to: (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration proceeding will decide each of your and VSCO’s rights and liabilities, if any. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated or joined with any other matters or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions resolving any claim, to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement, including injunctive relief. The arbitrator will issue a written award and decision describing the essential findings and conclusions underlying any award, including the calculation of any damages. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon both you and VSCO.

**Waiver of Jury Trial**. You and VSCO both waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury, with the exceptions stated in this Arbitration Agreement. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and VSCO each waive any right to a jury trial. An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court and must follow our Arbitration Agreement as a court would.

**Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief**. All disputes, claims, and requests for relief within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class or collective basis. Only individual relief is available. Claims of more than one Creator cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of another Creator. If the arbitrator issues a decision that enforcement of these provisions is not applicable to a specific dispute, claim or request for relief, then only those specific issues will be removed and brought into the state or federal courts of the State of California.

**30-Day Right to Opt Out**. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to [opt-out@vsco.co](mailto:opt-out@vsco.co), within 30 days after you create your Account or continue using your Account after receiving notice of this Arbitration Agreement. Maintaining your Account requires you to read and accept these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your VSCO username (if any), the email address used to set up your Account, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other agreements that you currently have with us, including the rest of these Terms, or may enter in the future with us.
