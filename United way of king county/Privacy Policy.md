Privacy Policy
==============

United Way of King County has strict privacy practices. No personal information is sold, rented or traded to third parties.

Unless you choose to donate anonymously, your name, contact information and amount of gift will be relayed to the nonprofit organization to which you make a donation. This information will enable the organization to acknowledge your donation directly and to send you follow-up information about their programs. Although we encourage agencies to set high privacy standards, we do not control their policies, and we therefore cannot take responsibility for their use of donor contact information.

If you do not wish to be contacted by the agency to which you are donating, you have the option to make your donation anonymously, in which case neither your name nor any other information about you will be transmitted to the recipient nonprofit organization. You will still receive an acknowledgement of your gift from United Way of King County, and your gift will remain tax deductible to the extent permitted by law.
