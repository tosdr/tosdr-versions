Acceptable Use Policy
=====================

### Acceptable Use Policy

Mac Mini Vault provides colocation and dedicated server services on the Internet. Mac Mini Vault has certain legal and ethical responsibilities regarding the use of its computer network and equipment involved in these services.

Mac Mini Vault’s general policy is to act as a neutral provider of access to the global Internet. Mac Mini Vault has specific ethical concerns regarding the use of its computers detailed below. Mac Mini Vault reserves the right to suspend or cancel a customer’s access to any or all services provided by Mac Mini Vault when Mac Mini Vault decides that the account has been inappropriately used.

Mac Mini Vault will strongly react to any use or attempted use of an Internet account or computer without the owner’s authorization. Such attempts include “social engineering” (tricking other people into releasing their passwords), password cracking, security hole scanning etc.

Any unauthorized use of accounts or computers by a Mac Mini Vault customer, whether or not the attacked account or computer belongs to Mac Mini Vault, will result in action against the attacker. Possible actions include warnings, account suspension or cancellation, and civil or criminal legal action, according to the seriousness of the attack.

We do not allow the following activities on our network: running a DHCP server, bonjour advertising, using unassigned IP addresses.

[Hosting of bees or practicing any type of beekeeping within the data center is strictly prohibited.](http://xkcd.com/1439/ "also no dogs are allowed to play baseball inside the data center.")

### Data

It is the customer’s responsibility to maintain a current backup of their colocated Mac mini. Mac Mini Vault can assist with various methods of backup and advise customers on best practices.

### Bandwidth Usage

Our service can be divided into two bandwidth tiers. In our “Core” package we allow customers to transfer up to 500GB of data in a month and hold a sustained transfer speed of 15Mbps. This package is burstable to 1000Mbps for short moments. Our “Enterprise” colocation package and dedicated mini rentals are advertised as Unlimited. The limiting factors are the connection on the other end of the transfer and the Mac mini itself. What we mean by Unlimited, is that we will not cap your port speed or charge overages fees. Other violations of the AUP may be grounds for termination regardless of bandwidth utilization.

Unregulated bandwidth allows customers to burst to Unlimited speeds without fears of being charged overages. Constant heavy usage, transferring large amounts of data (5TB+ month after month), and disrupting service for others may be grounds for suspending or canceling service.

### Commercial advertisements with e-mail

Mac Mini Vault customers are prohibited from sending unsolicited commercial advertisements in e-mail. Sending unsolicited commercial advertisements via e-mail will likely result in account suspension or cancellation. Listing of IP addresses in spam blacklists like Spamhaus are grounds for suspension or termination of service.

Sending a message, especially an advertisement, to more than five recipients, is by itself spamming unless the individuals have specifically requested to be added to a mailing list on that topic.

### Cancellation

Mac Mini Vault reserves the right to cancel service at any time. All fees paid in advance of cancellation will be pro-rated and paid by Mac Mini Vault if Mac Mini Vault institutes its right of cancellation. If cancellation is caused by customers violation of these policies, then no refund is due.

Customers can cancel service any time and be refunded any amount exceeding the pre-payment of the current month. For example, if you have paid for 12 months, and cancel in the middle of month five, the last six months would be refunded to you. Due to security concerns, all account cancellations must be done in writing via email or support ticket that includes the primary contact of the account, account name, and reason for cancellation. Payment will be made by company check within 15 days of receipt of cancellation or credit card return. The account will be canceled at the end of the current billing period, unless a date of cancellation is specified.

Mac mini units purchased from Mac Mini Vault will not be shipped to customers within the first 90 days from the date when the Mac mini has been paid in full. If a cancellation comes in during the first 90 days, the unit will be held and shipped back after the 90 days has passed.

Customers canceling a ‘Rent2Own’ Mac mini prior to making 12 full payments will forfeit all Rent2Own and Upgrade costs. After making 12 full payments the Mac mini becomes the property of the customer.

Customers are to disable ‘Find My Mac’ if enabled and remove the Mac mini from their iCloud account if they are canceling a Rent2Own or dedicated Mac mini that they do not own. Using [iCloud to remotely ‘erase’ the machine](https://www.macminivault.com/wp-content/uploads/icloud-erase.png) will actually place an iCloud lock firmware lock on the machine. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THIS ERASE FUNCTION. There will be $250 unlock fee charged to customers who use the remote erase/lock function. The hard drive in the Mac mini will be erased or replaced before the machine is used for any other purposes.

There will be a $250 unlock fee charged to customers who set a firmware password on a Rent2Own or dedicated Mac mini that they do not own if the password is not removed before cancellation.
