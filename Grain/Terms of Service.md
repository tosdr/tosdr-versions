3.2 Grain will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Your Data. These safeguards include encryption of Your Data in transmission, except for certain Other Services that do not support encryption, which You may link to through Service at Your election.

Your Data is currently hosted by Grain or its authorized service partners in data centers located in the United States.

**6\. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS**

6.1 Unless otherwise indicated on a Form referencing these Terms and subject to Section 6.2, all charges associated with Your access to and use of the Service (“Subscription Charges”) are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term. If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or charges for other services indicated on any Form referencing these Terms within five (5) days of Our notice to You that payment is due or delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of the Service by You, Users and End-Users.

In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such Subscription Upgrades.

6.3 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to downgrade Your Service Plan.

Grain uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Grain.

**7\. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION**

7.1 Either You or Grain may elect to terminate Your Account and subscription to the Service as of the end of your then-current Subscription Term by providing notice, in accordance with these Terms, on or prior to the date thirty (30) days preceding the end of such Subscription Term. Unless Your Account and subscription to the Service is so terminated, Your subscription to the Service will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term. Unless otherwise provided for in any Form, the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subscription to the Service for any such subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the Service Plan to which You have subscribed as of the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences.

7.2 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term. Following the termination or cancellation of Your subscription to the Service and/or Account, We reserve the right to delete all Your Data in the normal course of operation. Your Data cannot be recovered once Your Account is canceled.

7.3 If You terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term or We effect such termination or cancellation pursuant to Section 2.5(c) or 7.4, in addition to other amounts You may owe Grain, You must immediately pay any then unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder of such Subscription Term.

7.4 Grain reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the Service (or any part thereof), Your Account or Your and/or Users’ and/or End-Users’ rights to access and use the Service, and remove, disable and discard any of Your Data if We believe that You, Users or End-Users have violated these Terms. This includes the removal or disablement of Your Data. Unless legally prohibited from doing so, Grain will use commercially reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to notify You when taking any of the foregoing actions. Grain shall not be liable to You, Users, End-Users or any other third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuation of Your rights to access and use the Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity by You, Users or End-Users may be referred to law enforcement authorities at Our sole discretion.

**8\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES**

THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND GRAIN EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GRAIN DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM GRAIN OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

**9\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

9.1 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THESE TERMS, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY SUCH PARTY OR THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES.

9.2 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, GRAIN’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSCRIPTION TO, OR USE OR EMPLOYMENT OF THE SERVICE, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES PAID BY YOU DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 10.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF GRAIN WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. GRAIN HAS RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE YOU THE RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS.

9.3 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, GRAIN’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

**10\. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS**

10.1 You may not, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, assign all or any part of these Terms or Your rights under these Terms or delegate performance of Your duties under these Terms without Grain’s prior consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without Your consent, assign Our agreement with You in connection with any merger or change of control of Grain or the sale of all or substantially all of Our assets provided that any such successor agrees to fulfill its obligations pursuant to these Terms. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, these Terms will be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

10.2 These Terms, together with any Form(s), constitute the entire agreement and supersede any and all prior agreements between You and Grain with regard to the subject matter hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional terms may apply to certain features or functionality Grain offers through the Service (the “Additional Terms”). In those instances, We will notify You of such Additional Terms prior to the activation of these features or functionality and the activation of these features or functionality in Your Account will be considered acceptance of the Additional Terms. All such Additional Terms will be considered incorporated into these Terms when You or any User designated as an administrator on your Account activates the feature or functionality. Where there’ is a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control.

10.3 Grain may elect to change or supplement the terms of this Agreement from time to time at its sole discretion. Grain will exercise commercially reasonable business efforts to provide notice to You of any material changes to this Agreement. Grain’s failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms.

**11\. SEVERABILITY**

If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect.

**12\. EXPORT COMPLIANCE AND USE RESTRICTIONS**

The Service and other Software or components of the Service which Grain may provide or make available to You, Users or End-Users may be subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws. You agree to comply with all such laws and regulations as they relate to access to and use of the Service, Software and such other components by You, Users and End-Users.

You represent, warrant and covenant that (i) You are not named on any U.S. government list of persons or entities prohibited from receiving U.S. exports, or transacting with any U.S. person, (ii) You are not a national of, or a company registered in, any Prohibited Jurisdiction, (iii) You shall not permit Users or End-Users to access or use the Service in violation of any U.S. or other applicable export embargoes, prohibitions or restrictions, and (iv) You shall comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States and the country in which You, Users and End-Users are located.

**13\. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES**

The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties.

**14\. SURVIVAL**

Sections 1, 3, 4 and 8-19 shall survive any termination of our agreement with respect to use of the Service by You, Users or End-Users. Termination of such agreement shall not limit Your or Grain’s liability for obligations accrued as of or prior to such termination or for any breach of these Terms.

**15\. NOTICE**

All notices to be provided by Grain to You under these Terms may be delivered in writing (i) by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or US mail to the contact mailing address provided by You on any Form; or (ii) electronic mail to the electronic mail address provided for Your Account owner.

**17\. GOVERNING LAW**

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of laws principles. You hereby expressly agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the State of California, San Mateo County, for the purpose of resolving any dispute relating to the Terms or access to or use of the Service by You, Users or End-Users.

**18\. ARBITRATION**

You agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Grain arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Grain as a user of the Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Grain further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.
