#### CobbleStone Systems Corp. DBA: CobbleStone Software

**Last Updated: July 9th, 2024**

CobbleStone Software ("CobbleStone," “we,” “us,” “our”) takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy explains CobbleStone’s handling processes regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that you may provide to us through using this website (www.cobblestonesoftware.com) (the “Website”), by using any of our products or services such as our Contract Insight® software (“Software”), or engaging with us in other ways (collectively with the Website and Software, the “Services”).  

Please keep reading below for answers to any questions you may have about our data privacy practices. If your question is not addressed in this policy, please contact us for more information.  

**What information does CobbleStone collect?** 
-----------------------------------------------

CobbleStone may collect personal information from you when you use our Services.

We may also use cookies to keep track of visitors (a cookie is a small file stored on the hard drive of your personal computer). If your web browser allows, you may disable the placement of cookies on your hard drive. Disabling the placement of cookies may prevent you from accessing or using portions of the site. Additionally, our Website generates server log files automatically. These log files are used to generate statistical information and error reports to ensure the Website runs with minimum disruption and for security purposes. The log files may actively be used to identify individual visitors.

CobbleStone also provides many choices about the use, disclosure, storage, and other processing of your personal information, such as:

**Will CobbleStone share my personal information with others?** 
----------------------------------------------------------------

CobbleStone does not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with any third parties except in limited circumstances, such as to process user activities, communicate with you about our products and services, or as required by laws or regulations. CobbleStone may share personal information with third parties acting as our agents to provide the best products and services to our users. 

CobbleStone complies with applicable data protection law for all onward transfers of personal information, including the requirements and liability provisions in the Data Privacy Framework explained below. 

**How long will CobbleStone keep my personal information?**  
-------------------------------------------------------------

Your personal information is kept as necessary to fulfill our contracts, interact with you, adhere to government regulations, and provide for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. We will keep your personal data only for as long as necessary, as determined in the applicable governing documents or law, to perform the services on behalf of our clients and complete the purposes for which the information has been acquired. The information will be retained until deleted by us or as requested by the data owner. You may request the deletion of your data at any time. 

**Will CobbleStone transfer my data across borders?** 
------------------------------------------------------

CobbleStone may transfer personal information outside the countries where we and our clients are located. This includes transfers to countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and to countries that may not have laws that provide the same degree of protection for personal information as your home country. In accordance with applicable legal requirements, we take appropriate measures to facilitate adequate protection for any information so transferred. 

Where we transfer personal information outside of the EEA to a country or framework not determined by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, the transfers will have protective measures, such as standard contractual clauses. The European Commission approved standard contractual clauses are at [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en).  

CobbleStone also adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  

**Does CobbleStone comply with the Data Privacy Framework?**  
--------------------------------------------------------------

CobbleStone complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  CobbleStone has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  CobbleStone has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).  

In compliance with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles, CobbleStone commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to the DPF Principles.  European Union, Swiss and United Kingdom individuals with DPF inquiries or complaints should first contact CobbleStone’s IT Security Group at ITSG@CobbleStoneSoftware.com. 

CobbleStone has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the DPF Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, Data Privacy Framework Services, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/dpf-consumers/ProcessForConsumers](https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/dpf-consumers/ProcessForConsumers) for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you. 

If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.  See [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2). 

**Will this privacy policy change?** 
-------------------------------------

Occasionally, we may update this privacy policy by making material changes (such as to address new or modified laws, industry practices, or business procedures) or minor changes (such as updating an address or fixing a typo). If we do, we will change the “last updated” date at the top of this policy and the most up-to-date policy will be posted to this page. Changes may be made with or without notice, so we encourage you to periodically review this page for updates. CobbleStone may provide notice to you or gain your consent for certain material changes when required by applicable privacy law. Notice may be made by contacting you directing, posting a notice on our products, or by other means allowed by law. Your continued use of the Services after any updates to this policy will constitute your acceptance of the current privacy policy.
