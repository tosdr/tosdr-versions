**Explanation of Applicable Privacy Rights**

Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may have certain rights in relation to your Personal Information, as described below:

* **Right of Access**:  
    * You may ask us to confirm whether we are processing your Personal Information and, if so, details regarding our processing of the Personal Information.
    * You may also request that we provide your Personal Information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format.
* **Right to Delete:** Subject to certain exceptions, you may request that we delete your Personal Information. There are some reasons we will not be able to fully address your request, such as if we need to complete a transaction for you, to detect and protect against fraudulent and illegal activity, to exercise our rights, for our internal purposes, or to comply with a legal obligation.
* **Right to Correct:**  Subject to certain exceptions, you may request that we correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, subject to appropriate verification. We will take commercially reasonable efforts to make the corrections that you request.
* **Right to Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information:**You have the right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information, as such terms are defined in California privacy laws.  This means that, if you opt out, going forward, we will not sell or share your Personal Information with such third parties to use for their purposes, including cross-context behavioral advertising (as defined by California law), unless you later direct us to do so.                                                                                          
    
      
    
    If you are a resident of Connecticut, Colorado, Utah, or Virginia, you may take advantage of certain privacy rights, such as to request access, correction, deletion, or a copy of your Personal Information.  Because we may “sell” Personal Information as such term is defined in Connecticut and Colorado laws, or engage in “targeted advertising” as such term is defined in Connecticut, Colorado, Utah, and Virginia laws, you may also exercise your right to opt-out of such sales or targeted advertising where available.  You have the right to appeal a denial of your privacy rights.
* **Right to Revoke Consent**: We may seek your affirmative consent to process your Personal Information for certain purposes. Where applicable, you may revoke your consent at any time.
* **Right to Limit Certain Processing Activities or to Object to Certain Processing Activities**: Where we have not sought your affirmative consent to process your Personal Information, you may have the right to limit or object to our continued processing of that Personal Information

Where applicable, you also have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.

If you exercise any of the foregoing rights, we will not discriminate against you, including by denying access to our products or services or restricting your access to products or services of a certain quality or price level.

**How to Submit a Request**

To take advantage of your right to know, delete, correct, or portability under California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, or Virginia law, or to submit an appeal of a denial of your privacy rights, please head to [https://us.dollarshaveclub.com/?ketch\_show=preferences](https://us.dollarshaveclub.com/?ketch_show=preferences). You may also contact us by email at [\[email protected\]](https://ask.dollarshaveclub.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), or by mail at Attn: Member Services/Privacy Officer, 13335 Maxella Ave, Marina del Rey, CA 90292.  We may request certain information about your interactions with DSC to verify your identity before we can respond to your access, deletion, correction, or portability requests.  DSC will confirm receipt of your request within 10 business days and will respond to your request within 45 calendar days, after proper verification, unless we need additional time, in which case we will let you know.

To take advantage of your right to opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information or to opt out of targeted advertising, please click on the [Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information link](https://us.dollarshaveclub.com/?ketch_show=preferences) which also is on our website footer or email us at [\[email protected\]](https://ask.dollarshaveclub.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will work to comply with your opt-out request within 15 business days. 

Submitting an opt-out request does not require you to create an account with us.

Alternatively, if you are a California resident, where available, you can use certain preference signals to exercise your sale and sharing opt-out right automatically with all businesses that you interact with online, including DSC Services. If you are a browser-based opt-out preference signal that complies with the CCPA, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC), upon receipt or detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information linked to that browser and any consumer profile we have associated with that browser. Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each one that you use.

We value your privacy and will not discriminate in response to your exercise of your privacy rights.

**Agent Requests**

You may authorize someone to make a privacy rights request on your behalf (an authorized agent). Authorized agents will need to demonstrate that you’ve authorized them to act on your behalf or must demonstrate they have power of attorney pursuant to applicable probate law. DSC retains the right to request confirmation directly from you confirming that the agent is authorized to make such a request, or to request additional information to confirm the agent’s identity. An authorized agent is prohibited from using a consumer’s Personal Information, or any information collected from or about the consumer, for any purpose other than to fulfill the consumer’s requests, for verification, or for fraud prevention.

**California Privacy Rights**

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides California residents with certain rights in relation to their Personal Information.

An authorized agent may also use the methods described above to submit a request to opt out on your behalf if you provide the agent with signed permission to do so. Please note that we may request from the agent documentation demonstrating that they have your authority to act on your behalf.

6. **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EEA, UK, AND SWITZERLAND RESIDENTS**

**Legal Basis for Processing**

Applicable law in certain jurisdictions requires us to set out the “legal basis” that we rely on to collect and use your Personal Information. Where applicable, the legal bases upon which we rely in order to collect and use your personal information can be found below:

Australia: [https://au-help.dollarshaveclub.com/en-US/privacy-policy-205785](https://au-help.dollarshaveclub.com/en-US/privacy-policy-205785)

At any time, you may subject a request to exercise the above-listed rights by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://ask.dollarshaveclub.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). In order to protect your privacy, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. Where applicable, we will use the requested information for verification purposes only  

7. **CHILDREN'S PRIVACY** 

Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. We do not direct the DSC Services to, nor do we knowingly collect any Personal Information from, children under the age of sixteen.  If DSC learns that a child under the age of sixteen has provided Personal Information through the DSC Services, we will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from our files.

8. **SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION** 

We use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information. However, because no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You use the DSC Services and provide us with your information at your own risk.  If we share information with a third party, as detailed in this Privacy Policy, we shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that they keep the information secure and only use the information consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

9. **INFORMATION RETENTION**

We will retain your Personal Information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including to satisfy our legal or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or allowed under law.

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of Personal Information; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information; the purpose for which we use the Personal Information; whether we can achieve the purposes through other means; and the applicable legal requirements.

If we de-identify information, we will maintain and use the information in de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify the information except as required or permitted by law.

  

**10.** ****NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE**** 

We may offer financial incentives to promote our products and services. These may include:

* Razor Rewards, where you earn points for certain actions or purchases. You will receive perks for such point earnings, including, but not limited to:
    * Shipping benefits 
    * Early access to new products 
    * Invites to IRL events
    * Testing new products before launch 
    * Enhanced customer service

We may ask you to provide Personal Information in connection with these promotions, including the following Personal Information: your name, birthday, contact information (such as email address and telephone number), and zip code. Because these promotions involve the collection of Personal Information, they may be interpreted as “financial incentive” programs under California law or “bona fide loyalty programs” under Colorado law. We use this information for the purposes described above under the section titled “HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED,” including for targeted advertising. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in our “DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION” section, including data analytics providers, advertising technology vendors, and social media platforms. 

Participation in any financial incentive is optional. To enroll, please click here [https://us.dollarshaveclub.com/pages/rewards.](https://us.dollarshaveclub.com/pages/rewards)You may withdraw from the program at any time by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://ask.dollarshaveclub.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If you ask us to delete your Personal Information, we will not be able to provide you with access to these programs.

The value of any financial incentive we offer is reasonably related to the value of any Personal Information you provide to us. We estimate the value of your Personal Information by considering, without limitation, the expenses we incur from collecting your Personal Information and/or providing the financial incentive to you, the revenue generated by your use of the financial incentive, and any improvements we can make to our products and services based on aggregating information obtained through the financial incentive program.

Please note that we may provide additional terms that apply to a particular financial incentive. If applicable, those terms will be presented to you at sign up.

  

**11\. OTHER SITES** 

  

The DSC Services may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate. This includes links from service providers, fulfillment companies, advertisers, sponsors, or other business partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement. We are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services, or privacy policies or practices. These other sites may place their own cookies on your Device and independently collect or solicit Personal Information from you. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third parties with which you engage. You should also assess the authenticity of any site which appears or claims that it is one of the DSC Services (including those linked to through an email or social networking page).

  

**12\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS**

  

DSC is a global business and it, or its service providers, may process, transfer and store information about our users on servers located in a number of countries, including the United States. As a result, your Personal Information may be subject to data protection and other laws that differ from those in your country of residence. Additionally, your Personal Information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities or to respond to judicial process in the countries in which we operate. By using the DSC Services, or by providing us with any Personal Information, you are acknowledging that such information may be transferred to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Where applicable, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Information

If you are located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (or other government-approved contracts) or other lawful data transfer mechanisms that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognized as providing an adequate level of protection. To learn more about the cross-border transfer of your Personal Information or the transfer mechanism we use to lawfully carry out such transfers, you can contact us as set forth in the “Contact Information” section below.
