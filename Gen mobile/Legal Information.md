**Sharing With the Primary Account Holder and Third Parties**

Upon proper authentication, Gen Mobile may disclose information to the primary account holder. If the primary account holder is a business, governmental agency, or another individual, Gen Mobile may provide information about your use of the products and/or services at their direction.

We will never sell your name, address, or phone number without your consent to those outside of Gen Mobile to market third-parties' products and/or services. Gen Mobile may use third-party partners for certain business reasons and share information with them as necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. We may also provide certain, anonymized or unidentifiable information about you to third-parties for advertising, marketing, or other purposes. Gen Mobile may also share information with third-parties in order to protect your privacy and security and to enforce our own rights. For such purposes, Gen Mobile will only share your information as needed for those companies or third-party entities to perform specific services. Additionally, those companies are required to protect your information with the same level of protection that Gen Mobile provides. 

We share information beyond Gen Mobile with certain other entities in limited circumstances, such as complying with court orders and other legal and regulatory requirements, responding to 911 and other emergencies; assisting with identity verification and preventing fraud and theft; enforcing our agreements and legal rights, or advancing or defending against legal claims; processing transactions and bills and to collect payments; as part of a corporate business transaction like a merger or acquisition; and/or with your consent. 

**Your Consent Required for Individually Identifiable Disclosures or Information**

Gen Mobile will only disclose information that individually identifies our customers and/or their devices to third-parties with each individual customer consent, which may be obtained in various ways such as in writing, online through click-through agreements, or when you accept the terms and conditions on your device for certain applications or services. Implicit consent will be obtained only in certain situations. Implicit consent can occur when you purchase a mobile device and request that Gen Mobile ship the device to your home, and you implicitly consent to disclose your name and address to a third-party shipping company in order to complete the purchase via delivery. Gen Mobile will not provide listing information for wireless numbers to directory assistance services or phone book publishers without your consent.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We take information security seriously.  We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect information we collect and maintain against loss; misuse; and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  However, even with appropriate security measures in place, we cannot guarantee the security of the information under our control.

If your device is lost or stolen, you may contact Gen Mobile Care to assist with remote location, lockdown, or factory reset of the device.

**Online Privacy Policy for Children**

Gen Mobile does not intentionally or knowingly collect information from, market to, or solicit information online from children under the age of 13 without first obtaining legal guardian or parental consent. Gen Mobile encourages legal guardians or parents to be involved with their children's online activities to ensure no information is collected from a child without legal guardian or parental consent. If a legal guardian or parent authorizes a child to use Gen Mobile’s products and/or services by providing them with a device associated with an active account, any information acquired as a result of such use will be treated as the legal guardian’s or parent’s information in accordance with this Notice.

### **CUSTOMER CHOICE AND CONTROL**

**Accessing Your Information**

Customers can access and modify their account information by contacting Customer Care, using the App or, when available, online at www.genmobile.com.

**Choices Regarding Gen Mobile’s Use of Your Information**

Gen Mobile would like to send you certain marketing communications about products and/or services we provide. You may choose to limit or opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time. To opt out of receiving marketing communications, please call Customer Care and a Gen Mobile representative can process your opt out request. If you opt out from receiving Gen Mobile marketing communications, you will continue to receive certain account and service related communications, such as invoices, customer care notices, and transactional notices when you purchase Gen Mobile products and/or services.

**Consumer Role in Protecting Privacy**

Gen Mobile strongly encourages and recommends our customers to use passwords and security questions to prevent unauthorized access to their account. Create unique, non-obvious passwords and do not share your passwords.

**Do Not Call**

The Federal Trade Commission’s “Do Not Call” laws allow customers to place their telephone numbers on the national Do Not Call Registry in order to prevent telemarketing calls. Please visit www.donotcall.gov for more information. Please note that even if your number is placed on a federal and/or state Do Not Call list, most telemarketing laws permit companies to contact their own customers. If you would like, you may be removed from Gen Mobile’s telemarketing list by contacting Customer Care.

**Consumer Code for Wireless Services (“CCWS”)**

Gen Mobile follows the CCWS established by the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (“CTIA”). CTIA and the wireless carriers adhering to the CCWS have made a voluntary commitment to help consumers make informed choices when selecting their wireless service.

### **IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA PREPAID WIRELESS CUSTOMERS**

**Court Decision**

On November 15, 2018, the United States District Court, Northern District of California (MetroPCS California, LLC v. Michael Picker et al, case number 17-cv-05959-SI), enjoined state agencies from enforcing the provisions of the Prepaid MTS Surcharge Collection Act because it conflicts with federal law. A notice of appeal of the district court’s decision was filed on December 14, 2018, but a judicial stay of the injunction was not requested, thereby ending CDTFA’s enforcement of the Prepaid MTS Surcharge Collection Act (the “Act”). However, the CDTFA will continue to administer the Local Prepaid MTS Collection Act, which is a separate act from the Act.

Effective January 1, 2019, telephone corporations providing prepaid wireless telecommunications services sold in California shall collect, report, and remit surcharges and user fee rates applicable to all intrastate telecommunications services. This will be consistent with the universal surcharge mechanism applicable to all telecommunications carriers in existence prior to the enactment of the Act, including the method of calculating the rates, requirement of revenue reports, and the collection of surcharges and user fees.  

The surcharges and user fee are adjusted periodically and applicable to the sale price of intrastate prepaid wireless services as follows:

* Universal Lifeline Telephone Service (ULTS) – Resolution T-17519
* Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program (DDTP) – Resolution T-17458
* California High Cost Fund-A (CHCF-A) – Resolution T-17453
* California High Cost Fund-B (CHCF-B) – Resolution T-17417
* California Teleconnect Fund (CTF) – Resolution T-17606
* California Advanced Services Fund (CASF) – Resolution T-17593
* California Public Utilities Commission User Fee – Resolution M-4832
* California 911 Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge – Revenue and Taxation Code section 41001
* Local Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services (LPMTS) Surcharge – Revenue and Taxation Code section 42100

Each surcharge and user fee will be listed on your receipt and will vary based on your location because certain cities and counties may or may not implement different LPMTS surcharge rates.  

To better understand your total charges since the invalidation of the Act, here are some examples where you purchase a $25 Gen Mobile Plan (Plan) and are located where the total rate of the surcharges and user fee are 10.0% (these do not include the calculation of LPMTS):

* Before January 1, 2019, the surcharges and user fee collected under the $25 Plan is $25 x 10% = $2.50, for a total charge of $27.50.
* On and after January 1, 2019, the surcharges and user fee collected under the $25 Plan is $5 (voice portion) x 62.9% (inverse of federal safe harbor percentage) x 10% = $0.31, for a total charge of $25.31.

For more information please go to the [CDTFA’s website](https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/prepaid-mts-surcharge.htm) or you may contact Customer Care by calling at 833-528-1380 or dialing 611 from your device on the Gen Mobile network.

### **CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION (“CPNI”) POLICY**

**Your Privacy is Very Important to Gen Mobile**

Gen Mobile is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our customers’ personal information. As your telecommunications service provider, Gen Mobile has access to certain confidential information known as Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI.

**What is CPNI?** 

CPNI is the information generated due to your use of Gen Mobile's telecommunications services. CPNI includes: type of services purchased, how those services are utilized, billing information, and information about call details (also known as “Call Detail Information” or “CDI”). CDI involves information relating to specific calls, including the phone numbers you call, the numbers calling you, call times and dates, call durations, and caller location. Your telephone number, name, or address are not CPNI.

**Federal Law Requires Protection of CPNI**

Gen Mobile may share CPNI within Gen Mobile, including our affiliated companies, in order to communicate with you about your account, to provide services to you, and to develop new products and/or services to provide the best experience possible. Gen Mobile may use your CPNI to offer you additional products and/or services that may be of interest to you. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) requires that we obtain your consent to use your CPNI within Gen Mobile to offer you additional products and/or services. Please know that in compliance with FCC rules and regulations, Gen Mobile will not sell or share your CPNI with anyone outside of Gen Mobile, unless required by law.

**How to Give Consent to Share Your CPNI**

No further action is required to allow Gen Mobile to use your CPNI. We will assume you approve to our sharing of your CPNI within Gen Mobile unless you provide Gen Mobile with notice that you wish to opt out. If you would like to keep your CPNI private and do not wish it to be used for additional marketing purposes, you can opt out of that use. To opt out, you can call Customer Care and speak with a Gen Mobile representative who can process your opt out request. Your decision to allow or restrict Gen Mobile’s use of your CPNI will remain in effect until you change it.

**CDI is only disclosed in certain circumstances**

You can gain access to CDI only in the following scenarios: (a) calling Gen Mobile Customer Care and authenticating your identity as the account owner; (b) requesting the CDI be mailed to the address of record; or (c) requesting a Gen Mobile representative call the telephone number of record for your account to disclose CDI.

**Notification of Account Changes**

Gen Mobile will notify you if any change is made to your account by sending a notice to the address of record, sending an SMS message to the telephone number of record, and/or sending an automated call to the number of record. The notification will not reveal the changed or updated information.

**CPNI Breach Policy**

Gen Mobile is required to notify law enforcement if Gen Mobile becomes aware of a breach of customer CPNI. Gen Mobile will also notify you of the breach following notification to law enforcement unless directed otherwise by the United States Secret Service or the FBI.
