I. INTRODUCTION  

DISH Wireless L.L.C. dba Gen Mobile (“Gen Mobile”) strives to assist law enforcement or governmental entities in their investigations while maintaining its legal obligation to protect customer privacy as required by law and applicable policies. The relevant statutes may include, without limitation: The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522, 2701-2712, 3121-3127); Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (47 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1010); and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (specifically, 47 U.S.C. § 222 pertaining to customer proprietary network information or CPNI). Gen Mobile makes every effort to provide a response within ten (10) business days, unless otherwise specified or required.

**II. INFORMATION REQUESTS**  

Every information request is reviewed and evaluated by a Gen Mobile representative in light of any particular procedural or legal requirements and applicable state and federal laws.

Gen Mobile is generally able to provide the following type of information (if available):

1. Customer’s name
2. Customer’s address
3. Length of service, including start date and last service date, if applicable
4. Customer’s telephone number, device number, or other customer number or identification
5. Call Detail Records (“CDRs”), including local and long distance calling connections
6. Type or types of payment used to purchase service (may be limited to providing the name on the credit/debit card and the last four digits of the card number)

Call Detail Records

Gen Mobile generally archives historical call detail records (“CDRs”) for up to eighteen (18) months. CDRs contain metadata of service usage, including data fields that describe a specific instance of usage, but does not include the content of that usage. For example, a call detail record describing a particular phone call might include the phone numbers of both the calling and receiving parties, the start time, and duration of that call. CDRs include voice, text, and data usage records. In certain circumstances, records beyond eighteen (18) months may be available; however, Gen Mobile may need additional time to properly provide such records.

**A. Emergency Disclosure Requests**

Under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2702(b)(8) and (c)(4), Gen Mobile may disclose customer information to a governmental entity if Gen Mobile believes in good faith that an _emergency situation involving danger of death or serious physical injury may occur_ if the information is not provided quickly.

Emergency Disclosure Requests are only fulfilled if the requestor provides all the information on the Emergency Disclosure Form, which can be found on Gen Mobile’s website at [www.genmobile.com](http://www.genmobile.com/) or attached hereto as **Exhibit A**.

Send a completed and signed **Emergency Disclosure Form, on department letterhead,** (with “Emergency Disclosure Form” in the subject line) to: [genmobilelegal@dish.com](mailto:subpoena@genmobile.com)

**B. Court Orders, Search Warrants, and Subpoenas**

All court orders, search warrants, and subpoenas **must be properly served** either in person at our business office or through our Registered Agent for Service of Process. Improper service may delay release of any information.

**C. Preservation of Records Requests**

Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2703(f) and 2704 allows governmental entities to request that Gen Mobile preserve customer information and data already in its possession, but not on an ongoing, continual basis unless and until a proper legal order is obtained. Gen Mobile will not release any customer information without a proper and valid legal request. The information will be retained for up to ninety (90) days. In the event Gen Mobile does not receive a valid legal request, the information will be kept according to regular business practices.

**D. Other**

Gen Mobile is unable to provide information requests for the following: Interception of Communications, Internet Protocol (IP), Pen Register/Trap, Trace Device, and Wiretaps. Please request such information from the underlying carrier.

Gen Mobile also does not provide customers with email addresses and does not retain customer email content and attachments.

III. CUSTOMER ACCOUNT IDENTIFICATION
