Version October 2023

Welcome to Gen Mobile and thank you for choosing Gen Mobile as your carrier!  Please carefully read these terms and conditions (these “Terms & Conditions”), as they apply to all Gen Mobile devices (each a “Device”), services, and related products or features (collectively, the “Service” or “Services”) that Gen Mobile may provide to you. If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact Gen Mobile Customer Care between 9AM Pacific Time and 5:30PM Pacific Time Monday through Friday by dialing 611 from your Gen Mobile network device or calling 1-833-528-1380.  THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT DISALLOWS CLASS ACTIONS, A CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION, AND A JURY WAIVER PROVISION. IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION.

When we say “we”, “us”, “our” or “Gen Mobile”, we mean DISH Wireless L.L.C. and when we say “you”, “your”, “customer” and “user”, we mean a Gen Mobile account holder or anyone who uses our Devices or Services, including, without limitation, all beneficiaries of this Agreement. 

1. **AGREEMENT.** These Terms & Conditions contain important information about your Service and constitute an agreement between you and Gen Mobile (the “Agreement”). The Agreement is comprised of several components, which may be amended or updated at any time and from time to time in Gen Mobile’s sole and absolute discretion (effective immediately upon posting), including, without limitation: (a) these Terms & Conditions, (b) the Consumer Policies & Privacy Notice, (c) MyGenMobile App End User License Agreement, (d) the Auto Pay Authorization, (e) the International Long Distance (“ILD”) Consumer Agreement, (f) the Global Unlimited Text Messaging, (g) the rate plan that you select when initiating or using the Service (the “Rate Plan”), and (h) other terms, rules, or policies as made available to you from time to time. You (“you”, “your” refers to all users of the Services provided under this Agreement, including all beneficiaries of this Agreement) accept this Agreement when you: (i) activate your Service, (ii) use Gen Mobile’s Service, or (iii) pay for the Service.

BY ACTIVATING AND/OR USING THE SERVICE YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT, DO NOT INITIATE SERVICE OR USE THE SERVICES IN ANY WAY.

BY CLICKING “Pay Now,” PRIOR TO PURCHASING A MOBILE DEVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 911 AND E-911 SERVICES AND E-911 SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH GEN MOBILE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE GEN MOBILE SERVICES.

You represent to Gen Mobile that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and legally able to enter into an agreement. If you are accepting on behalf of an organization, you represent to Gen Mobile that you are an authorized person capable of binding said organization. By activating and/or using the Service, you agree to every provision of this Agreement, whether or not you have read it. Please carefully read this Agreement in its entirety, including the MANDATORY ARBITRATION and the CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions.

This Agreement makes up the complete Agreement between you and Gen Mobile and supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, representations, advertising, contracts, offers, statements, and understandings relating to the contents of this Agreement, whether oral or written, including, but not limited to, all previous versions of the Terms & Conditions. You cannot rely on any other documents or statements by any sales person, service representative, or other agent and you acknowledge and agree that you have not relied on any representation, assertion, contract, guarantee, warranty, or other assurance, stated or made by anyone except those set out in this Agreement.

You agree that all applicable laws and regulations governing Gen Mobile’s Services are incorporated in their entirety by this reference and as if set forth specifically in this Agreement.

You also agree that you are subject to Gen Mobile’s business policies, practices, and procedures, which Gen Mobile can change at any time and from time to time in Gen Mobile’s sole and absolute discretion without notice (collectively, the “Business Policies”).

2. **SERVICES.** Gen Mobile offers nationwide wireless text, voice, and data services. Depending on your Rate Plan, network coverage, and Device and SIM type (5G or 4G LTE capable Device and SIM to access 5G or 4G LTE speeds), data speeds may (but in no event are guaranteed to) reach up to 5G or 4G LTE. Actual availability, network coverage, and speed may vary.

3. **DOMESTIC MINUTES AND MESSAGING.** Domestic airtime and other measured voice usage charges are calculated from when your Device first initiates contact with a network until the network connection is broken, whether or not the connection was successful (i.e. busy signals or unanswered calls). Call times are measured in whole minutes and rounded up to the nearest minute. All phone usage incurs charges, including directory assistance, inbound/outbound calls and messaging, international calls, and voicemail deposits/retrievals. On a call that crosses time periods with different pricing, minutes are charged based on the call start time. Gen Mobile may impose limits on the number of emails, texts, voicemails, or other messages that can be held in your account. Indicators of messages on your Device, including mailbox and text message icons, may not always provide an up-to-date indication of new messages and you may need to manually reset or clear your mailbox and text message indicators. Legitimate messages may be inadvertently interrupted by software aimed at the prevention of unsolicited messages you may have on your Device.

4. **INTERNATIONAL MINUTES**. International long distance services (“ILD Services”) are provided by Elite Telecom, a third party provider. A list of unlimited destinations for ILD Services and the list of rates for international destinations can be found at [this page](https://www.genmobile.com/pages/international-rate-checker).Unlimited destinations are subject to change at any time without prior notice. There are no additional fees or surcharges associated with ILD Services, and ILD Services expire thirty (30) days after activation and/or recharge. To see additional terms and conditions in the ILD Consumer Agreement, go to [this page](https://www.genmobile.com/pages/ILD-consumer-agreement). For more information on international text messaging or Gen Mobile’s Global Unlimited Text Messaging, please go [here](https://www.genmobile.com/pages/international-plans). Gen Mobile offers free international toll limitation on plans that do not have ILD services.

5. **TEXTING AND PICTURE MESSAGING.** Text messages are limited to 160 characters per message, including spaces. Text and picture messages can be sent and received to domestic and certain international destinations. Premium text messaging, if available, may be subject to additional fees. All messages, including text and picture messages, are charged when sent or received, regardless of whether they are read or unsolicited. Regardless of who initiates the activity, Gen Mobile is not responsible for any of the data activity sent or received to your Device. For messages delivered to your Device in multiple segments, you will be charged for each segment of the message received. When a single message is delivered from your Device to multiple recipients, you will be charged for each recipient of the message. Gen Mobile reserves the right to limit picture message size at any time. In order to protect the network, Services or any other business purpose in Gen Mobile’s sole and absolute discretion, Gen Mobile may issue separate charges, limit the amount of data transfer, or otherwise limit or terminate Services. Memory limitations on your Device may prevent some data or content from being stored or properly displayed on your Device. Gen Mobile is not responsible for the failure to store data or content nor the deletion of such data or content. Picture and video messaging consume data and are only available on Devices programmed for such data.

6. **DATA SERVICES.** Your Device may not be able to access data, or you may be charged for data on a pay per use basis unless data Services are included in your Rate Plan. Gen Mobile provides data and messaging Services that may include features that can be used with data Services and wireless content and applications (“Data Services”). Data Services are based on the capabilities and capacity of each Device, and compatible data-enabled wireless Devices are required. Gen Mobile may measure and meter your usage of Data Services depending on your selected Rate Plan. For Data Services with a limit, when you near your data limit, Gen Mobile may send a text message or email to alert you that you are approaching your data limit maximum. Gen Mobile reserves the right at any time to alter the types of usage that are permissible for Data Services. Because the wireless data network capacity is limited, Data Services may only be used for permissible purposes in accordance with this Agreement. Data Services usage includes, but is not limited to, the actual data sent and received along with header packets, overhead, and may include other information sent in connection with a data session where Data Services is used. Usage of Data Services on other carriers’ networks may not be available or may be limited. Charges and availability are based on the location of the cell site receiving and transmitting the Data Services. Your Data Services are intended for web browsing, messaging, taking pictures or video recordings, downloading and playing applications or software, and similar activities on your wireless Device. Data Services may also include, for example, multimedia streaming and video on demand services, as well as certain multimedia uploads, downloads and gaming services and applications. (Uploads are data sessions where the data is transferred from your Device to some other computer or wireless device, while downloads are data sessions where the data is transferred from some other computer or wireless device to your Device.) As between you and Gen Mobile, it is your responsibility to monitor the data use and other uses or access to your Device by children or minors. Data Services do not include any services or uses that violates or are prohibited under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any rule or policy of Gen Mobile. You acknowledge and agree that your Data Services usage may vary depending on certain factors outside of Gen Mobile’s control, including but not limited to the amount of users on the bit rate(s) of your data session; the distance to the serving cell site; the management of backhaul at the serving cell site, any application(s) you are using for your data session; the network congestion; the number of users served by your serving cell site; the screen size of your Device; the type(s) and amount(s) of compression used by the computers or Devices involved in the data session; and any error(s) that might occur in the data session. Gen Mobile may temporarily slow your speed at any time in the event our network is busy, you exceed your allotted Data Services, or your use is deemed unreasonable use and in violation of the Agreement. You may review and assess your Data Services usage during an applicable Service Cycle by checking your MyGenMobile App or calling Customer Care.

7. **DATA MEASUREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS.** Actual data speeds may vary based on location and Device capability. Data Service usage is measured in megabytes (MB), not minutes. Usage rounding occurs at the top of each clock hour while in a session and at the end of each session and is then deducted from your account balance based on the terms of your Rate Plan. Data Service usage will be assessed for all data directed to the internet protocol address assigned to your Device, regardless of who initiates the activity or whether your Device actually receives the data. We may throttle Your Data Service after You exceed the data allotment of or as advertised in Your Rate Plan.  Mobile hotspot, subject to availability, will draw from Your data allotment of or as advertised in Your Rate Plan. 

8. **SERVICE CYCLE.** Each Service Cycle is set for thirty (30) days, and your account will expire if no new or recurring payment is made. You are not entitled to any refund for any portion of your Services that are not used during the Service Cycle, and Gen Mobile does not allow any unused Services to roll over.

9. **CHARGES AND PAYMENTS.** You are responsible for paying all charges for Services provided under this Agreement (“Service Charges”). The Rate Plan you select determines the Service Charges you must pay, plus any applicable fees, surcharges, and taxes. Not all offers may be available everywhere or combinable with other promotions/options. Service Charges include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) messaging charges; (b) airtime or voice call charges, as applicable; (c) data usage charges, as applicable; (d) international long-distance charges, as applicable; (e) activation charges, as applicable; (f) processing fees, as applicable; and (g) any charges or calls billed to your phone number. You are responsible for all Service Charges to your account, whether or not you were the user of the Device. You must pay all fees, surcharges, and taxes set by federal, state and local governments. To determine fees, surcharges, and taxes, Gen Mobile will use the address you identified as your Primary Service Address (“PSA”). If you did not identify the correct PSA, or if you provided Gen Mobile with an address that is not a recognized street address, does not identify the applicable taxing jurisdictions, or does not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you may be assigned a default PSA. In addition, you agree to pay all regulatory administration fees, surcharges, and taxes, which may include, but are not limited to, Subscriber Line Charges, Regulatory Cost Recovery Fees, various administrative charges, gross receipts charges, processing fees, margin taxes, and charges for the costs Gen Mobile incurs in complying with governmental programs. Regulatory administration charges are not taxes and are not required by law. Gen Mobile sets these charges, and the amounts and what they include are subject to change. They are rates Gen Mobile chooses to collect from you and are kept by Gen Mobile in whole or in part. Gen Mobile determines the rate for these charges, and these amounts are subject to change, as are the components used to calculate these amounts. Changes to fees, surcharges, and taxes will become effective as provided by the taxing or regulatory authority and changes to regulatory administration charges shall be effective immediately.

You may authorize recurring payment for your Services through a credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization (“Auto Pay Authorization”), which authorizes Gen Mobile to charge all amounts you owe Gen Mobile up to five (5) days prior to the payment due date and to demand immediate payment from the card or debit issuer or bank. Unless required by law or as stated in Wallet Auto Pay (see below paragraph), Gen Mobile will not give any additional notice to you or obtain additional consent from you before charging for your Services to that credit or debit card. You must promptly notify Gen Mobile of any change in the credit or debit card or bank transfer authorization you desire to use for payment. If available, you may also make a payment by credit or debit card online via Gen Mobile’s website, via phone through Customer Care, via MyGenMobile App, or via any authorized third party payment processing providers. An additional processing charge may be required, depending on the payment method you choose. If you pay with a check or another negotiable instrument that is returned unpaid by a financial institution for any reason (i.e. insufficient funds), Gen Mobile may charge an additional fee of up to the maximum amount permitted by law for each returned item. Gen Mobile reserves the right, in Gen Mobile’s sole and absolute discretion, to require that you pay for your Services with cash, certified check, cashier’s check, or money order. Gen Mobile also reserves the right to report any check returned to Gen Mobile to reporting and credit agencies and law enforcement.

If you add money into your Gen Mobile account wallet (“Wallet”), you agree that Gen Mobile may apply payments or prepayments (e.g., Auto Pay) in any order to any amount you owe on any account or pursuant to your consent.  You will receive a notice prior to an Auto Pay from your Wallet (“Wallet Auto Pay”).  You may cancel any Wallet Auto Pay by calling Customer Care.  Gen Mobile will refund final credit balances in your Wallet less a $5 administrative fee upon written request or by calling Customer Care, unless otherwise required or prohibited by law.  The administrative fee is a reasonable fee to manually process the refund and to issue and mail you a check of the remaining balance.  If you are no longer a Gen Mobile customer and have less than $5 in your Wallet, Gen Mobile will transfer the remaining balance into an equivalent service of which you will have 30 days to use.  After such period, the balance will be exhausted and services expired.

10. **ACTIVATION FEE.** A one-time activation fee of $39 will be charged to all new or transferred accounts.

11. **7-DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE FOR ONLINE PURCHASES.** Gen Mobile provides a 7-Day Money Back Guarantee for mobile Devices and/or Rate Plan purchases made through the Gen Mobile website at www.genmobile.com.  Purchases made from authorized retailers or distributors do not qualify for this guarantee.  The 7-Day Money Back Guarantee allows you to try mobile Devices purchased from Gen Mobile’s website and Gen Mobile’s Rate Plan for seven (7) calendar days, and, if you are not satisfied with it, you may ask for a full or partial refund in the original form of payment.  A mobile Device purchased with a Rate Plan may be (a) kept with any unused Rate Plan refunded, or (2) returned to Gen Mobile with any unused Rate Plan refunded.  Any returned mobile Device will be subject to Gen Mobile’s Limited Warranty and Return Policy, Return Merchandise Authorization (“RMA”), and any applicable provisions herein.  To request your refund under the 7-Day Money Back Guarantee, please call Customer Care at (833) 528-1380 during regular business hours and within seven (7) calendar days of activating the services of the Rate Plan to open your RMA ticket for your Rate Plan or mobile Device, if applicable.  When calling Customer Care, please make sure you have the following information: order number, phone number, and ESN/IMEI number, if applicable.  Please allow up to thirty (30) to forty-five (45) business days from the date of your RMA ticket to process your refund.  Refunds for the bring your own device (“BYOD”) SIM kit will be processed upon receipt by Gen Mobile.  The completion of your refund may be dependent on the policies of your bank or credit card company.  Gen Mobile may deny your refund if it believes, in its sole discretion, that there is abuse or fraud or any violation of the Agreement, including without limitation, these Terms & Conditions, by you.

12. **SERVICE USAGE LIMITS AND ADD-ONS; FREE BLOCKING OF 900/976 NUMBERS.** Some Rate Plans have a limited number of minutes and/or data. Services expire at the end of the Service Cycle or when any applicable Service limits are reached, whichever comes first.

17. **GEN MOBILE’S RIGHTS ON SERVICE.** Gen Mobile may at any time in its sole and absolute discretion discontinue providing Service to you; change your Rate Plan or the Services provided; reduce the speed of any Service provided, cap, or restrict the amount of use of any Service; discontinue or suspend your account; or discontinue or limit providing connections to particular telephone numbers, features, providers, Services, or types of Services used, requested, or called by you or allow the provision of certain Services or Services in certain areas, at certain times or speeds that, in the sole discretion and judgment of Gen Mobile, appear likely to generate abnormally or unreasonably high call volumes, abnormally or unreasonably long average call lengths, calls with abnormally or unreasonably high costs, abnormally or unreasonably high use, or other disproportionate use in comparison to those of other customers of Gen Mobile, numbers or types of Services which may be disruptive, harmful, or interfere with Gen Mobile’s system or services to other customers.

18. **NETWORK MANAGEMENT BY GEN MOBILE.** Gen Mobile reserves the right to help manage the network in the way that best enables Gen Mobile to maintain Service for Gen Mobile’s customers and minimizes capacity and degradation in the network. Should Gen Mobile’s ability to provide Service to Gen Mobile’s customers be disrupted when you place an abnormally or unreasonably high number of calls, repeatedly place calls which result in abnormally or unreasonably long call lengths, repeatedly place calls with abnormally or unreasonably high costs, high or disproportionate use, or otherwise use Gen Mobile’s Services or the network in excess of the normal or expected amount of use, Gen Mobile reserves the right to block or discontinue Service to certain categories of service, customers, or telephone numbers; to terminate calls or services as described above; to reduce the speed Services are provided; and/or to restrict the amount of an account’s usage.

Gen Mobile can change, eliminate, or reassign any phone number by giving you notice. If your account is deactivated or terminated for any reason, Gen Mobile can reassign the phone number without giving you any notice. You may not assign the phone number to any other Device, equipment, or other party without Gen Mobile’s prior consent. If you assign the phone number without Gen Mobile’s approval, Gen Mobile reserves the right to terminate your Service. You can request a phone number change up to two (2) times at no cost.

21. **ABUSE OF UNLIMITED RATE PLAN.** For any Rate Plan that includes unlimited features, “unlimited” does not mean unreasonable use. Gen Mobile’s unlimited voice features are provided solely for dialogue between two individuals and for non-commercial use. Other uses that disproportionately impacts the network capacities are considered to be unreasonable. Unreasonable voice use includes, but is not limited to, the following: autodialed calls, monitoring services, transmission of broadcasts, telemarketing, call center services, an abnormally high number of conference calling, calls, or messages, and/or calls of abnormally long duration. Gen Mobile’s unlimited data or messaging features are provided solely for purposes of email access, non-commercial messaging, non-continuous streaming of data (e.g., downloading files), and web browsing. While most common uses are permitted by Gen Mobile’s data and messaging features, there are certain uses that cause extreme network capacity issues and are therefore prohibited and in violation with these Terms & Conditions. Gen Mobile’s data and messaging services may not be used: (a) to disrupt email use by others using automated or manual routines, including, but not limited to “auto-responders” or cancel bots or other similar routines; (b) to generate excessive amounts of internet traffic through the continuous, unattended streaming, downloading, or uploading of photos, videos or other files; (c) to maintain continuous active network connections to the internet such as via a web camera or automated machine-to-machine connection or peer-to-peer file sharing; (d) to operate hosting services; (e) to facilitate or transmit any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, “spam,” unsolicited commercial or bulk email or messaging; (f) for activities adversely impacting the ability of other people or systems to use either Gen Mobile’s wireless services or other parties’ internet-based resources, including, but not limited to, “denial of service” attacks against another network hosts or individual users; (g) as a dedicated data connection; (h) for abnormally or unreasonably long data transmissions; or (i) for any other reason that, in Gen Mobile’s sole discretion, violates Gen Mobile’s policy of providing “unlimited” Services for non-commercial use.

22. **COVERAGE LIMITATIONS; NO ROAMING.** Wireless Services are limited to the operating capacity, range, and spectrum of the nationwide network in your service area. Gen Mobile may provide roaming coverage and is subject to change from time to time, without notice, and may not always be available. Roaming means coverage on another carrier’s network.  If roaming is available, your Device will generally let you know.  Roaming coverage can also depend on your Device, your Service, and/or the availability of such coverage.  Not all Services may be available or work the same when roaming.  While roaming, separate charges and/or limits for your Services may apply. Any coverage map made available to you when you activated Service only represents an approximation of Gen Mobile’s anticipated wireless coverage and is subject to change without notice. Gen Mobile does not guarantee availability of the wireless network coverage, and Services may be subject to Device and compatibility limitations. Many factors beyond Gen Mobile’s control (such as network problems, network or internet congestion, software, signal strength, the Mobile Device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites accessed, etc.) affect your ability to make and receive calls on your wireless Device, the quality of those calls, and the speed of your Service. As a result, sometimes Service, including calls or attempted calls to emergency services like 911, may be interrupted, may fail or result in dropped or blocked connections, become unavailable, service speeds are slow, or call quality at times may be poor. When you are outside of Gen Mobile’s coverage area, access will be limited to data and applications previously downloaded to your Device, and not all Services may work. You agree that Gen Mobile is not liable for Service interruptions or problems caused by those factors beyond Gen Mobile’s control. Gen Mobile’s Services and Rate Plans are designed for your use within Gen Mobile’s coverage area and on the networks.

23. **LOCATION-BASED SERVICES OR GPS.** Gen Mobile may collect location information about your Device in relation to the underlying network’s cell towers and the GPS and use that information to provide you with Services and to maintain and improve the wireless network. Your Device may have the capability of using optional content offered by Gen Mobile or third parties that uses your Device’s location. You are subject to the Terms & Conditions and other policies for those location-based services and should review those policies to learn how your location information will be used. If you choose to use location-based services, you agree that Gen Mobile may use the location information transmitted from your wireless Device to improve Gen Mobile’s location services, and you authorize Gen Mobile to send targeted, location-based information to your mobile Device, and to use or provide third parties with your location information in anonymized, aggregate form. Your wireless Device may require you to affirmatively choose to use location-based services, or you may choose to use location-based services.

Certain services that rely on location information, such as E911 and GPS navigation, depend on your wireless Device’s ability to acquire satellite signals and the network coverage. Unlike traditional wireline telephones, 911 operators may not know your wireless Device’s number or location. Due to certain technical constraints, Gen Mobile makes no guarantee that emergency 911 calls will be routed to a specific Public Safety Answering Point or any particular public safety organization, nor is Gen Mobile responsible for the acts or omissions of those parties. E911 service, where enabled by local emergency authorities, uses GPS technology to provide location information. However, E911 does not always provide accurate location information.

24. **MOBILE CONTENT AND THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS.** Certain content and applications available through your wireless Device are provided by third parties. Before you use or download any content or applications provided by a third party, you should review its terms & conditions and any other applicable policies. Any personal information you submit via third party content and/or applications may be collected or used by the third party provider. Gen Mobile is not responsible for third party content and/or applications, including delay, download, failure, installation, interruption, transmission or use, or any content or website you may be able to access through the content and/or applications. When you download, install, or use any content and/or applications sold by a third party, you may be subject to license terms between you and the third party. When you use, install, display, run, or listen to content and/or applications purchased from Gen Mobile, the content and applications are licensed to you by Gen Mobile and may be subject to additional license terms between you and the creator/owner of the content and/or application. You understand and agree that the content and applications are protected by law and are solely for your personal, non-commercial use. You understand and agree that all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the applicable content owner.

25. **DEVICES.** Any Device or equipment that you use in connection with Gen Mobile’s Services must, in Gen Mobile’s sole discretion, be compatible with, and not interfere with, Gen Mobile’s Services and the network, and must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Gen Mobile may periodically program your Device remotely or over-the-air (“OTA”) for features that cannot be changed manually. Gen Mobile assumes no responsibility for the condition or repair of any Device or equipment that you provide. You agree you will not use Gen Mobile phones with any non-Gen Mobile Services or on any other network and not in violation with these Terms & Conditions and/or any laws or regulations.

26. **DEVICE COMPATIBILITY.** Gen Mobile’s Services will work with wireless Devices compatible with the network. Not all Services are available with all wireless Devices or on all networks. Please be aware that Gen Mobile may change your wireless Device’s applications, programming or software remotely or OTA, without notice. This may impact your stored data, or how you have programmed or use your Device. Your Device may not work with another wireless network, and other wireless carriers may not permit your Device on their networks. Some features are only available on Gen Mobile Devices. Gen Mobile is not responsible for any information, including personal and/or sensitive information, on your Device. If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any personal and/or sensitive information when your Device is out of your control or possession. If you submit your Device to Gen Mobile, you agree that its employees, contractors or vendors may access the information on your Device.

27. **LOST/STOLEN DEVICES.** You are responsible for all risk of loss, damage, destruction, or theft of your Device. Call Customer Care immediately if your Device is lost or stolen because you are responsible for usage charges before you notify Gen Mobile of the alleged loss. Once you notify Customer Care, Gen Mobile will suspend your Service. Gen Mobile will not credit or refund any account balance if you choose to terminate Services as a result of loss or theft of your Device. You agree to cooperate with Gen Mobile in investigating suspected fraudulent or unlawful use.

28. **EQUIPMENT LIMITED WARRANTY AND RETURN POLICY.** Gen Mobile offers a limited warranty against out-of-box defects for all Gen Mobile equipment such as mobile Device. Gen Mobile does not cover any water and/or physical damage caused by you or any normal wear-and-tear, cosmetic, or aging damage to the equipment while in your possession. If you purchased your Gen Mobile equipment directly from www.genmobile.com, you have thirty (30) days from the delivery date of your Gen Mobile equipment to return it to Gen Mobile for an exchange or repair. If you purchased your Gen Mobile equipment from an authorized retailer or distributor, you have fifteen (15) days from the delivery date of your equipment to return it to Gen Mobile for an exchange or repair. Gen Mobile reserves the right to exchange or replace the returned Gen Mobile equipment with the same or similar model of equal value based on availability. Please follow the RMA process stated herein these policies. Any unused Rate Plan will be credited upon shipment of the replacement or repaired equipment. Refunds are not allowed for Gen Mobile equipment purchased from an authorized retailer or distributor. Please check with the authorized retailer or dealer to see its refund policies. Non-Gen Mobile equipment are not eligible for any repairs, exchanges, or refunds from Gen Mobile, and you should review any applicable return policies from the retailer where you purchased your non-Gen Mobile equipment.

29. **RETURN MERCHANDISE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS.** You must call Customer Care at (833) 528-1380 to open a RMA ticket to return your Gen Mobile equipment. Within seven (7) days of opening the RMA ticket, you must return the Gen Mobile equipment in the original packaging and include the charger, battery, Device, headset (if applicable), UICC card (if applicable), and a copy of the purchase receipt. All passwords, personal identification numbers, and account information must be removed from the equipment before returning back to Gen Mobile. Any equipment that is locked will be denied and returned to you at your expense.

Box 1187, Gardena, CA 90249. Gen Mobile is not responsible for any lost or mishandled packages. If the equipment is covered under the limited warranty, Gen Mobile reserves the right to exchange the equipment with a similar model of equal value, if the same model is not available. Gen Mobile will provide a thirty (30) day warranty on the exchanged or repaired equipment. Any unused Services will be credited upon shipment of the replacement or repaired equipment.

30. **DISCLAIMER OF FURTHER EQUIPMENT WARRANTY.** WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EQUIPMENT LIMITED WARRANTY AND RETURN POLICY STATE ABOVE, STATEMENTS BY GEN MOBILE OR ITS EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS REGARDING THE DEVICES OR RELATED ACCESSORY EQUIPMENT SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS A FURTHER WARRANTY BY GEN MOBILE OR THE MANUFACTURER. GEN MOBILE MAKES NO FURTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT YOUR DEVICES OR ANY RELATED ACCESSORY EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THIS DISCLAIMER DOES NOT DEPRIVE YOU OF ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU AGAINST THE MANUFACTURER. WITHOUT LIMITATION, GEN MOBILE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH: (a) THE WARRANTY PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER, (b) ANY ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF THE MANUFACTURER, OR (c) ANY MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE OF THE DEVICE OR RELATED ACCESSORY EQUIPMENT.

31. **HEARING AID COMPATIBILITY**. All Gen Mobile Devices offered to customers comply with the Federal Communications Commission’s regulations concerning hearing aid compatibility. Trying out the Gen Mobile Device with your hearing aid Device is the best way to evaluate it for your personal needs and use. If you have questions concerning the capabilities of your Gen Mobile Device, please contact Customer Care.

32. **AMENDMENTS TO AGREEMENT.** Gen Mobile may change this Agreement at any time, including the Rate Plan that you selected upon initiation of Service. The Rate Plan, as modified by Gen Mobile from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, will remain in effect for the Term of your Service, until or unless Gen Mobile changes your Rate Plan or you choose to subscribe to a different Rate Plan, if available. If you wish to change your Rate Plan, you may contact Customer Care. Rate Plan changes may not be effective immediately, and you may be required to pay to make such changes. Gen Mobile may change the price and structure of your Rate Plan, and/or modify the costs, services, or requirements of Gen Mobile’s Rate Plans at any time without prior notice to you. Gen Mobile may change the locations where such Services may be used or where calls can be placed, or rates and terms applicable to such locations, with prior notice to you. Third parties may impose charges upon Gen Mobile for providing Services to you, and you agree to pay any such charges that Gen Mobile passes through to you. If you are an existing customer, you will receive at least fifteen (15) days’ advance notice of any proposed changes that may result in more restrictive terms or conditions, unless a longer period is required by law. After that time period, any such changes will be effective.

YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THESE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THE CHANGES, YOU MUST NOTIFY GEN MOBILE IN WRITING WITHIN FIFTEEN (15) DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY GEN MOBILE THAT YOU WISH TO TERMINATE SERVICE WITHIN THAT TIME OR IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER THE CHANGES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE CHANGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMINATION, AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.

33. **DISPUTE RESOLUTION, MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.**

**A. Mandatory and Binding Arbitration**. In the event that You or we have a Dispute (as defined below) that cannot be resolved through informal dispute resolution pursuant to Section 33(C), then You and we agree (unless You opt out of Section 33 in accordance with Section 33(H)) to resolve such Dispute in an individual action, either through binding arbitration or in small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. You acknowledge and agree that, in the event that You or Gen Mobile commences an individual action in small claims court in accordance with Section 33 and it is determined that the applicable small claims court cannot adjudicate such individual action (e.g., such small claims court lacks jurisdiction over such individual action), then such Dispute may only be resolved through an arbitration proceeding pursuant to Section 33. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration means that You will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator rather than before a judge or jury in a court. Arbitrators can award the same damages that a court can award. Proceeding in arbitration may result in limited discovery and is subject to limited review by courts. Arbitration means that You waive Your right to a trial by a jury or a trial by a judge (other than in small claims court). Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class or representative claims are not permitted. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND GEN MOBILE ARE EACH AGREEING TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR A TRIAL BY A JUDGE (OTHER THAN IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT) AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR TO BRING A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. You and Gen Mobile also each agree that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and, thus, that the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. Nothing in this Agreement precludes You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies (including, without limitation, the Federal Communications Commission). Such agencies can, in the event that the law allows, seek relief against us on Your behalf.

**B. Dispute Defined**. The term “Dispute” means, subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 33(K), any and all past, present or future disputes, claims or controversies between You and Gen Mobile, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, without limitation, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence or any other intentional tort) or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes, without limitation, the validity, enforceability and/or scope of Section 33. The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and includes, without limitation, any and all claims between You and Gen Mobile in any way arising out of, relating to or in connection with: (i) this Agreement and Your applicable Promotion Agreement(s); (ii) Gen Mobile’s services (including, without limitation, Services); (iii) Gen Mobile’s devices or products (including, without limitation, Equipment); (iv) billing, collection and credit reporting; (v) telephone calls, texts, faxes and emails that You claim You received from Gen Mobile and/or a party acting or purporting to act on Gen Mobile’s behalf; and/or (vi) Gen Mobile’s and/or its agents’ collection, retention and/or disclosure of personally-identifiable information. For purposes of Section 33 only, “Gen Mobile,” “we,” “us,” or “our” means DISH Network L.L.C., DISH Wireless, L.L.C., DISH Network Corporation and its past and present direct and indirect subsidiaries, and the predecessors, successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons and entities, and the past or present officers, directors, employees, partners, agents, attorneys, shareholders and legal representatives of all of the foregoing persons and entities.

**C. Informal Dispute Resolution; Notice and Opportunity to Cure**. You and Gen Mobile agree to first try to resolve any Dispute informally. Accordingly, neither You nor Gen Mobile may start an individual action, either through binding arbitration or in small claims court, for at least sixty (60) calendar days after You or Gen Mobile notifies the other of a Dispute by sending a written document titled “dispute resolution notice” (each, a “Dispute Resolution Notice”). You may, but are not required to, download a form Dispute Resolution Notice at http://www.dish.com/downloads/legal/dispute-resolution-notice.pdf. You must send Your Dispute Resolution Notice to the Legal Dispute Resolution Notice Address (i.e., DISH Wireless L.L.C., Attn: Dispute Resolution, P.O. Box 9040, Littleton, Colorado 80120-9040), and we must send our Dispute Resolution Notice to Your billing address then appearing in our records. The Dispute Resolution Notice must: (i) state Your name, account number and contact information; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought in connection with the Dispute. In the event that You and Gen Mobile do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) calendar days after the Dispute Resolution Notice is received, then You or Gen Mobile may commence an individual action, either through binding arbitration or in small claims court, in accordance with Section 33.

**D. Arbitration Procedures**. Unless You and Gen Mobile agree otherwise in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) excluding any rules for class or collective actions, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA and conducted before a single, neutral arbitrator. The AAA Rules are available online at the AAA’s website (as of August 7, 2015, www.adr.org), by calling the AAA, or by submitting a written request to the Legal Dispute Resolution Notice Address (i.e., DISH Wireless L.L.C., Attn: Dispute Resolution, P.O. Box 9040, Littleton, Colorado 80120-9040). The arbitration will be held at a location in the county of Your billing address then appearing in our records unless You and we both agree to another location or a telephonic or “desk” arbitration (i.e., an arbitration conducted solely on the basis of written submissions by the participants). The arbitrator will be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Gen Mobile’s and Your waiver of the right to a trial by jury or a trial by a judge (other than in small claims court) and the right to participate in a class action or to bring a claim in a representative capacity. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to adjudicate the merits of any Dispute. In the event that You and/or Gen Mobile elect to submit a Dispute to arbitration pursuant to Section 33, then the party initiating arbitration must open a case by filing with the AAA: (i) a demand for arbitration; (ii) the administrative filing fee; and (iii) a copy of the applicable arbitration agreement (i.e., Section 33) — (collectively, the “Demand for Arbitration”). The filing may be made through “AAA WebFile,” located on the AAA’s website (www.adr.org), or by filing the Demand for Arbitration with any AAA office, regardless of the intended locale of any hearing.

**E. The Arbitrator’s Award**. An arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement of the disposition of each Dispute and a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator’s decision and award are final and binding, subject only to the limited court review permitted under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**F. Costs of Arbitration**. In the event that You initiate arbitration and agree that You will receive less than $75,000 in damages, then, after Gen Mobile receives notice that You have initiated arbitration, Gen Mobile will promptly reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee and Gen Mobile will directly pay the AAA any case management fees associated with the arbitration and the professional fees for the arbitrator’s services. However, in the event that You initiate an arbitration in which You seek $75,000 or more in damages, then the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

**G. Class Action Waiver**. NEITHER YOU NOR GEN MOBILE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE (as defined above). Further, unless both You and Gen Mobile agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one (1) person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. In the event that any portion of this Section 33(G) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of Section 33 shall be null and void.

**H. Right to Opt Out**. In the event that You do not wish to be bound by Section 33, then You must notify Gen Mobile in writing within thirty (30) days following the date that we first give You notice of Your right to elect to opt out of Section 33 by: (i) completing the Opt Out Form located [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2954/7774/files/arbitration-opt-out.pdf) and sending it to the Legal Dispute Resolution Notice Address (i.e., DISH Wireless L.L.C., Attn: Dispute Resolution, P.O. Box 9040, Littleton, Colorado 80120-9040); or (ii) otherwise providing written notification to Gen Mobile at the Legal Dispute Resolution Notice Address that includes: (1) Your name and account number; (2) Your service address; and (3) a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve Disputes with Gen Mobile through arbitration. Your decision to opt out of Section 33 will have no adverse effect on Your relationship with Gen Mobile or Gen Mobile’s delivery of Service(s) to You. Any opt-out not received within the thirty (30) day period set forth above will not be valid and You must pursue Your Disputes (if any) as an individual action, either through binding arbitration or in small claims court, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 33 (excluding this Section 33 (H), which in such event will no longer apply). In the event that You are a new Gen Mobile customer, then Your activation of a Gen Mobile account or receipt of Services or Equipment and failure to notify Gen Mobile in writing within thirty (30) days following the date of activation of Your account shall constitute Your acknowledgment and agreement that You are bound by Section 33. In the event that You are an existing Gen Mobile customer, then Your continued receipt of Services or Equipment and failure to notify Gen Mobile in writing within thirty (30) days following the date that we first give You notice of Your right to elect to opt out of Section 33 shall constitute Your acknowledgment and agreement that You are bound by Section 33. We will be deemed to have given You notice of Your right to elect to opt out of Section 33 as follows: (a) in the event that we send You notice by U.S. mail (including, without limitation, on a mailed bill, bill insert, notice, letter or postcard), then it will be considered given three (3) days after it is first deposited in the U.S. mail, addressed to You at Your billing address then appearing in our records; and (b) in the event that we send You notice electronically (including, without limitation, via an email and/or SMS), then it will be considered given at the time we first send an electronic communication containing such notice or notifying You of the availability of such notice to the electronic contact information (including, without limitation, email address SMS then appearing in our records.

**I. Miscellaneous**. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that Gen Mobile makes any future change to Section 33 (other than a change to the Legal Dispute Resolution Notice Address), then You may reject any such future change as follows: (i) in the event that we elect to provide notice of such change, then by sending written notice to Gen Mobile at the Legal Dispute Resolution Notice Address of Your rejection of such change within thirty (30) days following the date that we first give You our notice; or (ii) in the event that we elect not to provide notice of such change, then by sending written notice to Gen Mobile at the Legal Dispute Resolution Notice Address of Your rejection of such change at any time. By rejecting any future change, You are agreeing that You will resolve any Dispute between You and Gen Mobile in accordance with the unmodified language of Section 33, unless You have previously opted out of Section 33 in a timely manner. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 33 or under applicable law, each of You and Gen Mobile shall bear and be solely responsible for its respective attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with any Dispute.

**J. Expenses Outside of Arbitration**. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, in the event that either party files a judicial or administrative action asserting a claim that is subject to arbitration (other than an individual action in small claims court) and the other party successfully compels arbitration, then the party filing that judicial or administrative action must pay the other party’s costs and expenses incurred in seeking to compel arbitration (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses and court costs).

**K. Exceptions**. The following Disputes are excluded from Section 33 (including, without limitation, the informal dispute resolution provision set forth in Section 33(C)) and may only be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) any Dispute based on Your receipt of all or any portion of the Services without paying for them, whether through theft of Services, piracy or otherwise; and (ii) any Dispute based on a violation of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq., or the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2521 et seq., or any federal or state law relating to signal theft or theft of service.

**L. Survival**. Section 33 shall survive expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement for any reason or no reason indefinitely.

34. **EXCLUSIVE REMEDY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.** YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR (a) GEN MOBILE’S, OR ITS DEALER’S, AGENT’S, REPRESENTATIVE’S, VENDOR’S, SUPPLIER’S, OR OTHER CARRIER’S FAILURE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SERVICE OR GEN MOBILE’S FAILURE TO PERFORM HEREUNDER SHALL BE YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE GEN MOBILE RE-PERFORM SUCH SERVICE. UNLESS THE LAW FORBIDS IT IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE, OR (b) ANY DEFECT, FAILURE, OR MALFUNCTION OTHERWISE RELATED TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DEVICE OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PRODUCT SUPPLIED OR PROVIDED BY GEN MOBILE, SHALL BE YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE GEN MOBILE REPAIR, REPLACE, AND/OR REFUND SUCH DEVICE, OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR PRODUCT. UNLESS THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SET FORTH IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE IS PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE TO LIMIT CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES OR OTHER MONETARY RELIEF AGAINST GEN MOBILE, OR ANY AGENT, CARRIER, DEALER, MANUFACTURER, REPRESENTATIVE, SUPPLIER, OR VENDOR, TO THE LESSER OF: (i) YOUR DIRECT DAMAGES OR (ii) THE PRORATED MONTHLY OR OTHER CHARGES YOU PAID OR OWE GEN MOBILE FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE OR WIRELESS DEVICE FOR ONE MONTH’S SERVICE CHARGES.

AS A MATERIAL PART OF THE CONSIDERATION PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY GEN MOBILE OR ANY AGENT, CARRIER, DEALER, MANUFACTURER, REPRESENTATIVE, SUPPLIER, OR VENDOR OF GEN MOBILE, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION TO THE CONTRARY, YOU AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS GEN MOBILE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, TREBLE, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR LOST PROFITS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THE SAME MAY BE DISCLAIMED BY LAW. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER PARTY WILL SEEK ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR DAMAGES FROM THE OTHER. THIS EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, LIMITATION, AND WAIVER ALSO APPLIES TO ANY CLAIMS EITHER PARTY MAY BRING AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY THAT PARTY FOR SUCH CLAIM. THIS LIMITATION AND WAIVER WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BREACH OF CONTRACT, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, NEGLIGENCE, PERSONAL INJURY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OTHER TORT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY.

YOU AGREE THAT THE FOREGOING ALLOCATION OF RISK SHALL, IN THE EVENT OF GEN MOBILE'S INABILITY, DESPITE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS, TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR THE PRODUCTS, REMAIN IN EFFECT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES PROVIDED FOR UNDER THIS SECTION THEN SATISFY THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY WERE INTENDED, OR OTHERWISE PROVIDE YOU WITH A FAIR QUANTUM OF RELIEF.

You agree that neither Gen Mobile nor its parent, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors, representatives and affiliates, suppliers or vendors are responsible for any damages resulting from: (a) any action or omission by a third party; (b) communication or information that is blocked by a spam filter; (c) data content or information accessed while using Gen Mobile’s Services; (d) failed, inaccurate, or interrupted location information services; (e) a failure or interruption in accessing or attempting to access emergency services from a wireless Device, including through 911, Enhanced 911 (“E911”), or otherwise; (f) providing or failing to provide Services, including, but not limited to, deficiencies or problems with a wireless Device or network coverage (i.e., blocked, dropped, or interrupted Services); (g) traffic or other accidents, or any health-related claims relating to Gen Mobile’s Services; and (h) damage to your wireless Device or any computer or equipment connected to your wireless Device, or damage to or loss of any information stored on your wireless computer, Device, equipment, or Gen Mobile storage space from your use of the Services or from trojans, viruses, worms, or downloads of malicious content, data, images, materials, text, video or audio. You also agree that Gen Mobile isn’t liable for deleted or missed voice mails or other messages, or for any information, such as texts and pictures, that gets deleted or lost if Gen Mobile services your wireless Device. If another wireless carrier is involved in any problem, you also agree to any limitations of liability in its favor that it imposes. You should implement appropriate safeguards to secure your wireless Device or equipment and to back up your information.

35. **CONSUMER COMPLAINTS.** Pursuant to California Civil Code § 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.

36. **DISCLAIMER OF SERVICE WARRANTIES.** GEN MOBILE MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES FOR SERVICES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE CONCERNING YOUR SERVICES. SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS. GEN MOBILE DOES NOT PROMISE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICES AND DOES NOT AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO MAKE ANY WARRANTIES ON GEN MOBILE’S BEHALF. YOU AGREE TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD GEN MOBILE HARMLESS FOR ALL SUCH SERVICE ISSUES.

37. **FORCE MAJEURE.** You agree that Gen Mobile will not be held responsible for any damage, delay, failure, or loss in performance of any of the Services or of any of these Terms & Conditions, if applicable, caused by accident or casualty; act of God or unnamed events or acts otherwise known as force majeure, acts of any third party; act of terrorism; declared or undeclared war or armed conflict; national, state or local emergencies; civil disobedience; delay in transportation; earthquake; embargo; explosion; failure of suppliers to deliver equipment; acts or omissions of carriers or suppliers; fire; flood; government requirement or other civil or military authority; acts of regulatory or governmental agencies; labor disputes; lightning; meteorological phenomenon; power failure or blackout; severe weather; shortage of labor or materials; strikes or other concerted acts of workers (whether of Gen Mobile or others); volcanic action; or other similar causes beyond Gen Mobile’s control, which prevent or hinder the delivery of any Services (“Conditions”). If any foregoing Conditions occur, you are obligated to pay for any Services provided to you, and Gen Mobile may elect to immediately terminate any Services without notice.

38. **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**. You agree to respect the intellectual property rights of Gen Mobile and third parties, and not to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise injure those rights. Except for a limited personal, non-commercial license to use the Services or Devices, your purchase of Gen Mobile’s Devices and Services does not grant you any license or right to copy, download, modify, reverse engineer, redistribute, or resell the intellectual property of Gen Mobile or others related to the Devices and/or Services, without the express written permission of the rightful owner.

### **GEN MOBILE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM (ACP) TERMS & CONDITIONS**

Version July 2023

Please carefully read these Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) terms and conditions (“ACP Terms & Conditions”) and Gen Mobile’s (a) Terms & Conditions, (b) Consumer Policies & Privacy Notice, (c) MyGenMobile App End User License Agreement; (d) the Auto Pay Authorization, (e) the ILD Consumer Agreement, (f) the Global Unlimited Text Messaging, (g) the Rate Plan, and (h) Gen Mobile’s rules and policies as made available to you from time to time, which may apply to you when purchasing or using our products and/or services regarding your ACP benefit provided by Gen Mobile.  These ACP Terms & Conditions may be amended or updated at any time and from time to time in Gen Mobile’s sole and absolute discretion (effective immediately upon posting).

When we say “we”, “us”, “our” or “Gen Mobile”, we mean DISH Wireless L.L.C. and when we say “you”, “your”, “customer” and “user”, we mean a Gen Mobile account holder or anyone who uses our Devices or Services, including, without limitation, all beneficiaries hereof.

1. **What is the** **Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)****?** The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is a long-term, broadband federal government benefit program by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) available to eligible households and replaces the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program.  You may be eligible for ACP based on your income or other qualifying criteria. The ACP benefit is a $30 discount which can be applied to any of Gen Mobile's phone plans or connected device plans. You can receive free service if you choose Gen Mobile’s $30 ACP phone plan that includes unlimited talk & text and 7GB LTE data or Gen Mobile’s $30 ACP connected device plan that includes 7GB LTE data. You may choose a plan that costs more for which you will have to pay the difference between the higher-cost plan and the $30 discount. Click [](https://www.genmobile.com/pages/plans)to see Gen Mobile’s current Rate Plans.  Gen Mobile’s ACP plans do not include international or domestic roaming and may not include hotspotting subject to the device capabilities.   All plans have a 30-day cycle. Plans require a mobile device (i.e. phone, tablet, or hotspot) compatible with the Gen Mobile network. You may bring your own mobile device. Gen Mobile may offer you a free mobile phone, an upgraded phone, and/or a discounted tablet, subject to availability. ACP does not provide or subsidize phones. To receive a one-time discounted connected device (i.e., tablet) under ACP, you must be from an eligible household and will have to pay a minimum of $10.01 and a maximum of $49.99 for the connected device and that, to the best of your knowledge, no one in your household has received a connected device discount from any service provider through the ACP or the EBB program.  You understand that you do not need to purchase any device from Gen Mobile in order to enroll in the ACP and receive the ACP benefit. This offer is not combinable with other offers. There is only one monthly discount for your ACP-supported service per household and is not transferable to another. Gen Mobile reserves the right to disconnect any service due to 30-days of non-use or other disqualifying terms as provided in the ACP.  Gen Mobile reserves the right to disconnect your ACP-supported service after 90 consecutive days of nonpayment.  You will be subject to Gen Mobile’s undiscounted rates and Terms & Conditions if the ACP ends, if you transfer your ACP benefit to another provider but continue to receive service from us, or upon de-enrollment from the ACP.  Gen Mobile ACP offerings are subject to network availability and device compatibility and are protected against inappropriate upselling.  You agree that any state, local, Tribal government, school, or school district, may share information about your receipt of benefits that would establish eligibility for the ACP, and that such information will be used only to determine your ACP eligibility.  If you are seeking to qualify for ACP benefits as an eligible resident of Tribal lands, you certify that you live on Tribal lands, as defined in FCC rule 47 C.F.R. 54.400(e).

2. **Transfer Limits.** If you are currently receiving your ACP benefit from another service provider, by enrolling in Gen Mobile’s ACP, you are affirmatively consenting to transfer your ACP benefit to Gen Mobile and that the transfer of your ACP benefit will be applied to Gen Mobile’s service and will no longer be applied to service retained from the other service provider, that you may be subject to the other service provider’s undiscounted rates as a result of the transfer if you elect to maintain service from the other service provider, and that you are limited to one ACP-transfer transaction per service month with limited exceptions to reverse an improper transfer or address situations impacting your receipt of the ACP-supported service from a particular provider.

3. **Keeping your ACP benefit.** You understand that after service activation to maintain your ACP benefit, you must within any 30-day period complete an outbound voice call or data use, receive a voice call from other than Gen Mobile, send a text message, purchase minutes or data from Gen Mobile and add to your service plan, or respond to Gen Mobile confirming that you would like to continue receiving your ACP discount. If you do not, Gen Mobile will send me a notice of non-usage, and you will have 15 days to cure when applicable. If you do not cure your non-usage, Gen Mobile reserves the right to disconnect any service due to nonuse or other disqualifying terms as provided in the ACP (911 and Gen Mobile Customer Care calls will be permitted). Use of Wi-Fi to go online does not count as usage.

4. **Third Party Vendor Authorization**. You authorize Gen Mobile and its third party vendor(s) to consult the National Lifeline Accountability Database (NLAD) and the National Lifeline Eligibility Verifier (National Verifier) to determine your eligibility for ACP, if you have previously received a “connected device benefit” from another service provider, and if you have an active ACP benefit with another service provider. You authorize and give express consent for Gen Mobile and its third party vendor(s) to contact you to validate your eligibility for, desire to participate in, or subscription to Gen Mobile’s ACP offers and other products and services via email, telephone, or text messaging, including calls using an automated telephone dialing system, manually, or with pre-recorded/artificial voice messages. Text messaging and data rates may apply. Consent for emails, calls and texts is optional and can be revoked at any time by dialing 611 from your Gen Mobile provided wireless number or by calling 1-833-528-1380 and revoking consent. However, you understand that opting out will not affect Gen Mobile’s ability to contact you with notices and messages regarding ACP and connected device benefits and/or any other service or product via the methods listed herein. For more information see our Terms & Conditions and Consumer Policies & Privacy Notice at [genmobile.com](http://www.genmobile.com/). You acknowledge that you are providing the information you have included in your ACP enrollment application to Gen Mobile and its third party vendor(s) and further authorize them to receive and use your information for enrollment verification and waste, fraud, and abuse mitigation purposes. You also authorize Gen Mobile and its third party vendor(s) to receive and use your historic EBB and ACP enrollment information for verification and waste, fraud, and abuse mitigation purposes. You authorize Gen Mobile and its third party vendor(s), for the purpose of applying for, determining eligibility, enrolling in and seeking reimbursement of ACP and connected device benefits, to collect, use, share, and retain your personal information, including but not limited to, information required for the purpose of establishing eligibility for and enrolling in the ACP, and including, but not limited to, full name, full residential address, date of birth, last four digits of social security number, telephone number, eligibility criteria and status, the date on which the ACP service discount was initiated, and, if applicable, terminated, usage status, and other compliance requirements, the amount of support being sought for the service, and information necessary to establish identity and verifiable address. This information may be shared with Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) to ensure proper administration of the ACP.  Failure to provide consent will result in me being denied ACP and/or connected device benefits.

5. **Consumer Complaint.** You understand that you may file a complaint regarding your ACP benefit via the FCC’s [](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/4412582232980-Need-Help-with-an-Affordable-Connectivity-Program-ACP-or-Emergency-Broadband-Benefit-EBB-complaint). You will notify Gen Mobile by calling 1-855-GEN4ACP (1-855-436-4227) if you no longer qualify for the ACP benefit or any of the federal assistance programs identified in your application form or when your annual household income is above 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (the amount listed in the Federal Poverty Guidelines table listed in the National Verifier Application) or any change of address (within thirty (30) days). You know that knowingly or willingly giving false or fraudulent information to receive the ACP benefit is punishable by law and can result in prosecution, fines, jail time, de-enrollment, and/or being barred from the program.

6. **Enrolling Gen Mobile’s ACP**. By enrolling in Gen Mobile’s ACP, you certify, under penalty of perjury, that the information included in the application and certifications is true and correct to the best of your knowledge. You understand that you may withdraw your consent prior to the activation of your service and may obtain a paper copy of your contractual terms and associated fees or withdraw this consent by calling this form by contacting 1-855-GEN4ACP (855-436-4227).

When we say “We”, “Us”, “Our” or “Gen Mobile”, we mean DISH Wireless L.L.C. and when we say “You”, “Your”, and “User”, we mean a Gen Mobile-branded account holder or someone who uses our devices or services.

1. **Lifeline Program**. The Lifeline Program (“Lifeline”) is a government assistance program that provides discounted telephone services to eligible households funded by the Federal Universal Service Fund.  A household means adults and children who are living together at the same address as one economic unit. An economic unit includes all adults (persons at least 18 years old unless emancipated) contributing to and sharing the household’s income and expenses.  Only one discount per eligible household is permitted and is nontransferable to another person.  The discount is tied to a single, primary residential address.  You may transfer Your Lifeline discount from one carrier to another, but You cannot have this discount from multiple carriers.  Any household that violates the one discount per household rule or knowingly or willingly provides false information to obtain the Lifeline discount will lose its discount or will be banned from Lifeline and may be prosecuted by the government. 

2. **Applying for Lifeline**. You must complete an application form, provide supporting documents that demonstrate their household meets the eligibility requirements, and certify under penalty of perjury that they comply with the Lifeline rules.  The National Verifier administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”) will determine whether You meet the eligibility requirements to participate in Lifeline.  If You are seeking to qualify for Lifeline as an eligible resident of Tribal lands, You must live on federally recognized Tribal lands.

3. **Eligibility**. There are two ways to qualify for the Lifeline discount: Program-Based or Income-Based.  Program-Based qualification requires You or someone in Your household to be enrolled in a public assistance program such as Medicaid, SNAP, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or other qualifying government programs.  Income-Based qualification requires Your household’s total annual gross income is at or less 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines.  You must show proof of participation in the program(s) or income.

4. **Lifeline Discounts**. All Lifeline plans will have at least 1,000 voice minutes and text messages and 4.5 GB of data.  No termination fee will be assessed if you discontinue Your Lifeline services.  If You believe You no longer qualify for Lifeline or are receiving more than one discount, please contact Gen Mobile Customer Care or Your state’s public utilities commission (the “Commission) within thirty (30) days of such event.  You will be subject to penalties if You fail to notify us or the Commission.

5. **Lifeline Services**. We offer Lifeline plans on a prepaid basis with a thirty (30) day cycle, on a non-discriminatory basis and only to households that are approved for Lifeline.  Gen Mobile’s Lifeline is only available for activation by customers who reside in an area where We have been designated as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (“ETC”).  We may, in Our sole discretion, add features and/or enhancements to Our Lifeline offerings in addition to the minimum service standards.  Unlimited talk and text does not mean unreasonable or commercial.  See below Our Lifeline wireless service plans.

6. **Activation Fees**. Gen Mobile may charge an activation fee.

7. **Annual Re-certification**. In order to keep Your Lifeline discount, You must re-certify that You are qualified to continue Your participation in the Lifeline.  You must recertify timely in response to a request for re-certification from USAC, otherwise You will lose Your discount and may be subject to regular retail rates. 

8. **De-Enrollment**. You or Your household may lose Your Lifeline discount for any of the following reasons: You or Your household no longer qualifies; You or Your household are receiving more than one discount; You do not use your Lifeline discounted services for thirty (30) consecutive days (Gen Mobile will notify You and You will have 15 days to use Your service to continue receiving the discount); You violate any of the Lifeline rules; or You do not timely re-certify.  You may request to de-enroll from our Lifeline.  Use of Your Lifeline means completing an outbound call or using data; purchasing additional minutes or data to Your plan; answering an incoming call from anyone other than Gen Mobile; answering a direct contact from Us and confirming You want to continue receiving the service; or sending a text message.
