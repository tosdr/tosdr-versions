You may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing” or processing of your information for targeted advertising as described below.

We also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name and email address. If we are unable to verify you, we may be unable to respond to your requests. To exercise any of these rights, you can [use the form located here](#) or email us at [\[email protected\]](https://cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with your name and type of request you are making.

### Notice to California residents

If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding how we collect, use, and disclose your “personal information” as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).

We describe the categories of information we collect, our business purposes for collecting such information, the sources and uses of such information and the entities with which we disclose such information in the “Information we collect about you”, “Our use of your information,” and “How we disclose your information” sections of this Privacy Policy. We provide additional information required by the CCPA below.

**A. Categories of Personal Information we collect, use and disclose**

Throughout this Privacy Policy, we discuss in detail the types of information we collect from and about users and discuss how we use and disclose such information. The following are the “categories” of personal information under the CCPA that we collect from California consumers and that we may, as discussed throughout this Privacy Policy, use and disclose for our business purposes:

* Identifiers (such as name, address, email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); financial data (such as credit card information processed by our payment processor); device identifiers (such as IP address and unique device identifiers); internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history); general geolocation data derived from IP addresses; any user-generated content or feedback that you provide; and username and password (which is considered “sensitive” personal information under California law).
    

**B. How we use these categories of personal information**

We and our service providers may use the categories of personal information we collect from and about you for the following business and commercial purposes (as those terms are defined in applicable law).

* Our or our service providers’ operational purposes;
    
* Auditing consumer interactions on our site (e.g., measuring ad impressions);
    
* Detecting, protecting against, and prosecuting security incidents and fraudulent or illegal activity;
    
* Bug detection and error reporting;
    
* Customizing content that we or our service providers display on the Services (e.g., contextual ads);
    
* Providing the Services (e.g., account servicing and maintenance, customer service, advertising and marketing, analytics, and communication about the Services);
    
* Improving our existing Services and developing new services (e.g., by conducting research to develop new products or features);
    
* Other uses that advance our commercial or economic interests, such as third-party advertising and communicating with you about relevant offers from third party partners;
    
* Other uses about which we notify you.
    

We may also use the categories of personal information for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and we may combine the information we collect (“aggregate”) or remove pieces of information (“de-identify”) to limit or prevent identification of any user or device. We may also disclose this information to third parties for legal, compliance or security purposes, or in connection with a business transfer, as described further in “How we disclose your personal information” above.

**C. Sale/Sharing of Personal Information**

The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information or “share” personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. Under the CCPA, “sale” and “sharing” are defined such that they may include allowing third parties to receive certain information for advertising purposes. We “sell” or “share” the following categories of information to third-party advertising partners and vendors that support our advertising efforts (such as advertising analytics services):

* Identifiers (such as name, address, email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history and usage information).
    

If you would like to opt out of our use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” or “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes under California law, please click the following link, which is also available in the footer of our Site: "Cookie Preferences" and use the "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" toggle at the bottom of the tool.

We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

**D. Additional Privacy Rights**

In addition to the rights section before in section C above, California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in “Your data rights and choices” section above.

Moreover, if we ever offer any financial incentives in exchange for your personal information, we will provide you with appropriate information about such incentives.

In the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.

**E. Shine the Light**

California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
