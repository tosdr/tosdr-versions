### 13\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

**PLEASE READ THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN COURT.**

### 13.1 Initial Dispute Resolution

If a dispute arises between you and Cypress, we are committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. For any such dispute, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally for at least sixty (60) days before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. This requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if any, to the following email address: [\[email protected\]](https://cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). For any dispute that Cypress initiates, we will send our written description of the dispute to the email address we have on file for you. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; and the specific relief sought. To the fullest extent allowable by law, this informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.

### 13.2 Arbitration Agreement

### 13.2.1 Mutual Arbitration

To the fullest extent allowable by law, you and Cypress agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of the use of the Site, which includes these Terms (including its formation, performance, and breach), or that in any way relate to the provision of the Site, your relationship with Cypress, or any other dispute with Cypress, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 13.2 (collectively, the "Arbitration Agreement"). This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth in Section 13.2.9 and 13.2.10. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and Cypress expressly agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.

Except as set forth in this Section 13.2.1, the arbitrator or arbitration body, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Agreement (including these Terms) and this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part thereof are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.

Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initial chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights); and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party's claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party's right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.

You and Cypress agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Atlanta, Georgia in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, further agree to accept service of process by U.S. mail and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.

Except as set forth in Section 13.2.2 below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions thereof remain in full force and effect.

THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM, AND THAT RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. **YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND CYPRESS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.**

### 13.2.2 Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver

YOU AND CYPRESS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT OTHERWISE IN THIS SECTION 13.2.2 AND SECTION 13.2.6 BELOW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER CONSOLIDATED ACTION AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM, UNLESS CYPRESS PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.

If there is a final judicial determination that either the Class Arbitration Action and Collective Relief Waiver or the provisions in Section 13.2.6 are not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. This provision does not prevent you or Cypress from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

### 13.2.3 Arbitration Rules

The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) and resolved before a single arbitrator. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider, but in no event shall any arbitration be administered by the American Arbitration Association. Except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" provision, NAM will administer the arbitration in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at [\[email protected\]](https://cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### 13.2.4 Initiating Arbitration

Only after the parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure provision, and only if those efforts fail, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims using the procedures set forth in the applicable NAM rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to [\[email protected\]](https://cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If Cypress is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address that Cypress has on file for you. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party's failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure contemplated by this Agreement.

### 13.2.5 Arbitration Location and Procedure

If you are a resident of the United States the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside, and if you are not a resident of the United States the arbitration shall be conducted in Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America, unless you and Cypress otherwise agree or unless the designated arbitrator determines that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Cypress submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.

Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Cypress (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).

### 13.2.6 Batch Arbitration

To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with Section 13.2.3 if NAM is unavailable) against Cypress within reasonably close proximity ("Mass Filing"), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with Section 13.2.3 if NAM is unavailable) in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Cypress and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Cypress and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This "Batch Arbitration" provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Cypress otherwise consents in writing, Cypress does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in Section 13.2.2 above and this section 13.2.6. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.

### 13.2.7 Arbitrator's Decision

The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with Section 13.2.2 above and also must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of liability" section of these Terms as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys' fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.

### 13.2.8 Fees

You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Section 13.2.6), provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 13 while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.

### 13.2.9 Right to Opt-Out of the Arbitration Agreement.

IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” AS SET FORTH IN THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION 13, THEN: (1) you must notify Cypress in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you began to use the Site or otherwise become subject to this Arbitration Agreement (or any subsequent changes to the provisions of the section titled “Dispute Resolution”); (2) your written notification must be mailed to 6595 Roswell Road, Suite G2734, Atlanta, GA 30328 or emailed to [\[email protected\]](https://cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection); and (3) your written notification must include (a) your name, (b) your address, and (c) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Cypress will continue to honor any valid opt outs if you opted out of arbitration in a prior version of the Agreement pursuant to the requirements set forth in that version. If you do not timely opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, such action shall constitute mutual acceptance of the terms of these “Dispute Resolution” provisions by you and Cypress.

### 13.2.10 Changes

Cypress will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section by posting the change on the Site or providing any other notice in accordance with legal requirements. Any such changes will go into effect 30 days after Cypress provides this notice and apply to all claims not yet filed. If you reject any such changes by opting out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If Cypress changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Site 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may opt out by providing notice as described in Section 13.2.9. References to “Cypress,” “you,” and “us” in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates; those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of the Site as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Site under this or prior Terms between us.

### 14\. Governing law and venue

To the fullest extent permitted by law, these Terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act with respect to Section 13 (Dispute Resolution) and the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by law and except as otherwise expressly set out in Section 13 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes that you and Cypress are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Atlanta, Georgia, and you and Cypress each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

### 15\. Changes to these Terms

We may update the Terms from time to time. If we make a material change to the Terms, we will notify you as required by law. Please regularly check the Site for information about revisions to the Terms. By continuing to use the Site or provide us information through your use of the Site after we make a change to the Terms, you accept the updated provisions in the Terms.

### 16\. Miscellaneous

Force Majeure. The failure of Cypress to comply with these Terms because of an act of God, war, fire, riot, terrorism, earthquake, actions of federal, state or local governmental authorities or for any other reason beyond the reasonable control of Cypress, shall not be deemed a breach of these Terms.

Non-waiver. If Cypress fails to act with respect to your breach or anyone else’s breach on any occasion, Cypress is not waiving its right to act with respect to future or similar breaches.

Remedies. All remedies under these Terms shall be cumulative and not exclusive.

Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Assignment. You may not assign your rights under these Terms to any third party. We may assign our rights under this Terms without condition.

Entire agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Cypress regarding the Site and Content and your use of the Site and Content. Although the Site may allow you to receive data regarding products or services received or to be received under other agreements with Cypress or third parties (“Other Agreements”), or to communicate with Cypress about the subject of such Other Agreements, the scope and content of those Other Agreements are not amended by these Terms; the scope or content of these Terms is not amended by the Other Agreements; these Terms do not apply to matters within the scope of the Other Agreements; and vice versa. The Site and your use of the Site are governed by these Terms. Termination of these Terms does not terminate the Other Agreements.
