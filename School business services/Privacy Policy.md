We follow laws and guidelines when sending marketing communications including: -

      When using third party companies to assist with marketing we ensure data collection and use is done in accordance with data protection laws  
      We never provide your details to third party companies outside of SEG.

Such marketing activities may include sending promotional and commercial communications regarding services offered by School Business Services and/or SEG. This may include co-marketing or joint sale opportunities, including promotional events, training and webinars.  
  
In some cases, personal data that you provide us is done via group company platforms. This data may be shared and combined with personal data collected throughout your relationship with School Business Services. Where this is done, it will be communicated to you and, where necessary, obtain your consent before doing so.

Please note that we will use customer data for those who have created an application, opted into marketing messages or requested additional information to evaluate its practices and as a method to improve its services. We use Google systems to help us achieve this and further details on how this is used please see [here](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/7475709?hl=en-GB).
