This Privacy Policy describes A24 Films LLC (“**A24**,” “**we**,” “**our**,” or “**us**”) collects, uses, and shares information about you, and applies to your use of any website, mobile application, or online service location that posts a link to this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to our websites at [a24films.com](http://a24films.com/), [a24auctions.com](http://a24auctions.com/), [publicaccess.a24films.com](http://publicaccess.a24films.com/), and [screeningroom.a24films.com](http://screeningroom.a24films.com/) (each, a “**Site**”), and all applications, features, content, and other services that we own, control and make available to you (collectively, with the Sites, the “**Services**”). If you are an employee or contractor, your personal information collected in those contexts will be subject to a separate privacy notice that we provide to you where and when appropriate.  

For purposes of applicable data protection laws, A24 Films LLC is the data controller with regard to the data processing described below. You can contact our data protection officer (“**DPO**”) at [DPO@a24films.com](mailto: dpo@a24films.com).

We and our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) collect the following categories of personal information, depending on your interactions with us:

* Identifiers and contact information, such as your name, address, phone number, IP address, email address, and A24 account username and password;

* Internet or other electronic network activity information when you visit the Sites or interact with our emails or online ads and content. For example, we use tracking tools like cookies and pixels to automatically collect information like device identifiers, the type of browser and operating system you are using, your browsing and search history on the Sites, what areas of the Sites you visit and for how long, what products or content you view and click on, what website you came from to get to us and what website you go to when you leave us, and your interactions with our digital ads and content on other websites. We also embed web beacons (also known as pixels) in the emails we send to you to help us understand how you interact with those messages, such as whether and when you opened an email or clicked on any content within the email;
* Location: We collect your general location via pixels when you interact with our Site.
* Professional or employment-related information if you apply for a job, such as your resume/CV, work history, social/professional networking pages, and any other info you choose to submit with your job application.

We also use social widgets (which are buttons or icons provided by third-party social media[https://a24films.com/admin/ent...](https://a24films.com/admin/entries/pages/2993-privacy-policy#) providers) that allow you to interact with social media services when you view a webpage or mobile app screen.

* Fulfill any other purpose disclosed at the time you provide personal information.

We will not use information we’ve collected from you for purposes that are materially different, unrelated, or incompatible with this Privacy Policy without providing you with prior notice. Information that has been deidentified or aggregated is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and we and our Service Providers may use it without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law.

4\. We Collect Information About You From Various Sources.

We collect and receive information about you from various sources, both indirectly and directly:

* Information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you register an account, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, access our content, or otherwise communicate or transact with us through the Sites and Services, or engage with us on behalf of your employer.
* Information collected automatically from your devices. We and our Service Providers use tracking tools like browser cookies, beacons, and pixels to automatically collect information about you when you interact with our Sites and Services, including when you view or click on our digital ads and emails that we send to you.
* Information collected on our behalf by Service Providers. We hire Service Providers to help us operate our business. Service Providers may host or maintain our Sites, provide cloud services, send emails, assist with customer support, provide market research or analytics, assist in order fulfillment, collect or publish customer reviews, or process payments. In performing such activities on our behalf, those Service Providers collect information about you.
* Information provided by other users. We may receive information about you from other users and individuals, for instance if someone gifts you a AAA24 membership or if someone gifts you a pass to our Screening Room service.
* Information provided by other parties. We work with other business partners, marketing partners, foundations, data brokers, social media platforms, exhibitors (such as movie theaters and streaming platforms), and other Third Party Services (as defined below) that may give us information about you. If you are a job applicant, we may get information about you from background check providers and job references (such as past employers). When we get information from other sources, we may combine that in a database with information we already have.

5\. We Share and Disclose Your Information.

We share your personal information, including in some cases your sensitive personal information. Depending on the circumstances, we can share your personal information with the following parties:

* With our Service Providers who host or maintain our Sites, provide cloud services, send emails, assist with customer support, provide market research or analytics, assist in order fulfillment, collect or publish customer reviews, or process payments. We share information with those Service Providers in order for them to perform the activities listed above in Section 3 at our instruction or on our behalf (in which case they will handle personal information in the capacity of data processors or service providers under applicable data protection law); Please note that these Service Providers will directly collect, or receive from A24, sensitive personal information as necessary for them to process payments, verify your username and password when logging into an A24 account, or conduct background checks on job applicants;
* With our affiliates. We may share information with other brands within the A24 ownership structure, such as Rules Beauty LLC d/b/a Half Magic Beauty.
* With our business partners. For instance, we may share information with organizations with whom we jointly sell or co-brand merchandise, with whom we run a joint promotion, with whom we collaborate on ticketed events (such as virtual screening rooms or in-person screenings), distributors of our content (such as movie theaters and streaming platforms), or organizations who are the beneficiary of auction proceeds.
* With marketing companies and social media platforms. We share information with companies that help us in our marketing efforts, including social media platforms, ad servers, advertising networks, and adtech platforms. This includes allowing select marketing companies to place their own cookies or other tracking tools on our Sites to track your activities across time and services, so that they may tailor and serve ads to you based on your activities (“Interest-based Advertising”). The information collected and stored by these marketing companies remains subject to their own policies and practices. For further information on tracking technologies and your choices regarding them, please see “[Your Choices](#yourchoices)” below;
* With third parties in relation to the sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions that we run from time to time, either by ourselves or jointly with another organization. If you voluntarily choose to enter such a promotion, we will disclose your personal information to third parties for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., by publishing your information as part of a legally required winners list, if you win), and we may share your information with a co-sponsor;
* With law enforcement, government bodies, and other officials as required to comply with the law or other legal process, and where required, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
* With other parties as reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of us, the Sites, the Services or any third party, including to enforce our policies;
* With other companies (including their and our advisors) in connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company;
* With other third parties we describe to you at the time you provide your personal information, for the limited purposes we disclose at such time; and
* With other third parties at your express consent or at your direction.

Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may share aggregated information which does not identify you, or deidentified information about you, with third parties for any purpose.

Additionally, certain areas of the Sites and Services are designed to help you share information with the public and other users, such as public comment sections or other interactive features. If you choose to make information public through the Sites or Services, other users will have access to it. We cannot guarantee that the information you make public through the Sites or Services will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please think carefully before making information public. You are solely responsible for information you make public.

6\. Third Party Services, Features, and Devices.

Our Sites and Services contain content from and hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, and services operated and owned by third parties (“**Third Party Services**”), such as social network sites. In addition, the Sites and Services contain features that allow you to interact with, connect to, or access the Sites and Services through Third Party Services and third party devices (“**Third Party Features**”). For example, you interact with a Third Party Service when you “like” or “share” content over social media through our Services, or when you purchase merchandise from our Site. Remember that third parties may use their own tracking tools to independently collect information about you, and may solicit personal information from you. Also, if you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature.  

7\. Your Choices.

**A. Marketing Communications.**

You can opt out of receiving promotional e-mails from us at any time by following the instructions in the e-mails to click on the unsubscribe link, or by sending an e-mail to us at [DPO@a24films.com](mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com), with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject field of the e-mail. Please note that your opt out is limited to the e-mail address used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions or non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or A24’s ongoing business relations. You can opt out of receiving text messages from us at any time by responding STOP to any text message we send you.

**B. Our "Do Not Track" Policy**

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is currently no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

**C. Cookies, Analytics, and Advertising Tracking Tools.**

As disclosed in Section 2 and Section 4 above, we and our partners automatically collect information about your devices and online interactions using tracking technologies like cookies, pixels, and web beacons, across time and across different platforms.  

We use Google Analytics to provide us with information about how you interact with the Sites and Services, so that we may customize and improve them for you. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.

We and our partners engage in interest-based advertising by using tracking tools to understand your online interactions over time and across different platforms in order to serve advertisements that are more tailored to your interests. To opt-out of tracking for interest-based advertising purposes from participating companies, visit both the Digital Advertising Alliance WebChoices tool at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) and the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out at [www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices). Please be aware that even if you opt out of interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive online ads.

Options you select and choices you make are browser-, website-, and device-specific. If you clear your cookies, you will need to set your preferences again.

8\. Your Privacy Rights.

**8.1 United States Privacy Rights**

California’s “Shine the Light” law permits consumers in California to request certain details about how their personal information is shared with third parties for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes, one time per year. A24 may share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain information about our compliance with this law, please e-mail us at [DPO@a24films.com](mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com), or send us a letter to A24 (Attn: Legal), 1245 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10001. Requests should include “Shine the Light Request” in the email subject line or the first line of the letter, and should include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Also, any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Services and who have posted content or information on the Sites or Services can request that such information be removed by sending an e-mail to [DPO@a24films.com](mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com). Requests must state that the user personally posted such content or information, and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view.

In addition, where provided for by applicable United States federal or state privacy laws, you may be entitled to exercise some or all of the rights described below with respect to your personal information:

* Do Not Sell My Personal Information or Share My Personal Information for Behavioral Advertising: You can opt-out of the “sale” and “sharing” of your personal information by clicking this [Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information](https://a24films.com/?a24_consent_prefs_open=true) link, or by using an opt-out preference signal or universal opt-out mechanism on a supported browser. Your selections are specific to the device, website, and browser you are using, so you should make your selections on every device and browser you use to access this website. Your selections are also deleted whenever you clear your browser’s cache.
* Limit the Use of my Sensitive Personal Information: In relation to any sensitive personal information identified in Section 2 above, you can request that we limit our use and sharing of such information only to those uses which are necessary to carry out our relationship with you (such as providing our goods and services that you’ve requested, maintaining the quality of our services, or protecting our services against illegal activity), or as otherwise described in relevant privacy laws.

We may deny certain requests, or fulfill a request only in part, based on our legal rights and obligations. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your request and would like to request further review, you may send an email to [DPO@a24films.com](mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com) with "Personal Information Requests Appeal" in the subject line.

As noted earlier, if you are an employee or contractor, your rights with respect to your personal information collected in the employment context will be described in a separate privacy notice that we provide to you where and when appropriate. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your U.S. privacy rights, such as by denying you goods or services, charging you a different price or rates for goods or services, or providing you a different level of quality of goods or service.  

How to Exercise Your United States Privacy Rights

Eligible individuals may request to exercise their privacy rights by submitting a request to us by either emailing us at [DPO@a24films.com](mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com) or sending a letter to A24 (Attn: Privacy), 1245 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10001, or clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link at the bottom of this webpage.

We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your requests. The verification steps may vary depending on the sensitivity of the personal information and whether you have an account with us.

Our legitimate interests include, without limitation, those interests described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, such as the effective and lawful operation of our business, promoting our products and the Services, and operating, protecting, and customizing our Sites. We also process your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests when responding to your requests, and when such processing is necessary for us to comply with any legal obligations. You have the right to object to processing of your personal information based on our legitimate interests.
* Legal Claims – it is possible that we may need to process your personal information in order to defend or establish a legal claim (for example, claims relating to the sale of our goods and services under contract law).

When processing is restricted, we can still store your information (for example, we keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be blocked to make sure the restriction is respected in future).
* The right to object: You have the right to object to certain types of processing, in particular processing based on our legitimate interests. You also can object at any time to your information being used for direct marketing purposes (including profiling related to such direct marketing).
* The right to refuse or withdraw consent: You have the right to refuse to provide, or to withdraw, your consent to processing of your personal information at any time with effect for future processing, when the processing is based on your consent.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, or if you have any questions or concerns regarding our processing of your personal information, please contact us at [DPO@a24films.com](mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com).

If you are a UK resident, you can make a complaint to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO): [https://ico.org.uk/concerns](https://ico.org.uk/concerns). Non-UK residents can find their local data protection authority here: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-e...](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en).

**8.3. Other Jurisdiction Privacy Rights**.

Depending on where you reside or access the Sites or Services from, you may have additional privacy rights available to you, similar to the United States and EEA/UK rights described in Sections 8.1 and 8.2. If available pursuant to applicable data protection law, you may contact us at [DPO@a24films.com](mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com) to make a request. We will respond in accordance with applicable data protection law.  

9\. Retention Period for Personal Information.  

We delete personal information within a reasonable period after we no longer need to use it for the purpose for which it was collected (or for any subsequent purpose that is compatible with the original purpose). We may archive personal information for a certain period prior to its final deletion, as part of our ordinary business continuity procedures. To determine the appropriate retention period with respect to any particular type of personal information, we rely on the following criteria: the necessity of the information to provide our services to our customers; the types and sensitivity of personal information being processed; regulatory requirements that we are subject to, including laws and regulations related to tax, employment, accounting, and securities; and whether a legal claim might be brought against us, for which the information would be relevant.  

10\. No Children Under 13.

The Sites and Services are intended for a general audience and not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age. A24 does not knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen (13) years of age. If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that we have inadvertently received personal information about a child under the age of 13, please email us at [DPO@a24films.com](mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com).

11\. International Transfers; Processing in the United States.

If you are accessing the Sites or Services from outside of the United States, please be aware that information collected through the Sites and Services will be transferred to, processed in, stored in, and used in the United States. Data protection laws in the United States may be different from those of your country of residence, and may not be as protective as those of your country of residence. When you provide personal information to us, you are consenting to the transfer of your personal information by both A24 and its Service Providers, including to the United States and other countries that do not have an adequacy decision from the European Commission (this means that the Commission has not determined that the laws of the United States and other countries provide legal protection equivalent to European Union data protection laws).

Our transfers of personal information outside of the EEA or UK are subject to contracts (including the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses) with our data processors, sub-processors, and Service Providers, which require such recipients to treat personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy and in compliance with applicable law.

12\. Data Security.

We take measures designed to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is never completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through our Sites or Services.

13\. Changes to this Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Service indicates your acknowledgment of the Privacy Policy then posted. If the changes are material, we may provide you additional notice.

14\. Contact Us.

If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, or would like to make a complaint about how we process your personal information, please e-mail us at [DPO@a24films.com](mailto:%20dpo@a24films.com), or send us a letter to A24, 1245 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10001.
