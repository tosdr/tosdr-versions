**11\. Additional Information for California Consumers**

This section provides additional disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).

**a)** Additional Information Related to Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Personal Information

We collect personal information from several sources: directly from you (for example, when you make purchases within the app or participate in a survey or contest); automatically when you use the app (for example, device information); and from other sources (for example, mobile measurement partners). We also generate inferences about you based on your use of the app and other information we collect.

In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers; internet or other electronic network activity information; characteristics of protected classifications under California or U.S. federal law (such as gender if you participate in a survey); commercial information (such as purchases you make in the app); approximate geolocation information (such as country); audio and visual information (such as videos you share with us if you participate in a contest); inferences; and other information that relates to or is reasonably capable of being associated with you. For details about the personal information we collect, please see [Section 2 (Categories of Personal Data that We Collect, Purposes and Legal Bases for Our Processing)](#Section2) above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes listed in the chart in [Section 2](#Section2) above.

We may share your personal information with the categories of third parties as described in [Section 5](#Section5) above. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for business purposes: identifiers, internet and electronic network activity information, characteristics of protected classifications under California or U.S. federal law; commercial information; approximate geolocation information; and other information that we have inferred about you or that relates to or is reasonably capable of being associated with you.

We do not sell your personal information. We do allow our advertising partners to collect certain device identifiers and electronic network activity via our app to show ads that are based on your interests. If you prefer to limit this activity, your device may include a feature (such as “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS, or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through mobile apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.

**b)** Rights of California Consumers

* Request more details about the categories and specific pieces of personal information that we process.
    
* Request the deletion of their personal information.

* Not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights.
    

If you’re a California consumer, to exercise these rights, or if you have any other questions about privacy or data protection at Bending Spoons, you can contact us by sending an email to [privacy@bendingspoons.com](mailto:privacy@bendingspoons.com). We may take steps to verify your request by asking you to provide information that matches information we have on file about you. California consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf, but we will require proof that the person is authorized to act on their behalf and may also still ask them to verify their identity with us directly.

**12\. In-app Tracking Technologies**

When we refer to “tracking technology/technologies” in this Policy, we mean any technology that stores or accesses information on the user’s device, including SDKs, tracking pixel, HTML5 local storage, local shared object, and fingerprinting technique.

Tracking technologies are usually classified by purpose (Technical, Analytics, Profiling) or by publisher (First-party, Third-party).

This classification is important because different legal requirements apply based on how the tracking technologies are classified.

Below you will find the types of tracking technologies as classified with some practical examples.

_**By purpose**_

_**Technical tracking technologies**_

Technical tracking technologies are used for the purpose of transmitting messages over an electronic communication network or to provide a service specifically requested by the user.

Thus, technical tracking technologies are essential for the correct functioning of the app and to provide the service offered to and requested by the user.

For example, technical tracking technologies can be used to monitor sessions, store specific server access information related to the user configuration, facilitate the use of online content, or keep track of items in a shopping cart or information used to fill in a form.

Technical tracking technologies do not need your consent.

_**Analytics tracking technologies**_

Analytics tracking technologies may be used to assess the effectiveness of an information society service provided by a publisher, evaluate and improve the design of an app, or help measure its traffic.

In other words, analytics tracking technologies may be used to track the traffic and performance of an app, by collecting aggregate data on the number of users and how they interact with the app to improve its services.

For example, analytics tracking technologies may collect information about how users access an app, including the number of users, possibly grouped by geographical area, time slot, how long users stay on the app, what parts of the app they interact with, or the number of users who used a particular feature.

Analytics tracking technologies need your explicit consent. However, analytics tracking technologies are equated to technical trackers and, thus, do not need your consent if:

* they are only used to produce aggregated statistics that are performed by way of the controller’s own resources and do not turn into activities that go beyond statistical counting and enable business-related decision-making; or
    
* the third parties do not match the analytics trackers' data with any other information and do not forward such data to other third parties.
    

_**Profiling tracking technologies**_

Profiling tracking technologies may be used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to users and trace specific actions or recurring behavioral patterns in the use of the offered functionalities back to specific, identified or identifiable individuals for the purpose of grouping them within homogeneous, multi-sized clusters. This is aimed to enable the company to analyze and predict personal aspects concerning the users, provide them with increasingly customized services beyond what is strictly necessary for the delivery of the service, and also send targeted advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the user during their in-app activities.

In other words, profiling tracking technologies may be used to convey behavioral advertising, measure the effectiveness of ads, or to customize the services offered in line with the user’s monitored behavior.

For example, profiling tracking technologies can be used to create user profiles and offer content in line with the user’s interests, send targeted ads or messages, conduct statistical analysis or other research activities to improve our products and services and measure the effectiveness of our campaigns.

Profiling tracking technologies need your explicit consent.

_**By publisher**_

**_First-party_ tracking technologies**

First-party tracking technologies are installed and managed directly by the owner of the app which will process the collected data for its own purposes.

**_Third-party_ tracking technologies**

Third-party tracking technologies are installed and managed by different apps or developers either for our purposes or for the third party’s own purposes.

The data collected by these third parties is governed by their own specific privacy policies and terms and conditions over which we have no control. Thus, for further information about this data processing activities, please refer to the privacy policy of such third parties as indicated in the following section ("_Types of tracking technologies used by the app_”).

Third-party non-anonymized analytics and/or profiling trackers need your consent. You can manage this consent at any time by accessing the “Privacy Settings” within the app.

However, you can opt out of the further processing of your data collected by means of such trackers by sending an email to [privacy@bendingspoons.com](mailto:privacy@bendingspoons.com).
