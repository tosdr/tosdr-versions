### GDPR Rights Requests 

#### Special Note to the Cornell Community:

GDPR rights requests are centrally managed through Cornell University CIT. This is to ensure consistency, transparency, and accountability in our university response.

#### Note to our European Constituents:

If you are located within the European Economic Area (“EEA,” European Union member states, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland), we acknowledge the rights granted to you under the GDPR. If you are located in the United Kingdom (U.K.), which has left the European Union, but has adopted legislation substantially similar to the GDPR, we acknowledge the rights granted to you under the Data Protection Act of 2018.  

For purposes of this note:

* GDPR means the European Union’s General Data Processing Regulation;
* With respect to individuals in the U.K., references to “GDPR” should be read as referring to the U.K.’s similar legislation, “the Data Protection Act of 2018”;
* “Personal data” means information relating to an identified or identifiable individual who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by use of any identifier or factor specific to that individual; and 
* “GDPR processing activities” means the collection, use, processing or sharing of personal data when those activities are within the scope of GDPR.  

**Please note that, depending on the situation, some of the processing of personal data we do in the various circumstances described in this statement may not fall within the scope of the GDPR or the Data Protection Act of 2018.**

Upon your reasonable, good faith request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal data as part of our GDPR processing activities, to the extent required and in accordance with applicable law.  In certain cases, you may also have a right, with respect to your personal data collected and used in GDPR processing activities, to:

1. access your information held by us;
2. correct inaccurate or incorrect information about you;
3. the erasure of your information when it is no longer necessary for us to retain it;
4. restrict processing of your personal information in specific situations;
5. object to processing your information, including sending you communications that may be considered direct-marketing materials;
6. object to automated decision-making and profiling, where applicable; and
7. complain to a supervisory authority in your EEA jurisdiction.

Subject to certain legal limits, you also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data as part of our GDPR processing activities, where our processing is solely based on your consent.  However, in certain cases, we may continue to process your personal data after you have withdrawn consent, if we have a legal basis to do so. For example, we may retain certain data if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, if we still need the data for the lawful purposes for which we obtained the data, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping our services and operations safe and secure or to safeguard our rights or the rights or safety of others.  

If you wish to exercise your rights or have other questions or concerns related to your rights under the GDPR, fill out the [Request Form](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/webform/contact-us "Contact Us") or call [(607) 255-5500](tel:+6072555500)
