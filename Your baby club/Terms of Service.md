###### Emergency Childbirth: How to Deliver a Baby Yourself Safely

I will preface this article with the fact that I am a big believer in the human body’s ability to birth babies. Equally, I am a big believer in having a care provider who is there and supportive of your birth but who can help with any possible interventions if needed. In one article, I cannot teach you what I or other care providers have learned in the 4-7+ years of schooling we have undergone.

###### Fetal Macrosomia: What Happens When Your Baby Is Too Big

Fetal Macrosomia is when a baby is born at a much higher birth weight than average. Babies who are considered to have Macrosomia are born at 8lbs 13oz or more, which only occurs about 9% worldwide. In many cases, individuals can birth “big babies” vaginally, but in some cases, a cesarean section might want to be considered. The first thing that I want to note is that ultrasound technology is generally incorrect when it comes to measurements of a fetus. Typically, they seem to overestimate or und](https://www.yourbabyclub.com/fetal-macrosomia-what-happens-when-your-baby-is-too-big-209)

We always hear people stating, “Sleep when the baby sleeps,” and chuck at the seeming impossibility of it, but why do they say this? You have just labored for countless hours to birth your baby, or you have had surgery to birth your baby, you are tired, possibly coming off of drugs, and yet there is this tiny newborn who needs your love, attention, milk, and snuggles.

###### Placenta Previa

Typically, the placenta position in the uterus does not lead to any concerns or problems. The first thing your ultrasound tech will tell you about your placenta is whether it is anterior or posterior. Anterior placentas are on the front of your uterus. They can make it more difficult to feel kicks and movements in early pregnancy and more challenging for your baby to be heard on a Doppler or baby monitor. There is nothing wrong with an anterior placenta, but many individuals report different ex](https://www.yourbabyclub.com/placenta-previa-559)

###### Mastering the Art of Pushing: Essential Tips for a Smooth Labor

As with describing what contractions feel like, explaining how to push during labor can be challenging. In my practice, each first-time parent gets the idea to click with different suggestions and techniques. It can be even more difficult to figure out how to push if you have received an epidural because you will not be feeling much more than pressure, and in some cases, you will feel nothing at all.  What Is "Pushing"?
