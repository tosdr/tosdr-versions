Yes, that even means pregnancy symptoms are not in this article or on this list. Yes, that even means pregnancy symptoms that you have been told are likely normal but do not feel normal to you. If it is concerning you, causing a lack of sleep or anxiety, and your gut is telling you that something is wrong, listen to that and contact your care provider.

###### Your Complete Guide to Pregnancy Dreams

Dreaming Vividly During Pregnancy People who are pregnant often report more vivid dreams and nightmares, as well as better recall of these nightly events. One of the reasons dreams may be more intense during pregnancy is because of the increase in hormones. Hormones impact emotions, anxieties, and moods, affecting how brains process this information. Often, this way of processing occurs at night when one is sleeping. For some, the increase in dreams can be exciting and something to embrace.
