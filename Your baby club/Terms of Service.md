###### Sleep Deprivation Unveiled: Why Ignoring It Is Risky Business!

We always hear people stating, “Sleep when the baby sleeps,” and chuck at the seeming impossibility of it, but why do they say this? You have just labored for countless hours to birth your baby, or you have had surgery to birth your baby, you are tired, possibly coming off of drugs, and yet there is this tiny newborn who needs your love, attention, milk, and snuggles. It is no wonder that sleep deprivation in the immediate postpartum poses a risk to many new parents trying to find balance in thi](https://www.yourbabyclub.com/sleep-deprivation-unveiled-why-ignoring-it-is-risky-business-208)

###### Placenta Previa

Typically, the placenta position in the uterus does not lead to any concerns or problems. The first thing your ultrasound tech will tell you about your placenta is whether it is anterior or posterior. Anterior placentas are on the front of your uterus. They can make it more difficult to feel kicks and movements in early pregnancy and more challenging for your baby to be heard on a Doppler or baby monitor. There is nothing wrong with an anterior placenta, but many individuals report different ex](https://www.yourbabyclub.com/placenta-previa-559)

###### Mastering the Art of Pushing: Essential Tips for a Smooth Labor

As with describing what contractions feel like, explaining how to push during labor can be challenging. In my practice, each first-time parent gets the idea to click with different suggestions and techniques. It can be even more difficult to figure out how to push if you have received an epidural because you will not be feeling much more than pressure, and in some cases, you will feel nothing at all.  What Is "Pushing"?

As you get to the end of your pregnancy, it can feel challenging to sit in the unknown and wait for your baby to come. In general, I believe babies know their birthdays and that due dates are just a number, not something to stress over. Many OBGYNs are big at pushing for induction between 39-41 weeks. You can always say "no" or simply not show up for the induction, but for some individuals, fighting their provider feels like too much emotional work at the end of pregnancy.
