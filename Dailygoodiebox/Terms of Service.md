Terms of Service
----------------

  
  
1\. Introduction.  
  

1.1. Agreement. Welcome to Daily Goodie Box! LUXEads Pty Ltd ("Daily Goodie Box" or "**Company**") recommends that you ("**you**") read the following terms and conditions carefully. By accessing or using the Daily Goodie Box website, the Daily Goodie Box Service, including any software applications made available by Daily Goodie Box (together, the "**Website**" or "**Service**"), however accessed or used, you agree to be bound by these terms (the "**Terms of Service**" or the "**Agreement**"), which constitute a legally binding agreement between Daily Goodie Box and you concerning your use of the Service. We encourage you to print the Agreement or save it to your computer for reference.

1.2. Separate Privacy Policy. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have read and understood, and agree to be bound by, this Agreement and LUXEads Pty Ltd's Privacy Policy (the "**Privacy Policy**"), which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. The Privacy Policy is available at http://dailygoodiebox.com/privacy.

1.3. **No Permission Without Agreement. If you do not understand this Agreement, or do not agree to be bound by it or the Privacy Policy, you may not access or use the Service, and you must immediately cease accessing or using the Service.**

1.4. **Arbitration and Remedies. These terms contain a mandatory arbitration of disputes provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute. See below for full details.**

  
  
2\. Dispute Resolution. By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of certain information about you, as specified in the Privacy Policy discussed in Section 1.3 (Separate Privacy Policy). Daily Goodie Box encourages users of the Service to frequently check the Privacy Policy for changes.

2.1 Binding Arbitration.  
  

2.1.1. If you and Daily Goodie Box cannot resolve a Claim through negotiations, either party may elect to have the Claim finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. “Claim(s)” shall mean all claims, actions, demands, causes of action, and other proceedings, including but not limited to legal costs and fees. **Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s).**

2.1.2. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted through JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) under the Streamlined Rules, as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. All remedies available to the parties under applicable federal, state, or local laws shall remain available in arbitration. The parties shall each participate in the selection of a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the Streamlined Rules. Unless you and Company agree otherwise in writing, the final arbitration hearing shall take place in person at the JAMS facility located in or nearest to your city of residence. If you initiate arbitration against Company, you will be required to pay an initial fee of $250 (unless you qualify for a waiver), and all other arbitration costs (including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services) shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator. If Company initiates arbitration against you, Company shall pay all costs associated with the arbitration. If JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate a dispute or claim, you and Company agree to arbitrate using an alternative arbitral forum. Regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, you and Company will each pay your own attorney’s fees and costs unless an award of attorney’s fees is available under applicable statute. The arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each Claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Either party may litigate to compel arbitration in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. **You agree that without the terms above and below, you would have the right to sue in court with a jury trial or participate in a class action.**

2.2 Waiver of Class Actions and Joinder of Claims.  
  

2.2.1. **You and Daily Goodie Box agree that any arbitration shall be limited to each Claim individually. You and Daily Goodie Box agree that each may only bring claims against the other in your or Daily Goodie Box's individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You and Daily Goodie Box knowingly and voluntarily waive any right to proceed in a class action or representative proceeding or to join claims or sue in court with a jury.**

2.2.2. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, the Claim will still be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration upon the election of either party, and any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s). In addition: (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration, and (2) there is no right for any Claim to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to employ class action procedures, and (3) there is no right of authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf either of the general public or any other individuals.

2.3. Remedies in Aid of Arbitration; Equitable Relief. This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or Daily Goodie Box from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration, or confirm an arbitral award, from a Court of Competent Jurisdiction. Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or Daily Goodie Box from applying to a Court of Competent Jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary. "Court of Competent Jurisdiction" means any federal or state court: (1) that has jurisdiction over the subject matter; and (2) that is located in San Francisco, California.

Choice of Law and Venue. This Agreement, including without limitation this Agreement's interpretation, shall be treated as though this Agreement were executed and performed in the State of California, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law principles. The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party. **The proper venue for any judicial action arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement, if authorized herein, will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The parties stipulate to, and agree to waive any objection to, the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts, and further expressly submit to extraterritorial service of process.**

2.4. Choice of Law and Venue. This Agreement, including without limitation this Agreement's interpretation, shall be treated as though this Agreement were executed and performed in the State of California, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law principles. The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party. **The proper venue for any judicial action arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement, if authorized herein, will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The parties stipulate to, and agree to waive any objection to, the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts, and further expressly submit to extraterritorial service of process.**
