### 10\. Dispute Resolution

A printed version of these Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the website or service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.

Any controversy or claim brought or arising out of or relating to these terms or your use of this website or service shall be resolved by a single impartial arbitrator pursuant to proceedings administered by the American Arbitration Association under its rules for resolution of commercial disputes. Any such claims shall be brought solely by you as an individual and not as part of, or as a representative of, a class. All submissions to the arbitrator, the proceedings and the award shall be confidential. The arbitration shall be conducted on an expedited basis with minimal discovery. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding.

The prevailing party in the arbitration shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of their reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts or state courts located in the Fourth District of Minnesota. Use of the website or service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these terms, including without limitation, this section.

### 11\. Integration and Severability

These terms are the entire agreement between you and Sharpened with respect to the website or service, and your use therein, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Sharpened with respect to said access and use. If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.

### 12\. Indemnification

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sharpened from and against all claims arising from or in any way related to your use of the website or service, a violation by you of these terms, or any other actions connected with your use of our aforementioned content, including any liability or expense, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees. Sharpened will provide prompt written notice of any such claims, but failure to provide such notice will not release you from any of your obligations pursuant to this section except to the extent that you are actually prejudiced by such failure, and will not relieve you from any other liability that you may have to Sharpened other than under this section.

### 13\. Miscellaneous

Sharpened shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Sharpened’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including "line-noise" interference). These terms are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with Sharpened's prior written consent. Sharpened may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these terms and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. All notices under these terms will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. The captions and headings in this agreement are intended only for convenience, and will in no event be construed to define, limit or describe the scope or intent of this agreement, or of any provision of this agreement, nor in any way affect the interpretation of these terms.
