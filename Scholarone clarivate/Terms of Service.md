Terms of Use



These Terms of Use govern your use of the Clarivate web pages and products (each a “Site”) that link to these Terms

of Use as well as services or Data offered in those Sites by Clarivate (“we”, “us”, “our” or “Clarivate”). By using a Site,

you are agreeing to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms of Use. We may change these Terms of Use at

any time without notice to you. Your use of a Site after any changes have been posted will constitute your agreement

to the modified Terms of Use and all of the changes. Accordingly, you should read these Terms of Use from time to time

for any changes.

Some of the Sites have additional terms that relate to specific products or services you are using, available at

http://terms.clarivate.com. If you are accessing a Site pursuant to a separate agreement between Clarivate and you,

your employer, or your academic institution (your “License Agreement”), your use of the Site is also governed by that

License Agreement. The additional product and service terms and your License Agreement (collectively “Additional Terms”)

will take precedence in the event of a conflict with these Terms of Use. If you would like to understand more about all of

the rights that you have to use the Site or our Data (as defined below), you should ask your employer or academic

institution, or you should contact our Global Customer Support Center.

1. Ownership

a. Intellectual property. The Site contains proprietary technology and copyright material owned by Clarivate

and/or our third-party licensors. All use of the reports, graphics, images, documents, materials, or other content

accessible on our Sites (“Data”) is restricted and must comply with these Terms of Use and, as applicable, the

Additional Terms. More information can be found in our Copyright Notice.

b. Trademarks. 'Clarivate’ and our product and service names are trade or service marks of Clarivate or its

affiliated companies. All other product and service names cited are trademarks of their respective owners. More

information about fair use, general use and a list of Clarivate marks can be found in our Trademark Notice.

c. Usage information. We may collect information related to your use of our Sites. We may use this information

for legitimate business reasons including without limitation to recommend products, services or functionality

that may interest you, to test and improve our products and to protect and enforce our rights under these

Terms of Use, and may pass this information to our third-party providers for the same purposes

2. Your rights of use

a. License. Clarivate grants you a limited license to access and make personal use of the Site, subject to these

Terms of Use.

b. Restrictions. The Site and Data may not be used, reproduced, duplicated, copied, downloaded, scraped, sold,

resold, visited, reverse engineered, decompiled, merged, disassembled, distributed, transformed, or otherwise

exploited, in whole or in part (including via hyperlink), including to create derivative works or for any

commercial purpose without the express written consent of Clarivate. You may not use any robots, spiders,

3. Licensed products

a. Limited access. Certain parts of the Site provide access to products or services that require a separate license

or subscription from Clarivate (each a “Product”) and are accessible only by using access or login credentials.

If you have not been issued with access or login information by us, your academic institution, or your employer

you should not use that Product. You may not disclose your login token, password, or any other authentication

information in order to access our Products. You are responsible for all activities that occur in connection with

your login credentials, and you agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or

account.

b. Internal Use. You may use our Products only for your own internal business purposes subject to these Terms

of Use and, as applicable, the Additional Terms. Where Products provide you with access to Data, subject to the

restrictions in 2(b), you will generally be entitled to (i) search, access, download and print reasonable amounts

of Data reasonably required for your own work use and for your employer’s internal business purposes; (ii)

distribute copies of Data to other individuals who you know are users of the Product within your organization;

(iii) include insubstantial portions of Data as incidental samples or for illustrative or demonstration purposes,

including in reports prepared for internal business purposes and provided that you include the following

acknowledgement: “Source: Clarivate.” We determine a “reasonable amount” of Data by comparing your

download activity against the average annual download rates for all Clarivate clients using the Product. We

determine an “insubstantial portion” of downloaded Data to mean an amount of Data taken from the Product

which (1) would not have significant commercial value of its own; and (2) would not act as a substitute for

access to a Clarivate product for someone who does not have access to that product.

c. Retention. You must cease accessing the Product and delete all Data obtained from such Product once your

license to the Product ends.

4. User content

a. User material. The Site may have features which allow you to comment on, engage in discussions or otherwise

upload, submit, or post content, information, graphics, videos, images, or links to the Product (collectively, "User

Material"). User Material is subject to these Terms of Use and as applicable, the Additional Terms. You hereby

agree not to upload, submit or post any User Material that (i) is abusive, illegal, defamatory, indecent, obscene,

offensive or threatening in any way; (ii) is unrelated to the Product; (iii) violates anyone’s copyright, trademark or

other proprietary right; (iv) interferes with the privacy of another user; (v) contains a virus or any other harmful

components; (vi) contains false or misleading statements; or (vii) gives rise to any liability or violates any applicable

local, state, federal or international law or regulation. When uploading, submitting and/or posting User Material,

it’s your responsibility to ensure that you have all the necessary legal rights to upload, submit or post your User

Material. We are under no obligation to separately review any User Material to check that you have the right to

carry out such activities. We may remove User Material if it breaches these Terms of Use or is otherwise illegal or

infringing any third party’s rights without consultation or notification.

b. License. We acknowledge that, as between us and you, intellectual property rights in the User Material are owned

by you or your licensors. Where you upload User Material to a Product, you grant us permission to use, store and

process User Material in accordance with applicable law, including to sublicense the same to our subcontractors

as required. Further, when you post, comment, or otherwise upload User Material to a public or semi-public Site,

including but not limited to a community page or blog, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use,

publish, broadcast, and reproduce such User Material without limitation in any and all media, worldwide, in

perpetuity, for any purpose whatsoever. Where you provide any comments, recommendation, suggestion or ideas,

or any other feedback related to our products, data, or services ("Feedback") we may use and exploit such

Feedback without restriction or obligation to you and you will not obtain any rights in our products, data, or

services. We may retain the User Material for the same purposes after you have ceased using the Site.
