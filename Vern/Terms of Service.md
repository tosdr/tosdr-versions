Rules

[#rules](#rules)

We, like you, enjoy freedom, and we wish to respect our members' rights to free speech. However, we must restrict that right under circumstances in which it would directly harm us or this service. We also have ideological views that are important to us and our users. Therefore:

1. Do not attempt to disrupt ~vern's ability to provide any of our services. This includes, but isn't limited to: attempting to [cryptomine](https://wl.vern.cc/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Mining) in the tilde, spamming e-mail or in the official matrix rooms, or attempting to distribute malware.
2. Respect the American and Canadian legislation. Some examples of unacceptable behavior in accordance to the law include, but are not limited to: harassment, scam attempts, and unauthorized copying and/or distribution of copyrighted content.
3. Due to online privacy laws such as COPPA, you must be 13 years or older to sign up for ~vern. Additionally if you are from the EU, you have to be at least 16 years of age as mandated by the GDPR.
4. Any and all software or **original** and **nontrivial** user content hosted on **our servers** must be licensed under a free (as in freedom) license.
5. No discrimination of any kind. Repeated violations of this rule even after warning will result in a ban.
