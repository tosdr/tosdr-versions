Ureed will notify you that your Account is Inactive by sending an email to your registered email address and give you the option of keeping your Account open and maintaining the balance or withdrawing the balance. If, within thirty (30) days of such notice, your Account has no activity, Ureed will automatically deduct the entire balance of your Account.

11.4 If your Account has a negative amount of funds, we may:

1. a. set-off the negative amount of funds with funds that you subsequently receive into your Account;

3. c. reverse payments you have made from your Account to other User Accounts on the Platform;
4. d. deduct amounts you owe us from money you subsequently add or receive into your Account; or
5. e. immediately suspend or limit your Account until such time as your Account no longer has a negative amount.

In the event that we offset a negative amount of funds pursuant to this section, it may be bundled with another debit coming out of your Account.

11.5 Ureed reserves the right to collect any funds owed to us by any other legal means.

11.6 You acknowledge and agree that:

1. a. we are not a bank or other licensed financial institution and do not provide banking services or any financial services to you;
2. b. the funds shown in your Account (which may include Milestone Payments and/or any prepayment of fees and charges which you owe to us) represent our unsecured obligations to you with respect to your rights to direct us to make payment in relation to the purchase and sale of Service Provider’s Services through the Platform and provision of the Service Provider’s Services;
3. c. to the extent that we are required to release funds from your Account to you, you will become our unsecured creditor until such funds are paid to you;
4. d. we are not acting as a trustee or fiduciary with respect to such funds or payments;
5. e. the amount of funds showing in your Account is not insured and is not a guaranteed deposit;
6. f. funds may only loaded into your Account, or released from your Account, by us and you must only use the mechanisms available on the Platform to pay for, or receive funds in respect of Service Provider Services;
7. g. we will hold funds in respect of the amount of your Account (including Milestone Payments) in an account held by us with a financial institution (or in any manner that we decide in our sole discretion from time to time) and such funds are not segregated into a separate account; and
8. h. we may commingle your funds with funds of other User’s and our own funds and such commingled funds could be used to pay other Users or for our general corporate purposes or otherwise, however, we will remain obliged to release or refund funds at your direction in accordance with this Agreement.
