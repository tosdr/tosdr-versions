Cookie policy
=============

This cookie policy (“Policy”) describes what cookies are and how they’re being used by the U[reed.com](https://ureed.com/) website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and Ureed.com LTD (“Ureed.com LTD”, “we”, “us” or “our”). You should read this Policy so you can understand the types of cookies we use, the information we collect using cookies and how that information is used.

For further information on how we use, store and keep your personal data secure, see our [privacy policy](http://34.247.38.2privacy/).

What are cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer or other devices when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”).

Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they expire when you close the web browser.

Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our Website and remain on your desktop or mobile device even after you close your browser or restart your computer. They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for you while visiting the Website and Services.

Cookies may be set by the Website (“first-party cookies”), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the Website (“third party cookies”). These third parties can recognize you when you visit our website and also when you visit certain other websites. You may learn more about cookies and how they work [here](https://www.websitepolicies.com/blog/cookies).

Your web browser may request advertisements directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their website.

Do we use web beacons or tracking pixels?
-----------------------------------------

Our emails may contain a “web beacon” (or “tracking pixel”) to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links or advertisements within the email.

We may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to users and to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them.

The pixel will be deleted when you delete the email. If you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should read the email in plain text view or with images disabled.
