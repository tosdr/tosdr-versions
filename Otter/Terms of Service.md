You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times, and that you have all necessary rights and approvals to provide such information. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password.

* Use it in compliance with your organization’s terms and policies. Please note that Otter Basic Workspace, Pro Workspace, Otter Business and Enterprise accounts are subject to the Organization’s control. The Organization administrators may prevent you from later disassociating your account from the Organization account.

* Acknowledge that all the data under your account is owned by the Workspace or Organization and the Workspace or Organization administrators have the right to access, disclose, restrict and remove information in your account. This includes the data that predates when you joined the Workspace or Organization account.

#### **4\. General Payment Terms.**‍

Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have the opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable.

**4.1 Price.** Otter.ai reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Otter.ai will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Otter.ai may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Otter.ai gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Otter.ai, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Otter.ai’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.

**4.2 Authorization.** You authorize Otter.ai and its third party payment processors to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Otter.ai, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Otter.ai or its third party payment processors may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. At its discretion Otter may allow an organization to purchase the Service by issuing an invoice for payment that must be settled within 30 days of issuance.

**4.3 Subscription Service.**

a. **General**. The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“**Subscription Service**”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Otter.ai or its third party payment processors or Apple or Google if you subscribed directly through the mobile application to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums, including all accrued sums for your Authorized Users. The “**Subscription Billing Date**” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For more information on the “**Subscription Fee**”, please see [https://otter.ai/pricing](https://otter.ai/pricing). Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period, which may be one month or one year depending on the selection you make on your account (such period, the “**Initial Subscription Period**”). The term of each Subscription Service will automatically renew for a period equal to the Initial Subscription Period or one (1) year periods, whichever is less, unless otherwise identified in an applicable Order Form (each, a “Renewal Term”) unless a party provides the other party written notice thirty (30) days in advance of the expiry of the Subscription Service or then-current Renewal Term, as applicable, of its desire to amend the duration of the Renewal Term, modify number of Users or terminate the Order Form. Customer is responsible and will pay Otter all Subscription Fees under an Order Form for the entire Subscription Term and any applicable Renewal Term. If you may add additional users to Teams accounts throughout the Subscription Period you will be charged a pro-rata fee for the time remaining to the renewal period. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. Otter.ai or its third party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service in the settings page for your account at Otter.ai if you signed up directly via our website, or through settings in the Apple App Store, or Google Play Store if you subscribed directly in the mobile application or contacting us at: [support@otter.ai](mailto:support@otter.ai).

**4.4 Delinquent Accounts.** Otter.ai may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any sums are due but unpaid. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if you have been provided access to the Service (including certain features thereof) via your Organization and your Organization has not paid all sums due, we may suspend or terminate your access to the Service. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account may be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees.

#### **5\. Licenses**

**5.1 Limited License.** Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Otter.ai grants you, solely for your personal, non-commercial use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to: (a) install and use one object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Service obtained from a legitimate marketplace on a mobile device that you own or control; and (b) access and use the Service.

As between you and Otter.ai, data that you enter into or upload to the Service is and will remain owned by you.  You hereby grant Otter.ai the right to collect, process, transmit, store, use, and disclose data to provide the Service and as otherwise set forth in these Terms and the [Otter.ai Privacy Policy](https://otter.ai/privacy). When you join a Basic Workspace, Pro Workspace, Business or Enterprise Organization, your data is owned by the Workspace or Organization, as applicable, as specified in section 3.2 above.

**18.4 Use of Aggregated Data**. You acknowledge and agree that Otter.ai may collect, create, process, transmit, store, use, and disclose aggregated and/or deidentified data derived from Data or use of the Services (“**Aggregated Data**”) for its business purposes, including for machine learning and training, industry analysis, benchmarking, and analytics. All Aggregated Data will be in an aggregated and/or deidentified form only and will not identify you. Nothing in these Terms gives you any rights in or to any part of the Service or Aggregated Data.

**18.5 Compliance**. You are solely responsible (a) for Data as entered into, supplied, accessed, or used by you and (b) for complying with any privacy and data protection laws and regulations applicable to Data or your use of the Service.  You represent and warrant that you have obtained and will maintain all rights, consents, and authorizations required to grant Otter.ai the rights and licenses set forth in Section 18 and to enable Otter.ai to exercise its rights under the same without violation or infringement of the rights of any third party.

**18.6 Information Security**. Otter.ai will employ commercially reasonable security measures that are designed to protect Data in its possession or control against unlawful or unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure.

#### **19\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

**19.1 Generally**. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Otter.ai in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 19.2 and 19.3, you and Otter.ai agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OTTER.AI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

**19.2 Exceptions**. Despite the provisions of Section 19.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

**19.3 Opt-Out**. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 19 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Otter.ai, Inc., Attention: Legal Department -Arbitration Opt-Out, 800 W El Camino Real, Suite 170, Mountain View, CA 94040 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Otter.ai receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 19 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 20.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

**19.4 Arbitrator**. Any arbitration between you and Otter.ai will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “**AAA Rules**”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Otter.ai. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

**19.5 Notice of Arbitration; Process**. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice of Arbitration**”). Otter.ai’s address for Notice is: Otter.ai, Inc., 800 W El Camino Real, Suite 170, Mountain View, CA 94040. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Otter.ai may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Otter.ai must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Otter.ai in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Otter.ai will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.

**19.6 Fees**. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Otter.ai will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Otter.ai for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

**19.7 No Class Actions**. YOU AND OTTER.AI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Otter.ai agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

**19.8 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision**. If Otter.ai makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Otter.ai’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Otter.ai’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Otter.ai will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

**19.9 Enforceability**. If Section 19.7 or the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, or if Otter.ai receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

#### **20\. Miscellaneous**

**20.1 General Terms**. These Terms, together with the [Privacy Policy](https://otter.ai/privacy) and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Otter.ai regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

**20.2 Governing Law**. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles.
