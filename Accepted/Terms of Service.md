This agreement is between
-------------------------

**Get Accepted, Inc.**

a limited liability company, d/b/a Accepted

(hereinafter referred to as “Accepted”)

\- and -

**The Signatory below**

(hereinafter referred to as “the Client”)

OF THE SECOND PART.

**WHEREAS** Accepted carries on the business of providing a comprehensive menu of consulting services to students applying to MBA, law school, medical school, graduate school, or undergraduate programs of his/her choice;

**AND WHEREAS** the Client wishes to purchase certain services offered by Accepted;

**AND WHEREAS** `Accepted` and the Client wish to set out the mutually agreed upon terms of the Client’s purchase of consulting services offered by Accepted.

In consideration of the mutual covenants expressed in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree with each other as follows:

### I. CONSULTING SERVICE

The Client agrees to purchase the services from Accepted chosen at the end of this contract. (hereafter “Services”).

### II. FEES

The fee structure, including hourly rates, for Services purchased by Client is set out on the Accepted.com web site. Client acknowledges and agrees that it is their responsibility to pay in full for the Services under this Agreement, independent of the results s/he obtains with respect to any admissions application. Further, Client acknowledges and agrees that any amount that s/he has paid and/or is obligated to pay to Accepted under this Agreement is non-refundable and non-transferrable under any circumstances.

#### Package Services

All packages must be used and completed within the May 1-April 30th admissions season chosen at the end of this contract, with the exception of multi-year packages specifically outlined on the services page. If a school the Client applied to as part of that package has not yet reached a final determination on the Client’s candidacy by April 30th, Accepted will continue to offer support until it does.

As for the purchase of Accepted package services, the Client acknowledges that the fee for such services is non-refundable. If, by April 30th of the current admissions season, the Client does not utilize the services at all, the client acknowledges that all payments will be forfeited. Unused services cannot be deferred to the following admissions season under any circumstances.

#### Hourly Services

As for the purchase of hourly services, subject to the Termination provisions herein, Accepted requires a minimum purchase of two hours of hourly services. Additional hours can be purchased in one hour increments. Hourly services will expire after six (6) months of the date of purchase. If the Client does not complete the application process in a given admissions season but returns to Accepted to utilize the hourly services in the subsequent admissions season, the Client will pay for hourly services in the subsequent admissions season at the hourly rates then applicable. Accepted will not refund or defer any of the Client’s unused time.

Note: Clients who select Package services cannot then switch to or add Hourly services. Clients who purchase Hourly services may switch to Package services but any hourly fees already paid are not applicable to the Package fee.

### III. ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITIES

3. exercise good faith efforts to return Client requests or phone calls within two (2) Business Days; and
4. exercise good faith efforts to respond to all written work submitted by Client within two (2) Business Days.

Any document submitted to the Consultant between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. will be returned to the Client before 9:00 p.m. as indicated day in the table below. All inquiries made and documents sent after 9:00 p.m. Eastern on a Business Day will be considered to have been received as of the next Business Day. For example, if an essay is submitted to the Consultant at 9:30 p.m. on Monday, the submission day/time will be considered Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. and the edited essay will be returned to the Client by Thursday at 9:00 p.m.

2. that Accepted is not obliged to prepare or draft application materials, including any supporting documentation or written materials that will form part of any application for admission;
3. that Accepted is not obliged to perform the administrative work of formatting application material, although Accepted is obliged to offer formatting suggestions and guidance;
4. that Accepted is not obliged to edit work that has been written, rewritten or edited by a third party;
5. that Accepted is not obliged to line-edit recommendations, whether written by the recommender or by the applicant, but will give broader feedback and advice on the recommendation;
6. that Accepted is not obliged to edit essays more than 50% over the stated word limit;
7. that Accepted does not provide complimentary ding reviews at the end of hourly or package services and that ding reviews are only available for purchase according to the hourly fees set forth in Schedule A attached hereto;
8. that once the Client commences any work on any application within a package offering, the Client has committed to completing this application and cannot start a different application later in the engagement in its place.
9. that Accepted is not obligated to prepare clients for interviews until the client has received an interview invitation from the school.
10. that Client’s relationship is with Accepted and not with any of its individual employees or contractors and Client will therefore not directly or indirectly engage or solicit any individual or entity providing any of the Services on behalf of Accepted to provide any Services to client or any other person or entity.
11. that Accepted works with a single client, the applicant, who is designated to receive the services. Unless you are a recommender purchasing a letter of recommendation service or an applicant purchasing a letter of recommendation service for your recommender, our client is always the applicant.

### V. NO WARRANTIES

CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, BY REASON OF THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND SUCH OTHER PROCESSES INVOLVING STUDENT ENTRY INTO THE WORK FORCE, NEITHER ACCEPTED NOR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE MADE ANY EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT ITS SERVICES WILL GUARANTEE CLIENT ADMISSION TO ANY ACADEMIC INSTITUTION OR CONTRACT WITH ANY OTHER DESIRED ENTITY, FIRM OR ORGANIZATION, OR ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL OUTCOME.

FOR THE PURPOSES OF THESE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS, USE OF THE ACCEPTED WEBSITE INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY SERVICES THAT ACCEPTED MAY PROVIDE TO CLIENT AS A RESULT OF CLIENT’S USE OF THE SAID WEBSITE.

### VII. TERMINATION

If the problem is not addressed or cured to the reasonable satisfaction of both parties, either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party. Pursuant to this provision only and notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, at Accepted’s reasonable discretion, Client may receive a partial refund.

Accepted will be entitled to immediately terminate this Agreement on written notice to the Client for any egregious behavior, misconduct or breach by the Client relating to this Agreement, such termination to be at Accepted’s sole discretion.

Paragraph headings contained hereunder are solely for the purpose of aiding in speedy location of subject matter and are not in any sense to be given weight in the construction of this Agreement. Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the construction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though paragraph headings had been omitted. Each of the parties has participated in the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and therefore waives any rule of law or judicial precedent that provides that contractual ambiguities are to be construed against the party who shall have drafted the contract in question. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between Accepted and Client and cannot be altered or modified except by an agreement in writing signed by both Accepted and Client. Upon its execution, this Agreement shall supersede all prior negotiations, understandings, and agreements, whether oral or written, and such prior agreements shall thereupon be null and void and without further legal effect.

Accepted and Client acknowledge that the Services are inherently of a personal nature and that a key element of the Services is that Client’s reputation as a candidate be preserved and that Accepted’s reputation be preserved. Accepted agrees that it will not disparage or make negative comments with respect to Client or Client’s credentials to any admissions counselor or professional at any academic institution. Client agrees that s/he will not disparage, or make negative comments with respect to, Accepted or its business, the Services or any of its counselors, officers, employees, contractors or other representatives, including without limitation posting (anonymously or otherwise) online or in the media any negative comments or reviews.

Accepted charges a minimum incremental fee, based on a five-minute time period for any client request. Therefore, any client interaction will be billed at this minimum rate. Any time required for a specific task that exceeds five minutes will be billed to the minute.
