* **Legitimate interest** — Our legitimate interests are our commercial company interests (e.g. to improve our products and services), our interest to prevent fraud, and our interest to report possible criminal acts or threats to competent authorities. We rely on this reason only when reasonable, and when balanced against your human rights and freedoms.
    
* **Consent** — When you have given us explicit consent to process your personal data for a specific purpose.
