If you use Sketch Platform on behalf of, or in collaboration with, a Company that is a Sketch customer (e.g., your employer, a reseller, an agent, a sales representative or other), that company may provide us with information about you so that we can provision your account.

### Legal basis for processing

When we process personal data, we rely on the following legal bases:

* **Legal obligation** — There may be cases when we have a legal responsibility to process your personal data in order to comply with our legal obligations.
    
* **Legitimate interest** — Our legitimate interests are our commercial company interests (e.g. to improve our products and services), our interest to prevent fraud, and our interest to report possible criminal acts or threats to competent authorities. We rely on this reason only when reasonable, and when balanced against your human rights and freedoms.
    
* **Consent** — When you have given us explicit consent to process your personal data for a specific purpose.
