### License and intellectual property rights

1. You shall remain the owner of the Content. You grant Sketch B.V. a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license with a right to sub-license to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform the Content to the extent required for the provision of the Sketch Platform.
    
2. The license granted under clause 3.1 does not entitle Sketch B.V. to use the Content for marketing purposes. However, You grant Sketch B.V. a limited and non-exclusive license, revocable by You at any time by giving 14 days’ prior notice, to use Your business logo on Sketch B.V.’s marketing website for the purpose of presenting sample customers of the Sketch Platform in a neutral way. Sketch B.V. is allowed to use Your logo for this purpose only and the license granted herein is not transferable nor sublicensable. Sketch B.V. may also include a quote drafted by You relating to the service hereunder to be published in press releases. Such quote must be agreed on beforehand by You and Sketch B.V..
    
3. The license granted under clause 3.1 remains effective until such Agreement is suspended or terminated in accordance with clause 14.
    
4. Sketch B.V. grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited, revocable right to access and use the Sketch Platform in accordance with the Agreement, subject to Your payment of applicable fees under this Agreement. Sketch B.V. reserves all rights not expressly granted to You.

7. You understand and agree that Sketch B.V. may be independently creating content, other products and services that may be similar to or competitive with the Content. Nothing in the Agreement will be construed as restricting or preventing Sketch B.V. from creating and fully exploiting any such content, other products and services without any obligations to You.
    

### Sketch Platform subscription

1. If You register directly on Sketch B.V.’s website, You can start a trial of the Sketch Platform and create a Workspace in the Web app via [www.sketch.com](https://www.sketch.com/home). Once You have created a Workspace, You are the Admin for that Workspace. In case of a Business plan, you may be assigned a Sketch customer success manager (depending on the number of Editor’s seats purchased) who will assist You with the onboarding process and will further support You with priority support in accordance with clause 8.6 of these Terms.
    
2. After confirming Your agreement with our Terms of Service, You can trial the Sketch Platform for a one-time, limited term of 30 (thirty) consecutive days for the sole purpose of testing and evaluating Sketch. Upon expiration of the trial, You will be prompted for payment information in order to convert Your trial into a paid subscription, and You will need to reconfirm acceptance of our Terms of Service. Sketch B.V. will charge Your designated payment method for the coming period so that You can keep using the Sketch Platform. In case You don’t convert your trial into a paid subscription, You acknowledge and agree that Sketch B.V. may delete all of your content or data associated with the Workspace that was assigned to Your trial, provided that You will be granted 90 (ninety) days from the end of the trial to recover the files. Also, Sketch B.V. reserves the right to modify the terms of service of any trial and/or cancel any trial subscription at any time. If You are purchasing the Sketch Platform via or thanks to a third-party Partner, the free trial referenced in this clause 4.2 and in the preceding clause 4.1 won’t apply to Your purchase.
    
3. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for our services be subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax. The fees displayed on Sketch B.V.’s pricing page are applicable for direct purchases made on sketch.com and may vary on third-party merchant platforms. You acknowledge and agree that any and all bank fees associated with the payment of fees under this Agreement shall be Your sole responsibility. Sketch B.V. shall not be liable for any costs, charges, or expenses incurred by You in connection with banking transactions, including but not limited to wire transfer fees, currency conversion fees, or any other similar charges
    
4. If You are the Admin for a Workspace, You can: (a) invite individuals for Your Workspace and assign them the role of Admin, Editor, Viewer, Guest or the Finance Role via www.sketch.com, (b) assign yourself the role of Editor or Viewer, (c) You can revoke the assigned role of Editor or Viewer with immediate effect and (d) You can request and manage the Restricted Upload feature. If You are the Workspace Owner You can, inter alia: (a) request the deletion of a Workspace; (b) request a change of Plan; (c) transfer document between Workspaces; (d) issue data deletion requests; (e) request and manage the Restricted Upload feature; and (f) access My Drafts in case a user is removed from a Workspace.
    
5. If You are an Editor in a Workspace, You are granted a license to Use the Mac app for the term that You are an Editor. Each Editor in a Workspace can use their own Sketch Account to log into the Sketch Platform on any device they own; however, sharing credentials to access and use the Sketch Platform is a violation of this Agreement, including its clause 10.2, and may result in Sketch B.V. suspending Your Sketch Account and terminating this Agreement.
    
6. If You are a Viewer or a Guest in a Workspace, You can review Content and post Comments, but You cannot access the Mac app or upload Content to the Web app.
    
7. Promotions that may be run by Sketch B.V., whether via email, on websites, social media platforms or otherwise, are subject to these Terms and to any other specific rule that might include duration, entry instructions and specific details, rules or conditions relating to a particular Promotion.
    
8. Our subscriptions refund policy depends on the billing option You chose during the sign- up process:
    
    * For monthly billing, we don’t offer refunds, but You can cancel at any time, You won’t be billed again and You can use Your account until it expires;
    * For annual billing, we offer a full refund within 30 days of Your initial purchase. Subsequent purchases, such as additional seats and renewals, are not refundable. To request a refund on an annual billing charge, You can contact our [Customer Support](https://www.sketch.com/support/contact/) following the instructions detailed in our [Refund Policy](https://www.sketch.com/support/billing-and-plans/billing/refunds/).
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, if You fail to prove your identity as the Workspace Owner within 30 days of Your purchase, the refund request may be rejected at Sketch’s sole discretion.
    
9. If You are given access to Beta Features, You are not obligated to use them and Sketch B.V. may immediately and without notice remove Your access to such Beta Features for any reason without liability to You. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, all Beta Features are provided “AS IS” without warranties of any kind and without any performance obligations.

### Content

Sketch B.V. does not endorse the Content or any advice, suggestion or opinion expressed in the Content. Content is not Personal Data (as this term is defined in the DPA); to this extent, Sketch B.V. waives any liability in connection with the information that You may upload in the Content (such as pictures, identity documents or other) that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, and You shall indemnify Sketch B.V. pursuant to clause 13 of these Terms in case of breach and/or claim by a third party.
    
2. You warrant that You have (and will continue to have during Your use of the Sketch Platform) all necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions which are required to enable Sketch B.V. to use the Content for the purposes of the provision of the Sketch Platform, and otherwise to use the Content in the manner contemplated by the Sketch Platform and these Terms.
    
3. When embedding a font in the Content, You warrant that You have all necessary licenses, rights and permissions to use such font in the Content and to redistribute it and You agree to comply with all the applicable font’s license terms and conditions. In case of breach of this Clause 5.3, You will indemnify and hold Sketch B.V. harmless in accordance with Clause 13 of this Agreement.
    
4. On becoming aware of any (potential) violation of the Agreement, Sketch B.V. reserves the right (a) to remove the Content which is in violation of the Agreement and (b) to disable access to such Content at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.
    
5. Without prejudice to the foregoing, in case You select to activate the Restricted Upload feature, you acknowledge that Sketch B.V. won’t have access anymore to the Content whose upload in the Workspace has been restricted.
    

### Comments

1. Sketch B.V. is not responsible and liable for Comments posted by You or third parties, including Comments with respect to the Content. Sketch B.V. does not endorse the Comments or any advice, suggestion or opinion expressed in the Comments.
    
2. You shall not post Comments that:

    3. are otherwise in violation of the law and/or of the Agreement.

### Feedback and notifications

1. You acknowledge and agree that if You provide Sketch B.V. with any suggestions, comments, or other feedback about the Sketch Platform (jointly **“Feedback”**), such Feedback is given voluntarily. Even if You designate such Feedback as confidential, the Feedback will not be confidential unless expressly otherwise agreed in writing by Sketch B.V., and Sketch B.V. will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license, or otherwise distribute or exploit the Feedback at its sole discretion without any obligations or restrictions of any kind, including without limitation, intellectual property rights or licensing obligations.
    
2. Sketch B.V. does not monitor the Content uploaded and shared using the Sketch Platform. If You believe or become aware that (a) Your copyright-protected work is made available through the Sketch Platform without authorization, or (b) other clearly unlawful Content is made available through the Sketch Platform, You may notify Sketch B.V. by email at **[legal@sketch.com](mailto:legal@sketch.com)**. Upon receipt of a notification, Sketch B.V. will decide at its sole discretion whether it will remove the relevant Content, taking into account the evidence provided in the notification. You acknowledge that misuse of this process may result in the suspension of Your account or other legal consequences.
    
3. Notifications to Sketch are usually made at the address referenced to in clause 7.2 but when the Sketch Account provides for a different notification tool (such as a subscribe/unsubscribe button), its use shall be considered as a valid notification.
