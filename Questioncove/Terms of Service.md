-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Be Respectful, thankful, and helpful!

Show respect for people on the site, don't be rude. Make sure to help others learn and understand instead of just giving a direct answer. Users of QuestionCove provide help on their own time and with their own passion to teach and assist people in learning. Thank them for their efforts!

### Behavior

* Be nice to all users. You don't know what they could be going through.
* Don't bully or harass anyone.
* Do not impersonate users by any means
* Don't offend other users based on their race, sex, or religion.
* Do not spam the site. There will be a zero tolerance against spammers.
* Do not curse or try to bypass the language filter by using acronyms or alternative symbols.
* Do not try to increase your Level by participating in medal spammings.
* Do not try to gain personal info from users on this site, which includes age, phone number, email address, address, and/or school name.

### When Asking a Question:

* Questions containing content from Tests, Quizzes, or Exams is a violation of our Anti-Cheating Policy. (Please refer to our Anti-Cheating Policy which can be found here: [Terms And Conditions](https://questioncove.com/terms-and-conditions))
* Only post questions in their respective subjects.

* Do not post clickbaits to get users to view your questions. Ex: Will give medal, fan, etc
* Be respectful to the user who is helping you.
* Cooperate with the helper, don't expect an answer.
* If you don't understand their way of teaching, kindly ask if they can explain it a different way.
* Keep in mind that helpers do not get paid to help, so remember to thank the helper for assisting you.
* Do not mass tag users when trying to get help.

### When Answering a Question:

* Always be sure to guide users to their answer rather than just giving it directly. We have zero tolerance for direct answers.
* Be patient with the user. If they don't understand something, try to explain it differently or let someone else try to answer it another way.
* Do not intentionally give wrong answers. If you don't know how to help the user, then try to contact other users who might be able to help

### Site Moderation:

* Respect the Moderator's decision. If you attempt to evade a Moderator's actions, you will receive an extended punishment for evasion/attempt to evade.
* Moderators can take action at their sole discretion for any reason or no reason at all.
* If you feel that you were incorrectly judged and penalized, please send us an email at abuse@questioncove.com to discuss it with a QuestionCove staff member.
