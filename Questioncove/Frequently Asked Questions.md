[The Rules](https://questioncove.com/rules)

  
  
  
  
[Asking Questions](#asking_questions)  
  
[**How do I ask a question?**](#how_do_i_ask_questions)

At the top left of the page, there is a box that indicates "Ask a question"

  
  
[**What are the guidelines for asking questions?**](#asking_guidelines)

Please try to keep your question education-focused. If you would like to have a casual conversation please use the chat boxes at the bottom instead. Also, please refrain from asking questions from graded quizzes or tests as this is a violation of our [Anti-Cheating policy](https://questioncove.com/rules).

  
  
[**I posted a question but nobody has responded. What can I do?**](#nobody_responded)

Your first step should be to make sure your question has everything necessary for someone to be able to answer your question. For example, any relevant images, graphs, or data. The next step would be to post a link to your question in the chat (never post the question itself). If there is still no reply, tag users by posting @username on the question. Even if they may not be able to answer the question itself, they may know someone who can!

  
  
[**What subject should I post my question in?**](#what_subject)

Please try to find the most appropriate subject for your question. If you are in doubt please tag a moderator, explain the content of your question, and we will suggest a subject for you to post in.

  
  
[**I accidentally posted my question in the wrong subject!**](#wrong_subject)

No worries, you may tag a moderator and we will move it upon request. You may also close your question and repost it in the appropriate subject.

  
  
[**I can't post a question**](#cant_post_question)

Most likely you already have a question open in that subject. You can have one question open per subject at one time, so if you already have an open question it must be closed before posting a new one. If you are having trouble finding it, try switching to the subject the question is posted in, it should then appear in the "Ask a Question" box. If you are still having trouble's you can contact a moderator and we will assist.

  
  
  
  
[Answering Questions](#answering_questions)  
  
[**What are the guidelines for answering questions?**](#answering_guidelines)

When answering a question, please try to stay on topic. Avoid giving the answer outright; please provide an explanation and help guide the user through explanations instead. Please avoid copy-pasting answers from other websites as this is plagiarism and reflects poorly on the site as a whole.

  
  
[**Is there a specific format I need to follow?**](#answering_format)

Besides the general rule of not giving direct answers, you may format your answer however you wish. For questions involving formulas or calculations, you may want to use LaTeX to make your work easier to read. In general, try to make your work logical and easy to follow.

  
  
[**What if I don't know how to answer a question?**](#dont_know_answer)

Please try to avoid giving misleading information. If you are unsure of how to answer a question, you may simply tell the asker you are unsure of how to solve the question. You may try tagging another user if they are willing and able to help.

  
  
  
  
  
  
[SmartScores](#smartscores)  
  
[**What is a SmartScore?**](#what_is_smartscore)

A SmartScore is a number assigned to each user. It is meant to represent your activity and contributions towards the site. Each user starts off as level 0 and can reach a maximum of 100.

  
  
[**Is it possible to reach 100 SmartScore?**](#100_smartscore)

Yes, however only one person can be 100 at a time, so you would have to pass them in points in order to become 100.

  
  
[**Why is there only one level 100 user?**](#why_only_1_100)

The person with the highest overall SmartScore points is assigned 100SS.

  
  
[**How do I increase my SmartScore?**](#increase_smartscore)

By doing just about anything on the site. Most things will lead to your SmartScore going up, however depending on how productive it is usually measures how much you receive. Note: Certain behaviors such as medal-spamming, spamming the chat, and posting spam questions, are not acceptable ways to increase your SmartScore. If you engage in these behaviors you are subject to being suspended and your SmartScore will be lowered accordingly.

  
  
[**Why do users sometimes appear out of order?**](#out_of_order_userlist)

Sometimes lower-SS users may appear above higher-SS users. There are a few reasons for this: for one, it may be a glitch. It usually happens when the server and client fall out of sync, so the server sends a user at a position that from the clients perspective is incorrect. However, it can also be because some users have had SmartScore points transferred from OpenStudy.
