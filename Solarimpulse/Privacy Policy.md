If you choose to view and use third-party contents on the Website, third-party cookies, such

as those of social media platform, may be placed on your device. The Solar Impulse

Foundation has no influence on the data processing by such third parties. Those third parties

have their own privacy and cookies policies.



Further, the Website uses services from Google Analytics, Hotjar, HubSpot, Facebook Pixel

and Linkedin Insight Tag, as described below. If you do not wish to participate in tracking in

connection with these services, you can object by disabling the storage of cookies through

your browser settings or by enabling the opt-out option.



a. Google Analytics



We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600

Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Analytics uses cookies to

analyze the behavior of website visitors. It provides us with information about the number of

visits, length of visits, and contents viewed, allowing us to continuously improve the Website.

Further information and Google's data protection provisions can be found under Google

Privacy and Google Terms.



b. Hotjar



We use Hotjar, a service provided by Hotjar Ltd, Dragonara Business Centre 5th Floor,

Dragonara Road, Paceville St. Julian's STJ 3141, Malta. It helps us better understand user

experiences (time spent on a website, clicked links, preferences, dislikes, etc.), allowing us

to target based on user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies to collect information about user

behavior and the devices they use. This information is pseudonymized in user profiles and

stored by Hotjar.



c. HubSpot



We use HubSpot, a service provided by HubSpot, Inc., headquartered at 25 First Street,

Cambridge, MA 02141, USA. It is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform that

allows us to better understand and optimize our interactions with members and partners.

Through HubSpot, we can track and analyze user behaviors, such as their interaction with

the Website, content preferences, and more. HubSpot uses cookies to collect this data,

which is then pseudonymously stored in user profiles.



d. Facebook Pixel



We use a "Facebook pixel" from the social network Facebook, Meta Platforms, Inc., One

Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, to track user behavior when they click on an

advertisement on Facebook. With the Facebook pixel, we can understand how our

promotional measures are received on Meta (formerly Facebook) and take improvement

actions as needed. The tracking duration for users accessing the Solar Impulse Foundation

website by clicking on the advertisements we publish on Facebook can last up to 180 days.

If you wish to disable cookies for Meta, you must adjust your browser settings. More

information on this can be found in your browser's help menu. The data is collected

anonymously and does not allow identification of the user. Meta records and processes the

data for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Meta Platforms Ireland Limited's

data processing directive (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/).



e. LinkedIn Insight Tag



We use the "LinkedIn Insight Tag" from the social network LinkedIn, operated by LinkedIn

Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland. This tool creates a cookie in

your web browser that records metadata such as IP address, timestamp, and page-related

events (e.g., pages viewed). IP addresses are shortened or hashed (pseudonymized) if they

are used to reach LinkedIn members on all devices. Direct LinkedIn member identifiers are

deleted by LinkedIn after seven days. Other pseudonymized data is deleted within 180 days.

LinkedIn does not share personal data with the website owner but only provides reports and

communications (in which LinkedIn members are not identified) on website audience and

display performance. LinkedIn also offers retargeting of website visitors on LinkedIn,

allowing us to use this data to display targeted ads outside of the Website. You can find

more information on data protection at LinkedIn in their privacy policy.
