### I. Information We Collect

We collect information directly from you when you provide it to us.

If you register an account, create a profile, purchase Services, register products, or otherwise engage with us, you may provide personal information such as name, home address, email address, phone number, payment information (credit card information, bank account information, PIN), username, date of birth, and other similar identifiers. We also may collect information relating to the business you represent and demographic information such as domain information, zip codes, trade group association, and areas of interest. We may collect any other information you choose to provide.

We may receive the aforementioned personal information from third-party sources such as payment processors, product registration services, other service providers, and social media sites with which you interact to obtain or inquire about Services.

We also collect personal information about you when you use or interact with the Services:

* **Access and Usage Information:** We collect information about how you access our Services, including data about the device and network you use, such as your hardware model, operating system version, mobile network, IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, and app version. We also collect information about your activity on our Sites and Devices, including device information, access times, pages viewed, links clicked, referral channel, items added to shopping cart, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
* **Precise Geolocation:** If you use certain of our connected Devices, we may collect your geolocation data, including information that permits us to determine your location, such as if you provide location information or enable your mobile device to send us location information when using the Services. You may stop the collection of precise location information at any time, but please note that the functionality or availability of the Services may be affected should you choose to do so (see the [Your Privacy Rights and Choices](#your-privacy-rights-and-choices) section below for details).
* **Transactional Information:** When you make, exchange, or return a purchase, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction.
* **Audio Recordings, Photos, and Chat Content:** If you contact customer service through our chat feature or by phone, we may monitor and retain those conversations, including for training purposes.
* **Usage Information Collected By Devices:** If you use our Devices, we may collect telemetry data associated with use of the Device. We may collect GPS location data to pair your Device with the associated mobile app or other Services. When you have a Device connected to our Services, we will collect various Device event data, such as information required to provide the Services to you, when the Device is used, whether the Device is turned on or off, whether certain features on the mobile app or Device are used and how, and aggregate Device activity information.
* **Your Content:** With your permission, we may collect information and content stored on your mobile device, such as your contact list for use with our Services.
* **Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Technologies:** We use cookies, pixels, web beacons, device identifiers, and other similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with the Services. These technologies help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. For more information about the cookies and other tracking technologies we use, and the choices available to you, see the [Your Privacy Rights and Choices](#your-privacy-rights-and-choices) section below.

We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your approximate location based on your IP address or infer that you are looking to purchase certain products based on your browsing behavior and past purchases.

### II. Why We Collect Your Information

We process your personal information for various purposes, including to:

* Provide, maintain, and improve our products, Devices, and services;
* Develop new products and services;
* Process transactions and send you related information, including confirmations, receipts, invoices, customer experience surveys, product information and recall notices;
* Better understand your interests in order to personalize and improve your experience with our Services;
* Send you technical notices, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
* Respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service;
* Provide support and services to you, including related to our limited and lifetime warranties (as applicable);
* Communicate with you about products, services, and events offered by us and our affiliates and provide news and information that we think will interest you;
* Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services;
* Personalize the advertisements you see on third-party platforms and websites (for more information, see the [Targeted Advertising and Analytics](#targeted-advertising-and-analytics) section below);
* Create customer profiles to personalize and enhance your experience across our affiliated brands;

### III. Targeted Advertising and Analytics

We engage others to provide analytics services, serve advertisements, and perform related marketing and analytics services across the web and in mobile applications. These entities may use cookies, pixels, web beacons, SDKs, device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and mobile apps, including your IP address, web browser and mobile network information, device fingerprint, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in mobile apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information is used to deliver advertising targeted to your interests on other companies’ sites or mobile apps and to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your activity. In addition, we may share identifiers, like email addresses and phone numbers, with some of our advertising partners. These advertising partners translate that information into a unique identifier that can then be used to show ads that are more relevant to you across the web and in mobile apps. Some of the activities described in this section may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sharing,” or “selling” under certain laws. To learn more about the choices available to you with respect to these practices, see the [Your Privacy Rights and Choices](#your-privacy-rights-and-choices) section below.

You can also learn more about interest-based ads or opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance, by visiting www.aboutads.info/choices, or, if you reside in the European Union, by visiting www.youronlinechoices.eu. Your device may also include a feature that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through mobile apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.

### IV. Disclosure of Information

We may disclose your personal information in the following situations:

* With vendors, service providers, and consultants that perform services for us, such as companies that assist us with web hosting, site analytics, shipping and delivery, payment processing, bill collection, fraud prevention, customer service, product development and maintenance, research, customer reviews, and marketing and advertising.
* If you submit a product review or post content in another public area of our Services, we disclose this information publicly on our Services.
* If you choose to use or implement third party integrations we facilitate on our Services or with other third parties, such as a smart home platform, voice assistant, map service or a weather provider, we may disclose certain information to the entity and/or device integrated with our Services. If you choose to use or implement integrations we offer on our Services or with our Devices or to logon to our Services using credentials from a third-party platform, such as a smart home platform, voice assistant, map service or a weather provider, we may receive certain information from the third party and/or Device integrated with our Services. When such third parties allow for deletion of data collected from their platform, you may request us to delete personal information we collected from such third party by contacting us. Personal information collected by such third parties or third-party platforms are governed by the applicable third party’s privacy policy.
* If you choose to participate in a program we have with third parties, such as insurance companies, non-profit environmental organizations, or installation or repair service providers, we may disclose information about you, including certain information captured by your Device(s), to the third party with your consent.
* We may disclose personal information if we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
* We may disclose personal information if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, if we believe that you have violated the law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, the public, or others.
* We disclose personal information to our lawyers and other professional advisers where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and manage our business interests.
* We may disclose personal information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
* Between and among our current and future parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership.
* With your consent or at your direction.

We also disclose aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used by the recipients to identify you.

### V. Retention of Information

We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it, or for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, contractual, and warranty (to you and to third parties), or other compliance obligations. For example, we may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with the law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot service, enforce our agreements, facilitate your ability to reactivate your account or take other actions permitted by law. Likewise, if your account is terminated or suspended by us, we may maintain some information to prevent re-registration.

#### Opting Out of Targeted Advertising, Sharing, and Sales

As described in the [Targeted Advertising and Analytics](#targeted-advertising-and-analytics) section above, we process personal information to understand and improve your experience with our Services and to serve you advertisements on third party properties. Some of these activities may be considered “sales” or “sharing” of your personal information or “targeted advertising” under certain privacy laws.

Depending on where you reside, you may have the right to opt out of targeted advertising, sharing, and sales of your personal information. You can do so by following the prompts when first visiting our Sites, by [clicking here](https://www.moen.com/privacy-settings), or by visiting our Sites with a legally-recognized opt-out preference signal enabled (such as the Global Privacy Control).

You can also adjust certain cookie settings by selecting the appropriate option on the banner that appears when first visiting our website or by accessing the “Privacy Settings” link at the bottom of our website at any time and selecting the appropriate options.

With your consent, certain of our products and services with mobile applications may access information on your mobile device such as your camera or contact list. You can always withdraw such access by not allowing our products to access features on your device for a specific task or, if for multiple tasks, going into your device settings and removing the application’s access to that information. Please note that if you deny or revoke this access, it could affect the availability and functionality of the product or Service and of certain features of the mobile application.

### VII. Transfer of Information to the United States and Other Countries

We are headquartered in the United States and we have operations and vendors in the United States and other countries. Therefore, we and those that perform work for us may transfer your personal information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide levels of data protection that are equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction. Where required by law, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal data in accordance with applicable law, such as by obtaining your consent, relying on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions, or executing Standard Contractual Clauses. Where relevant, you may request a copy of these Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us at [customerservice@mlock.com](mailto:customerservice@mlock.com).
