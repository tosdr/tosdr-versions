SCOPE

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us in our business, including on our websites, mobile applications, and other online or offline offerings (collectively, the “**Services**”).

This Privacy Policy applies to all of our operating divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates, and branches and any additional subsidiary, affiliate, or branch that we may subsequently form.

I.               PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
================================================

The categories of personal information we collect depend on whether you are a user or visitor, and the requirements of applicable law.

Information You Provide to Us.
------------------------------

**Your Communications with Us**.  We collect personal information from you such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, request customer or technical support, apply for a job or otherwise communicate with us.

**Surveys**.  We may contact you to participate in surveys.  If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include personal information.

**Social Media Content**.  We may offer social media pages. Any content you provide on these channels will be considered “public” and is not subject to privacy protections.

**Account Creation with Third-Party Partners**:  While you don’t need to create a user account with Big Run Studios to use our Services, including playing our mobile games, please note you may need to create a user account with our third-party partners for use of certain in-app features. When you create such an account, our third-party partners may collect certain personal information about you such as your name, email address, and payment information. Please refer to our third-party partners’ Privacy Policy for more information on the use and collection of the personal information you provide them. 

Information Collected Automatically or From Others
--------------------------------------------------

**Automatic Data Collection**.  We may collect certain information automatically when you use the Services.  This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details about your browser, operating system or device, location information, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before, during and after using the Services, information about the links you click, and other information about how you use the Services.  Information we collect may be associated with accounts and other devices as appropriate based on the functionality of the Services.

In addition, we may automatically collect information related to your use of our Services, including gameplay data such as the number of games you play per day, the types of content you interact with, and the frequency and duration of your activities.

**Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics Information, and Interest-Based Advertising technologies**.  We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“**Technologies**”) to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us and our partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.

The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.

**Analytics**.  We may also use Google Analytics and other service providers to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on our Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.  You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

=============================================================

Except as provided below, we do not share, disclose, or sell your personal information.

**Service Providers**.  We may share any personal information we collect about you with our third-party service providers.  The categories of service providers (processors) to whom we entrust personal information include: IT and related services; information and services; payment processors; customer service providers; and vendors to support the provision of the Services.

This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising”.  We may allow access to other data collected by the Services to share information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.  If you prefer not to share your personal information with third party advertising partners, you may follow the instructions below in Section IV “Your Choices”.

**Disclosures to Protect Us or Others**.  We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our or others’ rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.

**International Data Transfers**.  You agree that all information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected and require our third-party service providers and partners to have appropriate safeguards as well. Further details can be provided upon request.

IV.            YOUR CHOICES.
============================

General.

You have certain choices about your personal information.  Where you have consented to the processing of your personal information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and prevent further processing by contacting us as described below.  Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use non- personal information regarding your activities on our Services and for other legal purposes as described above.

Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device.  Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites.  These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
