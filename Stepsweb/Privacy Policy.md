2\. Consent to collect children’s information
---------------------------------------------

Student accounts are typically created by teachers, school administrators or parents. By creating student accounts on StepsWeb, teachers/parents provide consent and authorisation for StepsWeb to store and process personal data about those children.

3\. Access and Correction of Personal Information
-------------------------------------------------

**StepsWeb Educator Personal Information**

Educators may request access to and correction of their own personal information.  Please make any request via email, using the same address that you use for your StepsWeb account.  Requests can be made to [info@stepsweb.com](mailto:info@stepsweb.com).

**StepsWeb Student Personal Information**

Student data may be requested by Educators on the same account.  It may also be requested by associated professions, such as specialist teachers supporting that account.  However, in those cases, we require verification from the account owner that this person has the account owner’s permission to access the student’s data.

If, as an Educator, you want to make a request for information from us, please make the request via email, using the same address that you use for your StepsWeb account.

Students themselves, or guardians of those students, must request information from an Educator on that account.   They can only request information directly from us with verified permission from an account Educator.   This information is limited to their own personal information and does not include information about any other student on the account.

**Non-StepsWeb Personal Information**

Upon verifying your identity, you may request access and correction of your personal information via email to [info@stepsweb.com](mailto:info@stepsweb.com).

4\. Sharing information with third parties
------------------------------------------

We do not sell student or user personal information, and do not release personal information collected or received to any unrelated third parties for promotional purposes.  We may, however, share aggregated product usage data with unrelated third parties, and share personal information only as described below:

**Service Providers**

We may share your information with our service providers—that is, organizations providing services to support StepsWeb functions, such as our hosting services provider, mail and email processing providers, payment processing providers, and research and support providers. All such service providers are bound by contract to refrain from using the personal information we collect from you for any purpose other than providing the specified services to StepsWeb.

For site and login analytics, Google Analytics is used, excluding the app post-login to safeguard student privacy. Additionally, Datadog supports our system's reliability and performance, without involving personal data, maintaining a secure and efficient service for all users.
