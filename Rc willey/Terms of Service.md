* **Arbitration Procedure**. If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), as applicable; except AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims. If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions, the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions shall govern. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms and Conditions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, provincial, territorial, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
* **Hearing Format**. Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitration shall take place in Travis County, Texas, but may proceed telephonically in the event the total amount of the claim does not exceed $2,500 U.S. dollars (if the claimant so chooses). In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, in any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by RC Willey, or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or RC Willey is entitled. The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.
* **Arbitration Fees**. RC Willey will pay, or (if applicable) reimburse you, for all AAA (as applicable) filing, administration, and arbitration fees for any arbitration commenced by you or RC Willey pursuant to these Terms of Use. You are responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses.
* **Opt-Out**. You may elect to opt-out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in these Terms and Conditions by sending a written letter to RC Willey at 2301 South 300 West Salt Lake City, UT 84115 within thirty (30) calendar days of your initial agreement to these Terms and Conditions (including your first use of the Services) that specifies: (1) your name; (2) your mailing address; (3) and your request to be excluded from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this Section. In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedures set forth above, all other terms of these Terms and Conditions shall continue to apply.
* **Amendments to this Section**. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, you and RC Willey agree that if RC Willey makes any material amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in these Terms and Conditions, RC Willey will notify you and you will have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments by sending a written letter to the RC Willey Notice Address that specifies: (1) your name; (2) your mailing address; and (3) your request to opt-out of such amendments. If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these Terms and Conditions, without any of the proposed amendments governing. If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.
* **Severability**. If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms and Conditions remaining in full force and effect.
