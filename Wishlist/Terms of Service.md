3.       SUBSCRIPTIONS & AUTOMATIC RENEWALS.

WishList Premium Services come with a yearly subscription that renews automatically every year. This applies to all paid services.

The subscription will automatically renew on the next term, but if you want to, you can disable the automatic renewal at any time after the purchase right from the Account Settings page, so you will not be charged next year.

Please, note the following details regarding WishList Subscriptions:

* Subscription renewals are automatically processed annually on the same date of your first purchase. The subscription renewal will continue and remain valid for each one (1) year unless the subscription is canceled before the renewal date.
* You may cancel your subscription at any time from your Account page on the WishList website. If you choose to cancel your subscription, starting from the moment your subscription expires you will no longer have access to WishLists Premium Service.

We cannot grant refunds on renewal payments. We will send you an email 1 month prior to the renewal date, and you may use this opportunity to cancel your subscription before the renewal payment is automatically processed.

If you choose to cancel your subscription, your subscription will expire exactly on the same day and month of the original purchase, and you will no longer have access to WishLists Premium Service.

You may not provide direct, or indirect access to our content or downloads, resell, share, or publish WishList subscription credentials or access. Do not infringe any intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright, trademark, patent, or other proprietary rights).

We reserve the right to refuse service or cancel your subscription and revoke access to WishList Premium Service for any reason we deem appropriate.

4\. PAYMENTS

All payments are handled using PayPal or Stripe.

5\. PRICE CHANGES

WishList will provide notice to the customer of any changes, detailing the specific rationale for the change, at least one (1) month prior to the change taking effect. The customer then has the right to end the subscription without any penalties or prejudice to other commitments made by the customer.

Should a month pass without any response from the customer, it will be assumed that the customer has accepted the new terms.
