**1\. SCOPE OF APPLICATION AND RESPONSIBILITY**

The Company is the data controller of the personal data (e.g. information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or e-mail address) we collect from and about you through our services. The personal data is processed in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy and our [Cookies Policy](https://arkeero.com/cookies-policy) apply to all users, including those who use the Company services without being registered or subscribed to a Company service and those who have registered or subscribed to a Company service.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy is not applicable to data collected by third parties though their websites, even if any of said websites contains links to the Company’s Website.

The Company is not responsible for any content within the privacy policy of third parties and does not give any warranty, explicit or implicit, in relation to the accuracy, legality, exactitude or validity of any website.

**2\. COMPANY SERVICES**

The Website offers you the possibility to manage your user area, configure alerts, receive newsletters, information and advertising about the Company’s and/or third parties’ products and services. The newsletters, information and advertising previously mentioned shall be based on the areas of interest that you may have indicated to us according to criteria of the Website, as well as on your profile. If you wish, you may also join and participate in different promotions, contests and/or raffles.

To use the Company services, you shall register on the Website through the enabled registration form and give your freely and express consent to the processing of your data, as well as to this Privacy Policy and our [Cookies Policy](https://arkeero.com/cookies-policy).

In this regard, you may select through certain check boxes at least three (3) fields of interest among the options provided by the Website. Furthermore, you may choose whether you accept the transfer of your anonymized data – to be anonymized through encryption and an electronic pseudonym – so that we can match it with other information and enrich the data. This procedure shall be carried out though technical means in a totally anonymous and not identifiable manner.

The data transfer aims to match the information with other sources and therefore increase the information on the centres of interest – which may have been defined directly, through browsing or other subscriptions – and refine the advertising campaigns. This is without prejudice to your privacy, which is warranted through the encryption and compartmentation of your data.

**3\. TYPE OF DATA COLLECTED BY THE COMPANY**

The Company collects information to offer you services either directly, through the personal data provided directly to the Company, or indirectly through the use of the Website and the services provided by it (information related to the device, registration data and physical location).

In particular, the Company collects the following types of data from and about you:

**a.** Registration Data submitted to register for a Company service through subscription forms. Subscription forms request personal data through mandatory or optional fields to be filled in by you, such as your name, your telephone number and your e-mail address in order to manage the mailing list and send you personalized online advertising. The subscription to the mailing list is carried out through the Hermes and Perseo tools. The sending of e-mails is managed by the Company, which previously verifies your e-mail. For this purpose, you will receive an e-mail in your inbox from us with the subject “Successfully registered in our newsletter of exclusive offers” or similar. We will use the data provided to send you advertising of our clients. Registration Information may include, for example, name, surname, e-mail address, gender, country, postcode and birthday date, areas of interest, and academic/professional aspects. Please bear in mind that you are entitled to revoke your consent or inform us that you have not subscribed to any our services by the channels set forth in Section 14 of this Privacy Policy.

We are not responsible for the security or privacy of the information collected by these third parties. You should read and understand the policies applicable to the third-parties’ services you use or access before giving your consent to said third-parties.

For more information, please visit our [Cookies Policy](https://arkeero.com/cookies-policy).

**e.** Information from other Sources. We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services and commercially available sources.

Your personal data will be retained for two (2) years from the date on which you provided it to the Company. The Company shall use the data to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. However, the time of retention of your data will be always subject to your voluntary withdrawal to the mailing list or subscription to the blog, unless the Company needs it in case of compelling legitimate grounds, which override your interests, or for legal defence.
