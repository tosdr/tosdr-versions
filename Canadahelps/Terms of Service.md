CanadaHelps uses all reasonable and best efforts to honour all donors’ wishes and instructions in disbursing their donation to the charity or charities of their choice.

CanadaHelps transfers the donated amount (minus its payment processing fee described below) to the registered charity(ies) selected by the donor (unless the donation is intended by you to be to CanadaHelps alone, in which case and the gift is retained by CanadaHelps in its entirety). In some cases, you may be able to direct your donation to a group of charities (“Cause Funds”), which may be grouped by identifying categories (such as cause, geographic location or curator). CanadaHelps may choose to offer, modify, or stop offering Cause Funds at any time. Additional terms may apply to any donations may through CanadaHelps’ Website, including to Cause Funds.

Gifts made through CanadaHelps are unrestricted. If a Fund has been created by a charity, the selection of this Fund by the donor will be communicated to the charity; however, if a charity cannot use the gift for the purposes identified in the Fund, or if the Fund is deleted by the charity after the donation has been created, the donation will be used at the discretion of the recipient charity where it is deemed to be needed most.
