Gifts made through CanadaHelps are unrestricted. If a Fund has been created by a charity, the selection of this Fund by the donor will be communicated to the charity; however, if a charity cannot use the gift for the purposes identified in the Fund, or if the Fund is deleted by the charity after the donation has been created, the donation will be used at the discretion of the recipient charity where it is deemed to be needed most.
