===================

Last Updated: November 30, 2022.

**3.WHY DO WE PROCESS YOUR DATA AND ON WHAT BASIS?**
----------------------------------------------------

### **3.1. BASIS**

When we process or collect your data, we ensure that we have a valid basis for doing so. Below, you can find examples of the different purposes for which we process your data and the bases for those reasons: 

In order to provide well-maintained Services to you, improve your experience as a user, and ensure a fair and safe environment for all users, we may process your data to:

* create and maintain an account for you in our Services, that in some Games allows you to save and synch your gameplay across devices;
* provide the correct version (language, etc.) of our Services to you;
* verify your purchases or other transactions;

* troubleshoot or debug any bugs, errors, or other issues in our Services;
* measure and analyze aggregate information about the use of our Services;
* conduct surveys or other research to learn more about our users; or
* improve our current Services or develop new Services;
* personalize your gameplay experience in our Games based on your activity in those Games;

* provide you with offers and rewards in our Games based on your activity in those Games;
* send you service-related communications, such as support requests or otherwise manage our relationship with you.
* moderate and monitor the use of our Services to ensure that our [Terms of Service](http://games.computerlunch.com/terms-of-service/) are followed;
* detect, investigate, or prevent fraud or fraudulent or otherwise unauthorized behavior;
* audit our operations or processes (for example, to verify that they function as intended and according to regulatory or contractual requirements); 
* establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations;
* comply with legal obligations which we believe apply to us (including accounting and tax requirements and requirements to provide information to competent authorities upon due request); 
* protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another person; 
* keep track of your activity in our Games to learn about your interests and improve the advertising in our Games;
* personalize, or ask our advertising partners to personalize, the ads you see in our Games to make them more relevant to you; or 
* achieve additional purposes which are compatible with any of the purposes listed above

In order to promote our Services and to make sure we reach interested audiences, we may process your data to:

* keep track of installations of our Games (including the source of each install);
* measure, analyze, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising (including our advertising outside of our Services); or
* send you communications about offers, rewards, events, or other news related to our Services or other operations.

With your consent, we may process your data to:

* send you newsletters or other similar communications if you have subscribed to them;
* request our advertising partners to show or not show our ads to you based on your activity;
* request our advertising partners to advertise our Games or other Services to audiences who they believe have interests similar to yours; or
* achieve other purposes explained to you when we ask for your consent.

### **3.2. ADVERTISING**

Advertising is one of the tools that helps fund our Services and enables us to make our Games available free of charge. In some of our Games, we may show our own ads and also ads from third parties. We also advertise our Games outside of our Services on third-party properties such as websites or applications. This section provides more information on how we may use your data for advertising purposes, and how you can control the use of your data for these purposes. Mobile advertising relies on the use of certain online identifiers, in particular Advertising IDs but also IP addresses or other identifiers. An “**Advertising ID**” is an alphanumeric string of digits provided by the operating system of your mobile device (e.g. your phone or tablet). It is consistent across applications from different publishers. The Advertising ID is known as the Identifier for Advertisers (“**IDFA**”) on iOS devices and Google Advertising Identifier (“**GAID**”) on Android devices. Advertising IDs are used for interest-based advertising and other advertising related purposes. You can control the extent to which your Advertising ID is used for these purposes. Using the privacy settings on your device, you can typically reset and/or limit the use of your Advertising ID. For example, you can “limit ad tracking” on iOS devices or “opt out of interest-based ads” on Android devices. These settings are specific to each device, which means that you should set them as you prefer on each of your devices individually. It may take some time for your updated settings to take effect. Please consider that resetting or limiting the use of your Advertising ID will not stop you from seeing ads or necessarily reduce the number of ads you see, but the ads you see may be less relevant to you and will not be served based on your personal data. For more information on mobile privacy settings, you may refer to third-party resources such as: [https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice](https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice)**When you see ads in our Games**, we may share your Advertising ID and IP address with our advertising partners if you have given your consent to the use of your data for personalized ads. Our advertising partners may also collect information directly from our Games through technologies such as software development kits (SDKs). In each case, they may use your data for a number of purposes, including to limit the number of times you see an ad or to personalize the ads you see to make them more relevant to you (for example, based on the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID). For more information, please refer to the privacy policies of our advertising partners listed [here](https://www.tiltingpoint.com/data-recipients). If you do not provide us with consent to use your data for personalized ads, we will not share your personal data (such as Advertising ID) with our advertising partners and will indicate to them that you have not consented to the use of this data for personalized ads.  
  
**When you see our ads outside of our Services** (for example, on third-party properties such as websites or applications), the ad network involved in delivering that ad to you may, based on information such as the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID, have determined that you may be interested in our Services. Ad networks may also use your data to:

* limit the number of times you see our ads;
* inform users who have previously played our Games about new content, updates, or other news related to those Games; or
* refrain from showing our ads to users who already play the Game being advertised.

In addition, ad networks may provide services where they use Advertising IDs or other identifiers to find users who are likely to be interested in our Services because their past activity or interests are similar to those of others known by the ad network to use our Services. When ad-networks use your Advertising ID in these ways, they do so based on their respective privacy policies or notices.

**For both ads in our Games and our ads outside of our Services**, Advertising IDs or other identifiers are also used for ad measurement, which involves the collection of metrics such as total views, clicks, or installs generated by an ad. Measurement data may be directly or indirectly collected or received by multiple parties involved in ad delivery (including us and our advertising partners), for example through technologies such as web beacons inserted into ads. This data is used for purposes such as to provide measurement services, to detect, investigate and prevent fraud or fraudulent behavior, or to settle payments between the parties involved in ad delivery.

**4\. WHAT DATA DO WE PROCESS?**
--------------------------------

We may process the following data relating to you:

* your name, email address, or other contact information if you have provided them to us (for example, when registering an account or subscribing to our communications);
* online identifiers such as your in-game alias, IP address, internal identifiers we assign to your account, or hardware or operating system based identifiers including your Advertising ID or device ID;

* if you make purchases in our Games, information we receive from third-party payment service providers to validate those purchases;
* if you participate in our surveys or other research, any comments, feedback, responses, or other information you provide to us when doing so (for example, information about your background or experience with our Games);
* any other information you choose to submit to us through our Services or other information explained to you when asking for your consent to process it.

We do not expect or intend to collect or otherwise process any special categories of data relating to you, such as genetic, biometric or health information, information revealing racial or ethnic origin, sex life or sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership, or information about your criminal offences or convictions. Please do not provide this kind of information to us or use the Services to make it available to others.

**5\. WHERE DO WE COLLECT YOUR DATA FROM?**

We may collect data relating to you from the following sources:

* directly from you when you submit it to us (for example, when registering an account with us, subscribing to our communications, sending support enquiries to us, or responding to our surveys);
* directly from you and/or your device by automatic means when you use our Services or interact with our ads outside of our Services (for example, on third-party websites or applications), including through cookies or similar technologies or software development kits (SDKs);
* if you interact with ads in our Games or our ads outside of our Services (for example, on third-party websites or applications), from our advertising partners involved in the delivery and measurement of those ads;
* if you choose to connect a third-party account with our Services, from the third-party account provider;
* if you make purchases in our Services, from the third-party payment service provider involved in those transactions; or
* with your consent, from other sources explained to you when asking for your consent.

Providing data to us is not mandatory. However, we are unable to provide the Services, or some parts or features of the Services, without processing your data. If you use our Services, we will collect data relating to you for some or all of the purposes described in this Policy, depending on the Services you decide to use and your choices when using them. You have a number of options to limit or control the extent to which your data is processed. For example, you can choose to not connect your third-party accounts with our Games, use your device settings to reset or limit the use of your Advertising ID, or withhold consent for customized advertising in your device settings.

**8\. HOW DO WE SECURE YOUR DATA?**

When you submit a request to exercise your rights, we are required to verify that you are the consumer to whose personal information the request relates or a person authorized to act on that consumer’s behalf. If you submit your request using the automated tools provided in our Games, we will usually not need additional information to verify your request.

2. How We Collect, Use, and Share Your Personal Information

What follows is a summary of how we may collect, use, and share your personal information. the summary is provided in the format we believe to be required by the CCPA. Please review our Privacy Policy, above, for additional information.  
  
We regularly collect the following categories of personal information specified in the CCPA:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Category of personal information** | **Examples** | **Sources** |
| Identifiers | In-game alias, IP address, hardware or operating system based identifiers, email address, or identifiers we assign to your account. | Directly from you (including automatically when you interact with our Games), our advertising partners (to the extent you interact with our ads outside of our Games), third-party account providers (if you link a third-party account to our Games), or third-party payment service providers (if you make purchases in our Games). |
| Commercial information | Information regarding your virtual items or currency in our Games, including records of purchases you may have made. | Directly from you (including automatically when you interact with our Games) and third-party payment service providers (if you make purchases in our Games). |
| Internet or other electronic network activity information | Information on your activity in our Games (for example, your game progress or your interactions with ads in our Games). | Directly from you (including automatically when you interact with our Games), our advertising partners (to the extent you interact with our ads outside of our Games). |
| Geolocation data | Your coarse location (for example, country, state, or city), determined based on your IP address. | Directly from you (including automatically when you interact with our Games). |
| Inferences drawn from this information to create a profile about you | Your geolocation or preferences used to personalize our Games for you. | We make these inferences based on the other categories of information. |

  
We may use this information for the following business purposes specified in the CCPA:

* auditing related to an interaction with you and concurrent transactions;
* detecting security incidents, protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and prosecuting those responsible for that activity;
* debugging to identify and repair errors in our services;
* short-term, transient uses;
* performing our services;
* internal research for technological development and demonstration; or
* activities to verify or maintain the quality or safety of our services, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance our services.

We may share the information with recipients such as our service providers to achieve these business purposes. This means that we may disclose the categories of personal information listed above for a business purpose.  
  
In addition, some features of our Games (for example surveys, or tools used to contact our player support) may allow you to submit information about yourself to us. We may collect any information you choose to submit to us using these features. In addition to the personal information listed in the table above, this may include other categories of personal information specified in the CCPA, including:

* characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (for example, sex or age);
* any categories of personal information described in subdivision (e) of Section 1798.80 of the California Civil Code;
* professional or employment-related information; or

We may use the personal information you choose to submit for performing our services (for example, to handle your support enquiries) and short-term, transient uses, and we may share the information with recipients such as our service providers to achieve these business purposes. This means that we may disclose these categories of personal information for a business purpose.  

3. How We May Sell Your Personal Information

Under the CCPA, a business is required to provide notice to a consumer before the business sells the consumer’s personal information to third parties. the CCPA defines a “sale” as not only exchanges for monetary consideration, but also disclosures of personal information for other valuable consideration.  
  
We do not sell your personal information in exchange for money. However, we may disclose a limited amount of your personal information (i) to our advertising partners to enable them to deliver an ad that is relevant to you or (ii) to our marketing partners to enable them to send you relevant offers when you have opted in to such communication. This includes the following categories of your personal information:

* identifiers (generally including an advertising ID and your IP address for ad partners and name and email for marketing partners); and
* internet or other electronic network activity information (including technical information required to select and deliver the appropriate ad type and format).

Because this disclosure of information could be deemed a “sale” in the meaning of the CCPA, we either ask for your explicit consent or provide a means for you to direct us to not disclose your personal information to our advertising or marketing partners for the above purposes. To learn how to exercise your right to opt-out, please see “Right to Opt Out,” above.

If we have actual knowledge that you are under 16 years old, we will not sell your personal information without affirmative authorization.
