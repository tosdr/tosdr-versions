#### 1\. What personal data do we process about you and where do we get it?

##### When you use our Website and/or otherwise contact Logically

When visiting our Website, you may sign up to be provided with information about our products and services, request product information and/or make an enquiry through our online contact form or otherwise contact us directly, for example by phone or email. We will process any personal data you provide to us, such as your contact details (such as name, email address and/or phone number) and any other information you include in your enquiries or submissions.

We will also automatically collect the following information each time you visit the Website: browser type and version, how long you spend on a page and on our Website, type of device, screen resolution, operating system and interface, your domain name, if applicable, the website from which you are visiting us (referrer URL), webpage(s) you are visiting on our Website, the date and time of accessing our Website, and your internet protocol (IP) address.

##### When you publish information and/or posts on social media and other publicly available websites

Logically’s mission is to reduce and eventually eliminate the harms associated with mis- and disinformation. Logically therefore scans social media platforms and other sites to detect these harms and other potential threats. By virtue of the provision of some of our services to our customers or to develop our products and services, Logically may be processing your personal data, which you have published on the internet. Some of our products and services involve us ingesting large volumes of data sourced from social platforms and other websites. This means that we may, for example, process your personal data from your social media profile such as name, username, photograph, demographic information such as interests or gender, geolocation information, employment information, audio/visual information you post or interact with or the content of your posts. If your social media posts or the information you publish on a publicly available website contains personal data then we may process this as well, for example if you include personal data about yourself in a Twitter post. We use this information to identity emerging threats, including disinformation campaigns, produce reports, conduct fact-checking exercises.

##### Sensitive personal data

Some of the personal data that we process may be deemed sensitive under data protection laws, such as the UK GDPR. For example, we may process personal data relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religious or philosophical beliefs, health data or data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation. We will only process sensitive categories of personal data about you where this is authorised by data protection laws. This will be the case where we process this type of personal data about you because you have made it public by virtue of processing data from social media platforms or other websites. For example, if you reveal your political opinions in a publicly available Facebook post.

##### When we do business with our customers, suppliers and business partners

To the extent permitted by applicable law, Logically may collect and process personal data concerning our customers, suppliers, investors and business partners (and their representatives), such as name, contact details (for example, email address, telephone number, residential address), job title and employer-related information and other business- related information that you or your employer make available to us.

Transfers to third parties located in countries which are not deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection take place using a lawful data transfer mechanism, such as the ICO’s international data transfer agreement, the ICO’s UK Addendum, the EU Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules, approved Codes of Conduct and Certifications, or on the basis of permissible statutory derogations, or any other relevant data transfer clauses issued by the UK Secretary of State or the UK Information Commissioner (and approved by the Parliament).

In certain circumstances, you might provide us with another person’s personal data – (for example, contact details of your colleagues who can assist with certain orders). In these cases, we require you to inform that person that you will be sharing their personal data with us and the purposes for which you will share it. Please provide them with a link to or copy of this Policy and our contact details. Please also let them know that they should contact us if they have any additional questions about how we will use their personal data.

#### 7\. Your data protection rights

Under data protection laws, you may be able to exercise the following rights regarding your personal data:

##### Access

You may have the right to obtain from us confirmation if personal data is being processed by us, and related information; and the right to obtain a copy of your personal data undergoing the processing.

##### Rectification

You may have the right to request the rectification of inaccurate personal data and to have incomplete data completed.

##### Objection

Where we process your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests, you may have the right to object to this processing for reasons relating to your particular situation. If this is the case, we will stop this processing of your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling reasons why we need to process it, which override your rights and freedoms or where we need to process it for the purposes of legal claims. Where we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes, you may have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for this at any time.

##### Portability

You may have the right to receive your personal data that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit it to other data controllers without hindrance. This right only exists if the processing is based on your consent or a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means.

##### Restriction

You may request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain cases, (so that we must suspend the processing, except for storage, with your consent or for legal claims) including for example where you object to us processing your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests or where you want to establish the accuracy or the reason we are processing your personal data.

##### Erasure

You may request to erase your personal data if (i) it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we have collected it, (ii) you have withdrawn your consent and no other legal ground for the processing exists, (iii) you objected and no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing exist, or (iv) the processing is unlawful, or erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation.

##### Right to lodge a complaint

You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. This is the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK but we would ask that you please get in touch with us in the first instance so that we can try to resolve your issue.

##### Right to refuse or withdraw consent

In case we ask for your consent to processing, you are free to refuse to give consent and you can withdraw your consent at any time without any adverse negative consequences. The lawfulness of any processing of your personal data that occurred prior to the withdrawal of your consent will not be affected.

Please be aware that not all of these rights are absolute and that there may be situations in which you cannot exercise them or they are not relevant.

#### 8\. Existence of automated decision-making

In order to provide its services to its clients, Logically may engage in automated decision- making and profiling. For example, identifying Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour (CIB) patterns that assist analyst workflows to investigate narratives.

You have certain rights in relation to this type of processing, including the right not to be subject to solely automated decisions, including profiling. For more information about your rights, please see section 7.

#### 9\. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?

The Website uses cookies and other tracking technologies. Additionally, our email marketing messages may contain tracking beacons, tracked clickable links or similar server technologies in order to track subscriber activity within email marketing messages. Where used, such technologies may record or collect a range of subscriber data relating to engagement, geographic location, demographics and already stored subscriber data.

For further information about our use of cookies and similar technologies, please read our Cookie Policy.

#### 10\. Data security

We use encryption (HTTPS/SSL) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, it is important to note that data transmission over the Internet is never 100% secure. You should therefore take reasonable measures to ensure your account is secured. You use our services at your own risk, and you are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.

#### 11\. Third party embeds, third party links, downloads and media files

Logically often uses content hosted on other sites (such as articles and videos from news publications). This content is not hosted by Logically and therefore these files send data back to the hosted site as if you were visiting that site directly. Logically cannot control the data or what is done with the data collected from third parties in these cases, therefore third party embeds on Logically services are not covered by this Policy.

Embeds may request your personal information through forms (for example: they may ask for your email address). In choosing to give your personal information to a third party, the third party may process your personal data. This Policy does not cover what third parties do with the information you choose to provide them so please ensure you have read and understand the third party's privacy policy prior to submitting any personal information through a third party form.

Any downloadable documents, files or media made available on this Website are provided to you at your own risk. While all precautions have been undertaken to ensure only genuine downloads are available, we advise you to verify their authenticity using third party anti-virus software or similar applications. We accept no responsibility for third party downloads and downloads provided by external third party websites and similarly advise you to verify their authenticity using third party anti-virus software or similar applications.
