The Service is available as a Free plan for personal use, a paid Pro plan for professional use by individuals, and a Business plan for professional use by teams or organizations. As a Free user, you can at any time choose to upgrade your account, which will give you additional Pro features in the rooms you own. The Pro features will then be available to all guests visiting the room, even if they’re anonymous. We reserve the right to change the features included in our plans, the price of the paid plan and the structure of the plan at any time. The Business plan requires creation of a custom subdomain (company.imind.com). By signing up for a Business account, you confirm that you are a legal representative, or are acting on behalf of such person, of the company name used in the account subdomain. You may not set up an account that impersonates or infringes on other’s trademarks.
