What is cockfile?
-----------------

cockfile is a simple to use free file hosting service. It lets you share your photos, documents, music, videos and more with others online for 12 hours.

What files are allowed?
-----------------------

cockfile welcomes uploading all files, as long as the file is legal in France and you have the legal right to publish the file on our service.

As an exception to this policy to prevent abuse, we do not allow malware on our service. Any malware that could be used to infect other computers may be removed from our service at our discretion.

Do you keep logs of uploaded files?
-----------------------------------

We don't collect or log any data of our users in respect for privacy. We only have files uploaded by our users.

Can you remove my copyrighted file?
-----------------------------------

Please submit your copyright takedown notice to [cockfile.com+abuse@gmail.com](mailto:cockfile.com+abuse@gmail.com). We will handle your notice within 12 hours and disable access to the infringing file after receiving a notice compliant with the Copyright Act 1968.

Can you remove files that are defaming me or otherwise infringing my non-copyright rights?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cockfile respects takedowns for other files when accompanied with a certified France court order. If you are unable to obtain the order, a preliminary injuction or court order is typically also sufficient. Please forward the notice to [cockfile.com+abuse@gmail.com](mailto:cockfile.com+abuse@gmail.com).

Can you remove illegal files?
-----------------------------

Please contact the appropriate law enforcement agency if you notice illegal files hosted on cockfile. We have not been trained or qualified to investigate and fight crimes and enforce the law, so it's not appropriate to send accusations of illegal activity to us. **You must contact the appropriate law enforcement office.** They may then contact us if appropriate.

If you are an Francelaw enforcement official and you need our assistance, please contact [cockfile.com+abuse@gmail.com](mailto:cockfile.com+abuse@gmail.com). If you are a law enforcement official from another country, we may voluntarily cooperate if the crime you are investigating would also be illegal in France.
