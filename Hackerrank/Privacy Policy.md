6\. HOW WE MAY USE AUTOMATED PROCESSING
---------------------------------------

### 6.1. AI Features Generally

If you use our Services as a Candidate, or if we collect your data as a potential Candidate, some features of our Services allow Employers to enable the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and/or other automated processing that relates to you (our “**AI Features**”).

* **Employer Determined**. The Employer determines whether to use our AI Features functionality. Our Services do not make use of AI Features unless the Employer elects to make use of the AI Feature.
* **Results and Employer Discretion**. The results generated by our AI Features are made available to the Employer. The Employer retains ultimate discretion as to how to interpret and act on (or not act on) those results.
* **Not for Unique Identification**.  We do not use any data collected or processed via our AI Features for the purpose of uniquely identifying you.
* **No Training on Your Data**.  We do not train any of our AI Feature models on your personal data, nor do we authorize our third party provides of any AI Features to train their models on your data.

### 6.2. Candidate Detection AI Features

If you participate in our AI Features as a Candidate, those AI Features may use artificial intelligence or machine learning to monitor a Candidate’s use of the Candidate Feature to, depending on the AI Feature, capture a Candidate's facial image taken from your webcam or device at intervals during your participation and analyze those images for the purpose of detecting changes to the facial images, or to analyze patterns of your coding and interactions and behavior within a Candidate Feature to indicate whether answers may be copied from or generated or assisted by using another unauthorized source.  We will provide Candidates with notice and ask for your consent before you participate in a Candidate Feature that uses AI Features. If the Employer enables an AI Feature and you do not consent to the use of the AI Feature, you may not be able to participate in that Candidate Feature and you should contact the Employer to discuss any alternative options it may offer.

### 6.3. Potential Candidate AI Features

Employers may use other AI Features to search for potential Candidates based on data we have collected or received.  In this case, our AI Features will process your data to determine whether you maybe a potential Candidate that meets the Employer's search criteria and return those results to the Employer.  The Employer may elect to contact you as a potential Candidate.  When processing your data as a potential Candidate, we only process your data prior to the Employer's decision whether to engage with you and prior to your initial interaction with the Employer, if any, and prior to the Employer making any employment-related decisions related to you.

### 6.4. Other Automated Processing

Aside from our AI Features, we and our service providers may use other automated processing and/or automated decision making where it is necessary to enter into or perform a contract between you and HackerRank or to detect or prevent fraud, abuse, or violations of our Offerings. By using our Services, you consent to our use of automated processing/decision making for this purpose. We may update the automated techniques and tools we use over time.

8\. YOUR RIGHTS IN YOUR DATA
----------------------------

### 8.1. GDPR (European Economic Area)

If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have rights in your data under the General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”).

When using our Services as a User or Candidate, then the Employer inviting you or granting you access to our Services is the “data controller” and HackerRank is the “data processor” under the GDPR. In that case, HackerRank will process your data in accordance with the agreement between HackerRank and the Employer.

**_GDPR Rights_**

If we collect or process your data other than as a User or Candidate, then HackerRank is the “data controller” under the GDPR.  In that case, you have the following rights in your data:

* **The right of access** to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data are being processed and to obtain certain information about your data we process. You can find much of that information within this Privacy Policy;
* **The right to request that we rectify** any data you believe is inaccurate and that we complete any data you believe is incomplete;
* **The right to request that we erase** your data in certain situations, including where it is no longer necessary for us to hold the data, where you withdraw your previous consent to our processing of the data and we have no other legal basis to continue processing the data, where you object to our legitimate interest for processing without us having overriding grounds, or where you believe our processing is unlawful;
* **The right to request that we restrict processing** of your data in certain situations;
* **The right to portability of your data**, which allows you to request that we transfer your data to another organization or directly to you;
* **The right to object to/stop our processing** of your data where processing is based on our legitimate interests and we do not have an overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing. You have the right to object to our processing of your data for marketing purposes, including where we build profiles for such purposes, and we will stop processing your data for that purpose;
* **The right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing** without your consent, including building profiles for such purposes, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect, except to the extent automated processing is permitted by the GDPR. Note that, if an AI Feature as used by the Employer requires your consent and you do not consent, you will not be able to participate in Candidate Features that use the AI Feature.
* In addition, if you consider our processing of your data to be in violation of your rights under GDPR, you have the right to complain to your applicable data protection supervisory authority.

Limits on GDPR Rights

Note that your rights in your data listed above have some limits under GDPR. For example, you may not be able to exercise your GDPR rights if fulfilling your request would adversely affect other individuals or our trade secrets or intellectual property, where there is an overriding public interest, or where we are required by law to retain your personal data.

**8.2.** **Residents of California and Other Applicable U.S. States** 

If you are a resident of California, your rights in your data are governed by the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the “**CCPA**”). If you are a resident of another U.S. state having laws governing your data privacy rights in your personal data or personal information, your rights may be governed by the applicable data protection laws of your jurisdiction.

When using our Services as a User or Candidate, the Employer granting you access to our Services is the “business” under the CCPA, and HackerRank is the “service provider” under the CCPA. In that case, HackerRank will process your data in accordance with the agreement between HackerRank and the Employer.

**_CCPA Rights_**

When we collect your data other than as a User or Candidate, then HackerRank is the “business” under CCPA. In that case, you have the following rights:

* **The right to request that we delete** the personal information we have collected from you (and direct our third-party service providers to do the same). This right is subject to several exceptions where the information is necessary for us or a third party to do any of the following:
    * complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide services to you, or otherwise perform a contract between you and HackerRank;
    * help to ensure security and integrity of the Offerings;
    * debug to identify and repair errors that impair our Offerings;
    * exercise free speech, ensure the right of another to exercise that their right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law;
    * comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 of Title 12 of Part 2 of the California Penal Code;
    * engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interests that conforms or adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws when our deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the ability to complete such research, if you have provided your informed consent;
    * making internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us and compatible with the context in which you provided the information; or
    * comply with a legal obligation.
* **The right** **to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information** we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of processing the personal information.
* **The right to know/request that we disclose** to you the following details about your data we collect: the categories of personal information we have collected; the categories of sources from which we collect your data; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing your data; the categories of third parties to whom we disclose your data; and the specific pieces of data we have collected about you. We have sought to include this information in this Privacy Policy.
* **The right to not be discriminated against** for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA.
* **The right to limit our use of your “Sensitive Personal Information”** (as defined by the CCPA), to that which is necessary to provide reasonably expected services to you, if we collect any “Sensitive Personal Information” for our own purposes outside of providing our Services to an Employer.

Data Collected Over the Past 12 Months

The categories of personal information we may have collected over the past 12 months are listed in the “Data We Collect and Process” section of this Privacy Policy.

We Do Not Sell or Share Personal Information

**HackerRank does not sell your information to third parties, nor do we share your information with third parties for any** **cross-context behavioral advertising purposes as defined by the CCPA**. If, in the future, we intend to sell or share your information as defined by the CCPA, we will provide you notice and you will have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information via a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” or similar link and to request certain information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties.
