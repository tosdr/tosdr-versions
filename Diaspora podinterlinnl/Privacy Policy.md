diaspora\* - Terms of Service Last Updated: 17th August, 2014
=============================================================

Here are the important things you need to know about accessing and using the **diaspora\*** (https://pod.interlin.nl/) website and service (collectively, "Service"). These are our terms of service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.

Accepting these Terms
---------------------

If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all of the terms. If you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the Service.

Changes to these Terms
----------------------

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for some other reason.

Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective six (6) weeks after we post such revised Terms to our website (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms), or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check the website regularly for changes to these Terms.

If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have accepted the revised Terms.

Privacy Policy
--------------

For information about how we collect and use information about users of the Service, please check out our [privacy policy](#privacy).

Third-Party Services
--------------------

From time to time, we may provide you with links to third party websites or services that we do not own or control. Your use of the Service may also include the use of applications that are developed or owned by a third party. Your use of such third party applications, websites, and services is governed by that partyâ€™s own terms of service or privacy policies. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third party application, website or service that you visit or use. Note that while **diaspora\*** itself does not work directly with advertisers, third party applications may contain advertising or marketing materials provided by such third parties.

Creating Accounts
-----------------

When you create an account, you may use any name (real, fake or otherwise) for other users to see. However, if you create a "parody" account of a real living person, you must clearly label your account as such. Accounts that are not clearly marked as such and that impersonate other people without permission can be deleted without warning.

When you create an account you also agree to maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account data and any other information you provide to **diaspora\***.

If you discover or suspect any Service security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible. For security holes in the diaspora\* software itself, please contact [the developers directly](mailto:security@diasporafoundation.org).

Your Content & Conduct
----------------------

Our Service allows you and other users to post, link and otherwise make available content. You are responsible for the content that you make available to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

When you post, link or otherwise make available content to the Service, you grant us the right and license to display and distribute your content on or through the Service (including via applications). We may format your content for display throughout the Service, but we will not edit or revise the substance of your content itself. The displaying and distribution of your content happens strictly only according to the visibility rules you have set for the content. We will not modify the visibility of the content you have set.

We cannot be held responsible should a programming or administrative error make your content visible to a larger audience than you had intended.

Aside from our limited right to your content, you retain all of your rights to the content you post, link and otherwise make available on or through the Service.

You can remove the content that you posted by deleting it. Once you delete your content, it will not appear on the Service, but copies of your deleted content may remain in our system or backups for some period of time. Web server access logs might also be stored for some time in the system.

Since diaspora\* is a distributed social network, it is possible, depending on the visibility rules set to your content, that your content has been distributed to other diaspora\* pods. When you delete your content, we will request those other pods to also delete the content. Our responsibility on the content being deleted from those other pods ends here. If for some reason, some other pod does not delete the content, we cannot be held responsible.

In order to make **diaspora\*** a great place for all of us, please do not post, link and otherwise make available on or through the Service any of the following:

* Content that is libelous, defamatory, bigoted, fraudulent or deceptive;
* Content that is illegal or unlawful, that would otherwise create liability;
* Content that may infringe or violate any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy, right of publicity or other intellectual or other right of any party;
* Mass or repeated promotions, political campaigning or commercial messages directed at users who do not follow you (SPAM);
* Private information of any third party (e.g., addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers); and
* Viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files or code.

Also, you agree that you will not do any of the following in connection with the Service or other users:

* Use the Service in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Service or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Service;
* Impersonate or post on behalf of any person or entity or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;
* Collect any personal information about other users, or intimidate, threaten, stalk or otherwise harass other users of the Service;
* Circumvent or attempt to circumvent any filtering, security measures, rate limits or other features designed to protect the Service, users of the Service, or third parties.
