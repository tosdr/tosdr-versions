You undertake that any such contribution complies with those standards. You do not have a legal claim to the publication of any material uploaded to our site.  
5.2 Our site may offer opportunities for you to transmit messages in connection with various features including email, message boards & chat rooms ("Message Features").

5.4 We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any Message Features provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any Message Features we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any Message Features by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.  
5.5 The use of any of our Message Features by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian.
