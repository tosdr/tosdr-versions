Privacy Policy
==============

Coupa is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. In this privacy policy ("**Privacy Policy**"), we explain how Coupa collects, uses, discloses and protects the Personal Information you submit to us, including, for example, when accessing and using Coupa websites or applying for job offerings.

Our Privacy Policy has been drafted to comply with applicable data privacy laws, in particular, the GDPR and the CCPA. If the GDPR or another Applicable Data Privacy Law does not apply to you, not all terms of this Privacy Policy may be relevant to you.

As used in this Privacy Policy,

* “**Applicable Data Privacy Laws**” may include (i) EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“**GDPR**”), (ii) other data protection laws applicable in member states of the EEA, (iii) the UK Data Protection Act 2018, (iv) any U.S. privacy, security, breach notification, or other data protection laws applicable to Personal Information, including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code 1798.100 et seq (“**CCPA**”).
* “**Coupa**”, "**we**," "**our**" and "**us**" means **Coupa Software Inc**. and its affiliates.
* “**Coupa Platform**” means any software and hardware that enables Coupa to provide our customers and their business partners with access to and use of the Coupa services, including the [Coupa Supplier Portal](https://supplier.coupahost.com/sessions/new).
* “**Controller**” or “**Processor**” (as applicable) for the purposes of the GDPR, other data protection laws applicable in member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is **Coupa Software Inc.**, 950 Tower Lane, 20th Floor, Foster City, CA 94404, USA.
* “**Personal Information**” generally has the same meaning as personal data or personal identifiable information (PII). Personal Information is defined in the data privacy laws applicable in your country. It includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This means any individual who can be identified directly or indirectly by reference to an identifier such as name, identification number, location data, online identifiers (for example, IP addresses – if they can be used to identify you) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Put simply, this includes data which either by itself or with other data held by us or available to us, can be used to identify you.

**Coupa's role**

Coupa is acting in the capacity of Controller when collecting and processing personal data on its own behalf and for its own purposes. This means situations in which Coupa determines the purposes and the means of such processing at its own discretion.

For certain services, Coupa has been retained by our customers to process personal data as a Processor. In such cases, Coupa shall process your personal data on behalf of and based on the specific instructions given by our customer as the Controller. The subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purposes of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects, together with the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to such processing will be covered by a data processing agreement (or equivalent terms) agreed between Coupa and our customer.

When a Coupa customer uploads personal data (typically contact information) of their business partners (suppliers, prospective suppliers or other) to the Coupa Platform, then the Coupa customer is the Controller of such personal data. If a business partner creates a supplier account on the Coupa Supplier Portal, then Coupa is the Controller of any personal data provided.

Coupa is committed to the following key principles:

**Principle 1.** We limit how, and with whom, we share your Personal Information.

Coupa will only share your Personal Information with others for the following purposes:

* at your request;
* to process or service a transaction or product authorized or requested by you; this may include sharing within the Coupa group of entities;
* when required by law to disclose such information to appropriate authorities;
* to companies that assist us in marketing, placement and servicing our products and services; for example, in order to support our information technology or to handle mailings on our behalf;
* to our event sponsors and partners in connection with event registrations and marketing events, which may include sharing Personal Information with our sponsors and partners for their own commercial purposes if permitted by applicable law without your consent (See “Marketing Information” section herein);
* to companies that assist us in our job recruiting efforts or evaluating job applications; and
* to our professional advisers.

We do not sell Personal Information for money but some third-party cookies on our website or some of our relationships with event sponsors and partners may be considered a "sale" or “sharing” as defined under the CCPA.

**Principle 2**. We collect only the information necessary to deliver the products and services you request.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy may be modified from time to time to comply with applicable laws or to conform to our current business practices. We will post any changes to this on our website and, if required by applicable law, will endeavor to notify you via your contact email. We encourage you to revisit the Privacy Policy that is posted on our web site from time to time to check for updates.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE WANT YOU TO KNOW:**

**Transfers outside the EU/EEA.** We also transfer the Personal Information we process to countries outside the European Economic Area (”**EEA**”) (e.g., when one of our service providers or equipment is based outside the EEA, such as for hosting your Personal Information). We have put in place adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of your privacy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the exercise of your rights, e.g. we establish an adequate level of data protection, usually through EU Standard Contractual Clauses based on the EU commission’s model clauses or by way of compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework described below, as applicable.

**Data Privacy Framework (DPF).** Coupa complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Coupa has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Coupa has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.

**Provision of Personal Information / Automated decision making.** Please note that the Personal Information we collect from you is necessary to providing the services and the website to you. Failure to provide such data may not enable us to provide our services to you or make our website accessible. We do not use automatic decision-making or profiling of individuals.

**Your Rights.** You may have various rights under data privacy laws in your country or state. These may include (where required by law): the right to request access (right to know) to the Personal Information we hold about you; the right to rectification (right to correct) including to require us to correct inaccurate Personal Information; the right to request restriction of processing concerning you or to object to processing of your Personal Information, the right to request the erasure (right to delete) of your Personal Information where it is no longer necessary for us to retain it; the right to data portability including to obtain Personal Information in a commonly used machine readable format in certain circumstances such as where our processing of it is based on a consent; the right to opt out of sales or sharing of your Personal Information; the right to object to automated decision making including profiling (if any) that has a legal or significant effect on you as an individual; and the right to withdraw your consent to any processing for which you have previously given that consent.

**Marketing Information.** With your consent (if obtaining such consent is required by law), we will keep your name, address and contact details (including telephone numbers and email addresses) in our databases and may from time to time use that information to make you aware of our related products and services as well as updates on developments in our industry sector generally which may be of interest to you. We may contact you in writing, by telephone or email for this. If permitted by applicable law, we may share such information with our event sponsors and/or partners for their own commercial purposes without your consent. If at any time you decide that you do not want your contact details used or shared for these purposes, where applicable, you may object or revoke your consent for receiving marketing communications by following the instructions in the relevant marketing communication (e.g., clicking on the “Unsubscribe” button), by contacting us (see “Give Us Your Feedback” above), or, if applicable to the scenario, by visiting the preference center at [https://www.coupa.com/preference-center.html](https://www.coupa.com/preference-center).

**Security Statement.** We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. In particular, we implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including as appropriate: (a) pseudonymisation (such as where data is separated from direct identifiers so that linkage to an identity is not possible without additional information that is held separately) and encryption, (b) protecting the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of systems and services used to process your Personal Information, (c) providing the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Information in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and (d) maintaining a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational security measures. When you submit information to us through our website, your information is protected both online and offline. All data transferred to/from the Coupa internal network, from/to an external entity, is encrypted to industry standards (256-bit encryption). Please keep in mind that messages you send to us by Internet e-mail may not be secure. We maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your personal information within our company. Only those employees who may require your information to perform a specific job are granted access to your organization’s identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices.
