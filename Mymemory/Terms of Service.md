Service Terms and Conditions of Use
===================================

MyMemory is a collection of searchable translations provided by its users. This content comes in the form of sentences pairs (a sentence plus its own translation), referred to as **_"segments"_**, each one tagged with the language names, author name (if provided), dates and other metadata.

Privacy policy
--------------

### Definition of public, private and personal data

We will refer as **_"Public Data"_** (or "Public Contributions") to all the segments contributed to the archive of translations made by users that were not explicitly marked as private. We will refer as **_"Private Data"_** (or "Private Contributions") to all the segments contributions to the archive of translations made by users that explicitly were marked as private. We will refer as **_"Personal Data"_** to all the information provided by the users about their identity

1. during authentication flows, necessary to access our service;
2. during web browsing or API consuming, used for tracking purposes;

### Information collected during your visit

We collect any segment submitted and store it on a long term basis, whether it’s public or private.  
We may collect tracking data and send cookies in order to provide a better user experience during your visit.  
We may collect information such as IP address, visiting time, duration, etc. for internal logging purposes.  
When you log into any of our services, we collect the "Personal Data" you submit in order to provide these services.  

### How we use information we collect

We will not share, sell or transfer "Personal Data" to third parties without users' express consent.  
  
We will not use "Private Contributions" to provide translation memory matches to other MyMemory's users and we will not publish these contributions on MyMemory’s public archives.  
The contributions to the archive, whether they are "Public Data" or "Private Data", are collected, processed and used by Translated to create statistics, set up new services and improve existing ones.  
  
We agree that "Private Contributions" made against the "Public Data" archive for a mistake by the user or a software bug by our part will be took off as soon as possible by us in reasonable time periods after a reasonable communication by the end user (in other words, vague requests from unknown users such as "delete all my segments now" without any other coordinates such as usernames, time periods, language pairs, keywords, etc. will be disregarded).  
  
Using and contributing (editing and adding) to the "Public Data" archive doesn't entitle you to any right on it. Translated is entitled full ownership on "Public Data".  

### What information do we share with third parties

MyMemory uses external partners to outsource some developments and provide some functionalities: this involves data sharing. External Machine Translation providers is the most obvious example.  
  
Translated can entitle its partners of a usage license over "Public Data" or "Private Data" in order to improve the quality of our and/or 3rd parties' services (eg. machine translation suggestions, glossaries, language models, spell checkers...).  
  
Holders of this usage license are not entitled of any re-publishing of the raw data (entire documents or segments), but may publish the results of this data processing (eg. improved machine translation output) in a form that does not affect the confidentiality of the data itself.  
  
We are fully committed to ensure that personal information confidentiality is protected and maintained.  

DOs
---

You may:

1. consult the archive from web interface
2. download TMX files
3. upload TMX files
4. contribute to the archive (by adding, deleting or updating existing data)

in a non-automatic and non-systematic fashion. In other words, bots are not allowed to interact with sections of the website meant for humans.

Automated and systematic API access by machines is permitted, but only if it doesn't infringe the "DONT's" section.

DON'Ts
------

You may not:

1. crawl the archive, both by web interface and/or API means (search engines' BOT are allowed to, but carefully monitored)
2. pollute the archive with bogus content
3. generate abnormal traffic that disrupts the service to other users
4. use the APIs the way they are not meant to be used, like translating more than one paragraph at once (this completely defeats the purposes of a collaborative TM)
5. behave against the community and the public services offered by Translated
6. resell Translated's services as they are without Translated express consent
7. try to circumvent usage limits imposed by the staff
