Terms of Use for SAP Websites  

================================

#### 1\. SCOPE

SAP SE, Dietmar-Hopp-Allee 16, 69190 Walldorf/Germany, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively "**SAP**") have created, own, and operate multiple websites, (each individually referred to hereunder as an “**SAP Website**” and collectively “**SAP Websites**”). The SAP Websites allow you ("**You**" or "**Your**") and other SAP software experts, developers, users, and other interested parties (each, a "**User**" and collectively, "**Users**") to engage in a variety of activities, such as find information, purchase and/or research SAP and related software and services, obtain support for SAP software and services, share information with SAP and third parties, post comments, blog, provide reviews, vote on prospective features, and engage in conversations and activities related to SAP’s products and services. The Websites also include information created and published by SAP (**“SAP Materials”**) and third parties (**“User Content”**), such as text, images, photographs, graphics, audio and video, data, code, and software (collectively, the SAP Materials and User Content are referred to as “Content”).

#### 2\. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

Your access and use of the SAP Websites is subject to and governed by these Terms of Use, also referred to as “TOU”, including any additional or different disclaimers, legal notices, agreements, or terms and conditions that may apply to Your use of or access to any particular SAP Website, SAP Materials, or User Content. If there is a conflict between the terms in this TOU and any additional legal terms, the additional legal terms shall control. This TOU forms a legally binding agreement between You and SAP. By clicking an “I Accept” button as part of a registration process, or otherwise demonstrating your consent to this TOU through a process established by SAP, You accept and agree to abide by the terms of this TOU. If You do not agree to the terms of this TOU, You should not click the “I Accept” button (or equivalent) or attempt to access or use any SAP Website, SAP Materials, or User Content. Please note that this TOU does not govern the use of any cloud solutions (e.g., SAP HANA Cloud Platform, SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Fieldglass, SAP Ariba, etc.) provided by SAP and for which You are required to enter into a separate agreement.

SAP may modify the TOU to reflect changes in SAP’s business, applicable law, or for other reasons deemed necessary by SAP. If the terms of the TOU change, SAP will provide notice, which may include, but is not limited to notice provided through the Websites or an SAP user account. Except where prohibited by law, updates to the TOU will apply once the changes have been posted or notice has otherwise been given. Changes to the TOU will, however, not apply retroactively. If You do not agree to changes made to the TOU, You must discontinue your use of the affected SAP Website, SAP Materials, or User Content.

#### 3\. USER CONTENT/LICENSE TO SAP

SAP does not claim ownership of User Content that you post, upload, input or submit to any SAP Website. By posting, transmitting or uploading any User Content, including any article, information, data, code, text, software, documentation, graphic, image, marketing material, video, photograph, message, suggestion, feedback, idea, or posting to any forum, wiki, or blog on any SAP Website, You grant to SAP a perpetual, irrevocable (subject to mandatory data protection requirements), non-exclusive, world-wide, fully-paid up and royalty free license to use such User Content without restrictions of any kind and without any payment or other consideration of any kind, or permission or notification, to you or any third party.

You represent and warrant to SAP that You have the right, title, and/or authority to grant such license to SAP. SAP may elect not to post or publish User Content that You submit. If SAP elects to post or publish Your User Content, SAP may in its sole discretion withdraw the posted or published User Content for any reason and without notice even if SAP has previously indicated to You that SAP might or will post the User Content You have submitted.

You acknowledge and agree that the relationship between You and SAP is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship. SAP shall have the right, but not the obligation, to use Your name, likeness, biography and other information about You that You have provided in connection with any use of the User Content You submit, and SAP may continue to use this information after any termination of your account or Your access to the Websites for the purpose of identifying the source of User Content that you previously submitted. Nothing in this TOU shall prohibit or restrict SAP’s right to create or obtain User Content or submissions similar to or competitive with the User Content that You have submitted.
