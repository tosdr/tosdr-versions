Nasco Education may update this privacy policy by posting a new version on this website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are familiar with any changes. 

**SECURING YOUR DATA**  
Nasco Education takes every precaution to protect our users’ information and email address. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and offline. All school request information forms are encrypted data using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is industry standard and it enables users to enter Personally Identifiable Information in a safe and secure manner. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information offline.  
All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Employees must also use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every month, as well as any time policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected.  
Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. If users have any questions about the security at our website, users can send an email to EducateSupport@NascoEducation.com.

Allow access to website functionality  
Send to you statements and invoices  
Collect payments from you  
Send you marketing communications  
When Nasco Education discloses your personal information to its agents or sub-contractors for these purposes, the agent or sub-contractor in question will be obligated to use that personal information in accordance with the terms of this privacy statement.  
In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere above, Nasco Education may disclose your personal information to the extent that it is required to do so by law, in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings, and in order to establish, exercise or defend its legal rights.
