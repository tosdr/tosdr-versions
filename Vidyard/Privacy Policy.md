[How does Vidyard keep personal information safe?](#collapse-faq-16)

The security of your personal information is important to us. Although we cannot guarantee 100% security, we use reasonably appropriate security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized use, access, modification, destruction or disclosure. We require our third party service providers to use similar safeguards to those we use.

[More](#collapse-faq-15-0)

We employ reasonably appropriate security measures to protect personal information against loss, unauthorized use, access, alteration, modification, disclosure or destruction. These measures include physical, organizational and technological measures. If we use third parties to help us provide our Services, we require such service providers to use similar safeguards to those we use. We also require service providers to limit access to your personal information and to keep it strictly confidential. Service providers are only permitted to use your personal information for the sole purpose of carrying out services on our behalf.

As businesses like Vidyard move towards greater use of technology, there is also an increasing drive to keep information secure and confident. Vidyard’s privacy and information technology compliance program has been independently audited and certified against globally recognized standards.

However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we are committed to protecting your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us.

[Where is personal information stored?](#collapse-faq-17)

Vidyard has its headquarters in Canada and the Vidyard Services are hosted in Canada and the United States. Some or all of the personal information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located in Canada and the United States.

[More](#collapse-faq-16-0)

Canada has received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR.

The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union. Vidyard relies on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR. In particular, Vidyard collects and transfers to the U.S. personal data only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Vidyard in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.

Further, information may also be stored outside the country you reside, whose privacy and data protection laws may differ from your jurisdiction. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions.

Vidyard endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with Vidyard and the practices described in this Privacy Notice. Vidyard also minimizes the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing sensitive information about you.

[How long will personal information be retained?](#collapse-faq-18)

Vidyard retains personal information only as long as necessary to serve the identified purposes for which it was collected, subject to legal requirements.

[Use of Google API Services](#collapse-faq-19)

Certain Services within our platform may allow you to access the contact data in your Google Workspace account (“Contact Data”). If you choose to allow the Services to access Contact Data, we will use this data to identify email addresses that contain the same domain name as the email address you used to register for the Services. We will only use Contact Data to invite your contacts to join you in the Services if you instruct us to invite certain contacts. Our use and transfer to any other application of your Contact Data received from the Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use Requirements. We will not share any Contact Data with third-party applications, including AI models.

[A note about children](#collapse-faq-20)

Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is very important to us. The Vidyard Websites and Vidyard Services are not designed or intended for use by children or anyone under the age of 13. Vidyard does not knowingly collect the information from children. Please contact us at [privacy@vidyard.com](mailto:privacy@vidyard.com) for any concerns or questions about children’s personal information.

[Your California Privacy Rights](#collapse-faq-21)

Do you live in California? California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents that use the Vidyard Websites and Vidyard Services to request certain information regarding how Vidyard discloses their personal information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and what choices they have.

If this applies to you and you would like to make such a request, please contact us at [privacy@vidyard.com](mailto:privacy@vidyard.com). Please include the following in the subject line: **Attention: Privacy Officer – California Privacy Rights.**

Also, we must let you know about Do Not Track signals. Some browsers support a “Do Not Track” feature, which is intended to be a signal to websites that you do not wish to be tracked across different websites you visit. Vidyard Websites do not currently change the way they operate based upon detection of a Do Not Track or similar signal.
