WePay Terms of Service - United States
--------------------------------------

Dated: April 1, 2022

These Terms of Service are a legal agreement (this "Agreement") between you ("user," "you" or "your") and WePay, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("WePay," "we," "our" or "us"). WePay is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”). As used in this Agreement, the "Service" refers to WePay's payment processing services, as well as our website, any software, programs, documentation, tools, hardware, internet-based services, components, and any updates (including software maintenance, service information, help content, bug fixes or maintenance releases) thereto provided to you by WePay, directly or indirectly. Your use of the Service constitutes confirmation of your acceptance and agreement to the terms of this Agreement.

WePay offers the Service through integrations with third-party or Chase websites ("Platforms"). The Platform through which you access the Service might have its own terms of service and privacy policy that apply to you. This Agreement incorporates by reference all policies, notices, and other content that appear on our website at [www.wepay.com](http://www.wepay.com/) as well as policies, notices, and other content concerning the Service that appear on the Platform's website (collectively, the "Website").

1\. Merchant Relationship with WePay
------------------------------------

WePay provides the Service to users ("Merchants") to facilitate receipt by Merchants of payments for goods or services or donations by card and bank transfer. These transactions are between Merchants and persons who pay them ("Purchasers"). Neither WePay, nor any Chase subsidiary or affiliate, is a party to these transactions.

For payments by card, WePay initiates the payment process by providing information to Paymentech, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Paymentech"). Paymentech is a subsidiary of Chase which is a member of Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International ("Visa"), Mastercard International Incorporated ("MasterCard"), American Express Travel Related Services Company Inc. ("American Express"), or other payment card networks, associations, or companies (collectively, the "Card Networks"). Paymentech in its capacity as an authorized processor of transactions and Chase in its capacity as a member of several Card Networks are referred to collectively as the "Bank". WePay shall pay, or cause the Bank to pay, Merchants under both (a) the provisions of its agreement with WePay, and (b) the by-laws, operating regulations and all other rules, policies and procedures of the Card Networks as in effect from time to time (the "Card Network Rules"), that make WePay responsible for instructing settlement with you as a Merchant. For payments by bank transfer, WePay initiates the payment process by providing information to Chase through the National Automated Clearing House ("ACH") in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and The Electronic Payments Association Operating Rules and Guidelines ("ACH Rules"), each as in effect from time to time.

Merchants must register for WePay directly or through the Platform. To register, a Merchant provides information, including email address and a self-selected password, in order to create an account ("Account"). You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your Account access credentials and for any use of or action taken under them.

WePay or the Platform asks Merchants for additional information to identify each person that opens an Account, such as street address, telephone number, tax identification number (such as Social Security Number), date of birth and beneficial ownership information (where applicable). You agree to provide supplemental documentation upon request (including but not limited to: articles of incorporation, passports, driver's license or a business license and financial statements). You agree that the information provided is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge and authorize the Platform and WePay, directly or through third parties, to make inquiries or verify that this information is accurate (for example, through social media or third party databases). You specifically authorize WePay and the Platform to obtain your business credit reports from time to time and use them in connection with establishing and maintaining your Account. You agree to promptly notify WePay or the Platform, as applicable, if there are any significant changes to the nature of your business (including changes to any trade name(s)), product lines or services or in the event any person or entity acquires any beneficial ownership interest in you which is twenty-five percent (25%) or more.

You must provide accurate and complete information to WePay and the Platform. Specifically, when you register, you must demonstrate that you can receive email at the email address you provide. If you do not confirm your email address, then (a) fourteen (14) days after you accept your first payment, you will not be able to accept additional payments, and (b) thirty (30) days after you accept your first payment, the Bank will refund to your Purchasers all of the payments you have accepted. In addition, in order to settle the payments you have accepted to your bank account or other payment instrument, you must provide to WePay or the Platform identity and settlement information (such as your bank account details). If you do not provide identity and settlement information, then (a) thirty (30) days after you accept your first payment, you will not be able to accept additional payments, and (b) unless you provide identity and settlement information promptly, the Bank will refund to your Purchasers all of the payments you have accepted. Finally, if at any time WePay or the Platform is unable to verify that the identity information you provided is correct and up-to-date, then, unless you provide verifiable information promptly, (a) WePay will disable your Account so that you cannot accept additional payments, and (b) the Bank will refund to your Purchasers all of the payments that you have accepted but not settled. Neither the Bank, WePay nor the Platform will have any liability to you for your inability to accept payments or for refunds pursuant to this paragraph.

WePay allows businesses (including sole proprietorships), non-profit organizations and other entities to register for WePay if they are located in one of the 50 United States or the District of Columbia. Residents of Puerto Rico, U.S. territories (such as Guam), and U.S. military bases are not supported. A Merchant must be either a United States citizen, a legal permanent resident of the United States, a United States federal, state or local government agency or a United States business or nonprofit organization having a physical presence in the United States and authorized to conduct business by the state in which it operates. A user who opens an Account must be eighteen (18) years of age or older. You may open an Account for an entity only if it is legitimate and you have the authority to enter into this Agreement on its behalf. Your acceptance of this Agreement constitutes acceptance by the entity.

USA PATRIOT ACT: To help prevent the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law and internal policies require us to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. In order to comply with these requirements, we will ask for your business name, physical address, and government identification number in order to verify your identity.

2\. Purchaser Relationship with WePay
-------------------------------------

This Agreement also applies to Purchasers. In particular, Section 9 of this Agreement applies to Purchasers paying by bank transfer and to payment card information updates.

3\. Platform Relationship with WePay
------------------------------------

Platforms enter into [Platform Terms of Service](https://dev.wepay.com/docs/platform-tos) with WePay.

4\. Limitations on WePay's and Others' Responsibility
-----------------------------------------------------

Neither WePay, the Bank, nor any other third party makes any representations or guarantees regarding Merchants or Purchasers utilizing the Service. Use of our Service in no way represents any endorsement by WePay or any Card Network, of a user's existence, legitimacy, ability, policies, practices, or beliefs. WePay does not have control of, or liability for, goods or services that are paid for with the Service. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that receipt of Purchaser information via the Service does not indicate that the Purchaser’s payment instrument has sufficient available funds, that a transaction will be authorized or processed, or that the transaction will not later result in a chargeback or reversal.

A nonprofit organization may use WePay to accept payments as a Merchant. Not all nonprofit organizations are tax-exempt, and not all contributions to nonprofit organizations are tax-deductible. Nonprofit organizations are responsible for correctly classifying themselves and their transactions, issuing any required reports and receipts, and making any required tax or other filings. Contributors are responsible for verifying the status of organizations to which they donate and reporting their donations correctly for tax and other purposes. WePay specifically disclaims any liability in this regard.

If we (or the Platform) sell or otherwise provide you with terminals or other equipment, (1) we (or the Platform) are the equipment reseller, not the manufacturer, (2) we (or the Platform) will give you pricing and any additional terms (including any manufacturer’s warranty) before purchase, and (3) by accepting the equipment, you agree to any related additional terms.

5\. Merchant Fees
-----------------

Platforms are responsible for setting fees for transaction processing and exceptions processing and disclosing them to their Merchants. Platforms may charge an additional fee for the value-added services they provide. If the Platform does not set transaction processing fees otherwise, then WePay charges the Platform’s Merchants 2.9% + $0.30 for transaction processing; $15.00 per chargeback (in addition to the amount of the chargeback); $15.00 per ACH return (in addition to the amount of the return); and a $25.00 research fee (if an Account is deemed abandoned under Section 22 below). If the Platform does not set refund fees otherwise, then the following refund policies apply. For Merchants with blended rate pricing, if the Merchant refunds a payment in full, WePay and Platform will return their transaction processing fees.  If Merchant refunds a payment in part, WePay will not return its transaction processing fees, and the Platform may choose whether to return its fees. For Merchants with Interchange+ pricing, the refund policy is as specified in the applicable pricing disclosure. Merchants must also reimburse WePay for “Payment Network Liabilities” as defined below in Section 8, Our Role and Your Responsibilities. Typically, fees are netted against other funds due to Merchant or debited from the Merchant’s bank account or other payment instrument associated with the Merchant’s Account. Merchant agrees to pay the fees for the Service that are posted from time to time by WePay or by the Platform.

A Platform may enable a Merchant to increase the amount it collects from Purchasers by these fees or by other amounts. Certain Card Network Rules or state laws may prohibit or impose restrictions on the assessment of surcharges or similar fees added to credit card transactions. It is Merchant’s responsibility to comply with all such applicable Card Network Rules and state laws in connection with its decision to increase the total amount Merchant collects from Purchasers.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, WePay and the Platform reserve the right to change our fees. WePay or the Platform will try, but are not required, to give you 30 days’ notice before the effective date of any change in a fee. By continuing to use the Service, you consent to the change in fees. To withdraw your consent, you must close your Account.

6\. E-Sign Disclosure and Consent
---------------------------------

Electronic Delivery

By accepting this Agreement, you agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, notices and disclosures (collectively, "Communications") that we or the Platform provide in connection with your Account and your use of the Service. Communications include but are not limited to:

1. agreements and policies, such as this Agreement and our Privacy Policy, including updates thereto;
2. annual disclosures;
3. transaction receipts or confirmations;
4. communication in relation to delinquent accounts (which may also be by phone, and may be made by WePay or by anyone on its behalf, including a third party collection agent);
5. Account statements and history; and
6. federal and state tax statements (we may, but are not obligated to, send tax-related information electronically).

We or the Platform will provide these Communications to you by emailing them to you at the primary email address listed in your Account registration, by texting them to you at the primary telephone number listed in your Account registration, by emailing or texting you a link or instructions how to access them on a website, or (if permitted by law) by posting them on the Website. We or the Platform may also provide certain Communications (such as federal and state tax statements) by U.S. mail to the street address listed in your Account registration. Communications are considered received by you within 24 hours of the time they are emailed to you, posted to the Website, or mailed to you. You further agree that your electronic signature has the same effect as your manual, physical signature.

Hardware and Software Requirements
----------------------------------

In order to access and retain electronic Communications, you will need the following computer hardware and software:

1. a computer or mobile device with an Internet or mobile connection;
2. for desktop website-based Communications, a modern web browser that includes 256-bit encryption, such as the current version of Chrome (www.google.com/chrome), Internet Explorer (www.microsoft.com/edge), Mozilla Firefox (www.mozilla.com), or Apple Safari (www.apple.com/safari);
3. for application-based Communications, a recent device operating system that supports text messaging, downloading, and applications from the Apple App Store or Google Play store, and the most recent versions of Apple Safari or Google Chrome on iOS or Google Chrome for Android OS;
4. access to your primary email address registered with WePay or the Platform; and
5. sufficient storage space to save past Communications or an installed printer to print them.

By giving your consent, you are confirming that you have access to the necessary equipment and are able to receive, open, and print or download a copy of any Communications for your records. It is important for you to retain copies of Communications because they may not be accessible in your Account at a later date.

How to Withdraw Your Consent
----------------------------

You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting Customer Support, including by writing to "WePay, Inc., 3223 Hanover St., Palo Alto, CA 94304." If you withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically, WePay or the Platform may deny your registration for an Account, restrict or close your Account, or charge you additional fees for paper copies.

Requesting Paper Copies of Electronic Communications
----------------------------------------------------

If, after you consent to receive Communications electronically, you would like a paper copy of a Communication previously sent to you, you may request a copy within 180 days of the date the Communication was provided to you by contacting Customer Support as described above. We or the Platform will send a paper copy to you by U.S. mail to the street address on file in your Account. You understand and agree that WePay or the Platform may charge you an exceptions fee for each paper copy of a Communication.

Updating Your Contact Information
---------------------------------

It is your responsibility to keep your primary email and street address up to date. You understand and agree that if WePay or the Platform sends you a Communication but you do not receive it because your primary email or street address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, WePay or the Platform will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you. Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add WePay or the Platform to your email address book so that you will be able to receive the Communications we send to you.

If your email address becomes invalid such that electronic Communications sent to you by WePay or the Platform are returned, then WePay or the Platform may close your Account, and you will not be able to transact any activity using your Account until we receive a valid, functioning primary email address from you.

8\. Our Role and Your Responsibilities
--------------------------------------

WePay collects, analyzes and relays information generated in connection with payments between Purchasers and Merchants. You authorize WePay to provide this information to the Bank in order for the Bank to facilitate payments from Purchasers to Merchants through the Card Networks, or the ACH, as applicable. The Bank - and not WePay - actually conducts the settlement of card transactions and ACH transactions to Merchants. 

WePay has entered into agreements with the Card Networks and the Bank. You are not a third-party beneficiary of these agreements. Each of the Card Networks is a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and has beneficiary rights, but not obligations, and may enforce this Agreement against you. Some of the Card Networks may require a direct agreement with you. If you are required to enter into such an agreement and decline to do so, we may suspend or terminate your Account.

You acknowledge that, if you receive payments from American Express exceeding the threshold specified by American Express, you will be converted to a direct card acceptance relationship with American Express and, upon conversion, you will be bound by the then-current American Express Card acceptance agreement and American Express will set the discount and other fees payable by you for American Express Card acceptance.

If you receive payments from any Card Network exceeding the threshold specified by that Card Network, you agree that (i) Paymentech shall be a third party beneficiary of all of WePay’s rights under this Agreement and (ii) this Agreement shall be deemed the Commercial Entity Agreement as described in the Card Network Rules. 

Furthermore, you must abide by the applicable Card Network Rules and ACH Rules. For example, where you accept payment cards on your website, you will display each card's logo with equal size and prominence, and you shall not display a preference for, or discriminate against, one card brand over another. If you are using the WePay subscriptions feature, you agree that it is your responsibility to comply with applicable laws, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (Regulation E), including by capturing your customers' agreement to be billed on a recurring basis.

Notwithstanding WePay's assistance in understanding the Card Network Rules and ACH Rules, you expressly acknowledge and agree that you are assuming the risk of compliance with all provisions of the Card Network Rules and ACH Rules, regardless of whether you have possession of those provisions. You agree to reimburse us and the Bank for all fines, fees, penalties, liabilities, or other charges or assessments by a Card Network, the ACH or other payment network relating to your actions or your transactions ("Payment Network Liabilities"). The Card Networks make excerpts of their respective Card Network Rules available on their websites (including [usa.visa.com](https://usa.visa.com/), [www.mastercard.com](https://www.mastercard.co.in/en-in.html), [www.americanexpress.com](http://www.americanexpress.com/) and [www.discover.com](http://www.discover.com/)). Exhibit A to this Agreement sets forth certain specific requirements of the American Express Merchant Regulations, US. We can provide you with excerpted provisions of the ACH Rules upon your request. 

9\. Your ACH Payment Authorization
----------------------------------

If you are a Merchant or if you are a Purchaser paying by bank transfer, you authorize WePay and the Bank to initiate electronic ACH debit and credit entries to each bank account that you set up on the Website and to initiate adjustments for any transactions credited or debited in error. You agree to be bound by the ACH Rules and you agree that all ACH transactions that you initiate will comply with all applicable laws. Your authorization will remain in full force and effect until you notify us that you revoke it by contacting Customer Support or by closing your Account. You understand that WePay requires a reasonable time to act on your revocation, not to exceed five (5) business days.

If you are a Merchant, you authorize WePay to instruct the Bank to hold, receive, disburse and settle funds on your behalf. Subject to this Agreement, you also authorize WePay to instruct the Bank to debit or credit any bank account or other payment instrument that you link to your Account, to initiate adjustments for any transactions credited or debited in error, as well as for chargebacks, reversals, or claims in accordance with this Agreement, the Card Network Rules and ACH Rules.

If you are a Purchaser making payment by electronic transfer of funds from your account (each, a “ACH Transaction”), you agree to the following terms of this Agreement. You authorize WePay to electronically debit your designated account (and, if necessary, electronically credit your account to correct erroneous debits) for all ACH Transactions that you initiate for the designated amount on the designated date of such ACH Transaction as set forth on your receipt. You understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you notify the Platform or WePay customer support in writing that you wish to revoke this authorization. If you are a Purchaser paying by credit card and your credit card account number changes or your credit card expiration date changes, we may acquire that information from our financial service providers and update your Account.

WePay may use Plaid, Inc. ("Plaid") to gather your data from financial institutions. When you set up a bank account on the Website and input your online banking credentials for instant verification, you are granting Plaid the right, power and authority to access and transmit your personal and financial information from your financial institution. You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored, and processed by Plaid in accordance with the [Plaid Privacy Policy.](https://plaid.com/legal/)

10\. Accepted Forms of Payment
------------------------------

The Service supports most domestic and international credit, debit, prepaid or gift cards with a Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover logo. We may add or remove support for certain payment cards at any time without prior notice. We may elect only to process cards that receive an authorization from the applicable issuer. You agree to accept all of the cards issued by Card Networks that the Service supports in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

The Service also supports payments via ACH from U.S.-based Purchasers with a U.S. bank account to U.S.-based Merchants, if supported by the Platform. We may conduct verification checks on Purchasers to ensure account ownership and sufficient balance, and we may refuse to process payments from Purchasers at our discretion.

The Service supports payments via Apple Pay to Merchants in the U.S., if supported by the Platform. The [Apple Pay Web Merchant Terms and Conditions](https://developer.apple.com/terms/apple-pay-web/) apply, and Merchant agrees to be bound by them.

11\. Sharing Information
------------------------

We may share some or all of the information about you and your transactions with the Bank, the Card Networks, and our other service providers (and their respective affiliates, agents, subcontractors, and employees), who may use this information to perform their obligations under their agreements with WePay, to operate and promote their respective networks, to perform analytics and create reports, to prevent fraud, and for any other lawful purpose. American Express and other Card Networks may use your name, address, and website address (URL) in any media from time to time. At any time, WePay, the Bank, the Card Networks or our other service providers may conclude that you will not be permitted to use the Service.

You agree that WePay is permitted to contact and share information about you and your Account with the Bank, the Card Networks, other financial institutions, and government agencies. This includes sharing information (a) about your transactions for regulatory or compliance purposes, (b) for use in connection with the management and maintenance of the Service, (c) to create and update their customer records about you and to assist them in better serving you, (d) for use in connection with their agreement with us, to operate and promote their business, perform analytics and create reports, and for any other lawful business purpose, and (e) to conduct risk management.

12\. Settlement Schedule
------------------------

WePay will instruct the Bank to settle funds to the Merchant's bank account or other payment instrument according to the schedule the Merchant selects (daily, weekly, or monthly). Merchants may request ad-hoc settlement at any time. If the Bank cannot transfer the funds to the Merchant's bank account or other payment instrument (due to inaccurate or obsolete bank account information entered by the Merchant, or for any other reason), WePay may instruct the Bank to refund the funds to the Purchaser or escheat them pursuant to Section 22 below. Neither the Bank, WePay, Platform, nor the Purchaser will have any liability to Merchant for funds so refunded or escheated.

Settlements to a bank account or other payment instrument may be limited or delayed based on your perceived risk and history with WePay. Should WePay, the Bank or the Platform need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your Account, WePay may instruct the Bank to defer settlement or restrict access to your funds for the entire time it takes us to do so. The Bank may also defer settlement or restrict access to your funds as required by law or court order, or if otherwise requested by law enforcement or governmental entity. WePay or the Platform may respond to and comply with any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant, or other legal order ("Legal Order"). WePay or the Platform may instruct the Bank to deliver or hold any funds or any information as required under such Legal Order. Neither WePay, the Bank nor the Platform is responsible for any losses that you may incur as a result of our response or compliance with a Legal Order.

Furthermore, if WePay, Platform or the Bank suspects future chargebacks or disputes as a result of transactions to your Account, WePay may instruct the Bank to defer settlement and/or restrict access to your funds until WePay, Platform and the Bank reasonably believe, in their respective sole discretion, that the risk of receiving a chargeback or dispute has passed. All settlements to Merchants are subject to review for risk and compliance purposes and can be delayed or postponed at WePay's, Platform's or the Bank's respective sole discretion. The bank account or other payment instrument linked to your Account will remain open while you use the Service and for at least 180 days afterwards (or longer as we may request). During this time, you will ensure that we are permitted to initiate debit and credit entries to or from your bank account or other payment instrument.

If you link your Account to a Chase bank account, then we may assign and transfer your Account information and documentation to a replacement Chase bank account at our discretion. We may make this assignment when your Chase bank account is reported compromised by you or any person authorized to access your Chase bank account on your behalf. If Chase issues you a replacement Chase bank account, then this Agreement governing you and your Account will continue to apply, without interruption, as if you retained the discontinued Chase bank account.

13\. Reserve
------------

At any time and from time to time, WePay may instruct the Bank to temporarily suspend or delay payments to you and/or require a "Reserve" (defined following) to protect WePay and the Bank against the risks from you using the Service, including chargebacks, refunds, and Payment Network Liabilities. A "Reserve" is funds the Bank may withhold from you or require you to pay or obtain from any bank account or other funding source associated with any Account you hold with WePay and which the Bank maintains to protect WePay and the Bank against a risk that we or the Bank reasonably anticipate. We or the Platform will notify you of the amount of any required Reserve, which we and the Bank will determine in good faith. WePay may (but is not required to) apply funds in the Reserve toward, and set off any funds that would otherwise be payable to WePay to you against, the satisfaction of any amounts due from you pursuant to this Agreement. The Bank will hold and control any required Reserve. The Reserve will not bear interest, and the Bank can commingle the Reserve with other funds. You have no interest in any Reserve other than a contingent right to receive any unused funds. WePay may periodically instruct the Bank to increase your required Reserve, or return Reserve funds no longer needed to manage your risk. When we and the Bank decide a Reserve is no longer needed, the Bank will return all unused Reserve funds to you. The right to require a Reserve will survive termination of this Agreement. This means that this Section 13 will remain in force even if you or we terminate the Agreement.

14\. Accounts
-------------

You are not required to have funds in your Account in order to use the Service. Any funds in your Account will be co-mingled and held by the Bank with other Merchants' funds in one or more pooled accounts at the Bank that are established in the Bank's name for the benefit of you and other users. The Bank has sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any pooled account. 

As consideration for using the Service, you irrevocably assign to us or the Bank all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings or benefits that may accrue or are attributable to the Bank holding your funds in a pooled account.

If your Account is negative for an extended period of time (as defined by WePay in its sole discretion), the Bank may close your Account, and we may pursue legal action or other collection efforts.

15\. Cardholder Data Security
-----------------------------

"Cardholder Data" is information associated with a payment card, such as account number, expiration date, and CVV2. WePay will comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI DSS") to the extent WePay possesses or otherwise stores, processes, or transmits Cardholder Data on your behalf, or to the extent WePay could impact the security of your Cardholder Data environment. WePay is a validated PCI Level 1 Service Provider and so is qualified to handle Cardholder Data in connection with the Service.

If you handle, transmit, or store any Cardholder Data in connection with your use of the Service or the WePay API, you agree to comply at all times with PCI DSS. Further, you agree to certify such compliance and provide documentation in accordance with Card Network Rules, or when asked by WePay to do so. You also agree that you will use only PCI DSS compliant service providers in connection with the storage, processing, or transmission of Cardholder Data.

You are fully responsible for the security of data (including but not limited to Cardholder Data) on your website or otherwise in your possession or control. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, Card Network Rules and ACH Rules in connection with your collection, security and dissemination of any personal, financial, or transaction information.

16\. Taxes
----------

You are responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed, incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld, in connection with your use of the Service. You are solely responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting and remitting any taxes to the appropriate tax authority. WePay is not obligated to, and will not, determine whether taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report or remit any taxes to any tax authority arising from your use of the Service.

WePay or the Bank may have tax reporting responsibilities in connection with the Service. For example, WePay or the Bank will report to the Internal Revenue Service, state and/or local governments on Form 1099 as required by law, your name, address, Tax Identification Number (Employment Identification Number or Social Security Number), the total gross dollar amount of the payments you process in a calendar year, and the total gross dollar amount of the payments you process for each month in a calendar year.

17\. Customer Service Provided by Merchants
-------------------------------------------

You are solely responsible for all customer service issues relating to your goods or services, including pricing, order fulfillment, order cancellation by you or the Purchaser, returns, refunds and adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, technical support and feedback concerning experiences with your personnel, policies or processes. In performing customer service, you will always present yourself as a separate entity from WePay. Merchants and Platforms will cooperate with WePay to assure that Purchasers have access to clear customer service information, including an active customer service email address and telephone number.

18\. Refunds and Returns Provided by Merchants
----------------------------------------------

You agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for goods or services through your Account in accordance with this Agreement, the Card Network Rules and the ACH Rules. The Card Network Rules require that you will (a) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy, (b) disclose your return or cancellation policy to Purchasers at the time of purchase, (c) not give cash refunds to a Purchaser in connection with a payment card sale, unless required by law, and (d) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a payment card sale refund. Your refund policies must be the same for all payment methods. If your Purchaser is dissatisfied with your refund policy, the Purchaser may chargeback the payment.

19\. Merchant's Liability for Chargebacks
-----------------------------------------

The amount of a payment may be charged back to you if (a) it is disputed by a Purchaser, (b) it is reversed for any reason, (c) it was not authorized or we have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or (d) it is unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of the terms of this Agreement. You are responsible for all chargebacks, whether or not the chargeback complies with the Card Network Rules. You are also responsible if a Purchaser reverses a payment by bank transfer, whether or not the reversal complies with the ACH Rules.

20\. How WePay and the Platform Handle Chargebacks
--------------------------------------------------

You owe the Bank and will immediately pay the amount of any chargeback or ACH reversal and any associated fees, fines, or penalties assessed by the Bank, the Card Networks or the ACH. If you do not have sufficient funds in your Account, we and the Bank will have the remedies set forth below in Section 21, Set-off and Collection Rights; Grant of Security Interest. If you have pending chargebacks or reversals, the Bank may delay settlement to you.

Further, if we reasonably believe that a chargeback or reversal is likely with respect to any transaction, the Bank may withhold the amount of the potential chargeback or reversal from payments otherwise due to you under this Agreement until such time that: (a) a chargeback or reversal is assessed due to a Purchaser's complaint, in which case the Bank will retain and refund the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the Purchaser may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a chargeback or reversal on the transaction will not occur.

If we determine that you are incurring an excessive amount of chargebacks or reversals, WePay or the Bank may establish controls or conditions governing your Account, including without limitation, by (a) assessing additional fees, (b) creating a Reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated chargebacks, reversals and related fees, (c) delaying settlement, and (d) terminating or suspending the Service or closing your Account.

You agree to assist us and the Platform when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Service. To that end, you permit us and the Platform to share information about a chargeback or reversal with the Purchaser, the Purchaser's financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a chargeback or reversal. We or the Platform will request necessary information from you to contest the chargeback or reversal. If the chargeback or reversal is contested successfully, the Bank will release the reserved funds to you. If a chargeback or reversal dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Card Networks, ACH or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the chargeback or reversal, the Bank may recover the chargeback or reversal amount and any associated fees as described in this Agreement. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us and the Platform in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within seven (7) days of a request, may result in an irreversible chargeback or reversal. We and the Platform reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating chargeback and reversal disputes.  

21\. Collection Rights
----------------------

In addition to any other rights and remedies WePay may have under this Agreement, WePay may pursue one or more of the following options with respect to amounts due under this Agreement: (a) withhold all or some of your settlement funds (or any other funds that would otherwise be payable by WePay to you) and apply them against the amounts due; (b) debit the bank account or other payment instrument linked to your Account for the amounts due; (c) request and receive prompt payment for such amounts; and (d) apply funds held in any existing Reserve against the amounts due. Your failure to pay in full amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of this Agreement. You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and interest at the lesser of one-and-one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month or the highest rate permitted by law. In its discretion, WePay or the Platform may make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities and cooperate with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution. You hereby expressly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts will be made by email, by text or by phone, as provided by you to WePay or the Platform. Such communication may be made by WePay or by anyone on its behalf, including but not limited to the Platform or a third party collection agent.

22\. Dormant Accounts
---------------------

If there is no activity in your Account (such as a payment or settlement) for the period of time set forth in the applicable unclaimed property laws, and you have funds, we or the Platform may notify you by sending an email to your registered email address or a text to your registered telephone number. We or the Platform may also notify you by U.S. mail. If you do not initiate settlement of the funds or respond to the notice within the time period specified in the notice, we may close your Account and escheat your funds (less a processing fee) in accordance with applicable law.

23\. Statements and Errors
--------------------------

WePay or the Platform will provide a report of activities, including transactions and fees, relating to the Service ("Statement"), which is available for you to examine when it is available online. Neither WePay nor the Platform is responsible for you relying on balance, transaction or related information that is updated or corrected, or the accuracy or timeliness of information supplied by any third party. You agree that the Statements are sufficient for you to inspect and review activity and to identify errors and unauthorized or altered transactions. You will promptly examine your entire Statement once it is available. You will promptly, and no later than 60 calendar days after the Statement date, reconcile your Statement with your bank statements and other receipts from the same period, and notify WePay or the Platform of any: (a) unauthorized transactions, including any claims of such activity or requested adjustments, (b) alterations, errors, discrepancies and irregularities, or (c) discrepancies you identify when reconciling with your bank statements and other receipts. If you do not act in the timeframes above, you agree that you cannot: (i) assert you exercised reasonable care and promptness in reviewing your Statement and identifying errors, (ii) be reimbursed for a "Claim" (as defined in Section 34 below) refused as a result, and (iii) make a Claim or otherwise act against us for a subsequent loss that was preventable or caused by the same wrongdoer's repeated act. You should make archival copies of your Statement data regularly. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for (a) compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data, and (b) reconciling all transaction information that is associated with your Account.

The Service is not a real-time system. You acknowledge that there may be a lag in the information presented depending on when the data was last refreshed and/or the connection status. We make no commitment that the Service, or the access thereof, will be uninterrupted, available at all times, or error-free.

24\. Privacy
------------

Your privacy is very important to us. By accepting this Agreement, you confirm that you have read, understood and accepted our [Privacy Policy.](https://go.wepay.com/privacy-policy/)

25\. Security
-------------

We have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. 

If you discover a security-related issue, including any unauthorized use of your access credentials or Account, you will inform us of the issue immediately by contacting the WePay Security Team at [security@wepay.com](mailto:security@wepay.com) and the Platform. You also agree not to disclose the issue to third parties until WePay and the Platform have addressed it unless otherwise required by law.

26\. Your Right to Terminate
----------------------------

You may terminate this Agreement by closing your Account at any time. When you close your Account, any pending transactions will be cancelled. Any funds that the Bank holds for you at the time of closing, less any applicable fees and other liabilities, will be settled to you in accordance with Section 12, Settlement Schedule, and Section 13 Reserve, above.

27\. Our Right to Terminate
---------------------------

We or the Platform may terminate this Agreement and close your Account for any reason or no reason at any time upon notice to you. We or the Platform may also suspend the Service and instruct the Bank to suspend access to your Account (including the funds in your Account) if you (a) have violated the terms of WePay's policies, Platform's policies, or this Agreement, (b) pose an unacceptable credit or fraud risk, or (c) provide any false, incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading information or otherwise engage in fraudulent or illegal conduct.

28\. Effect of Termination
--------------------------

If your Account is terminated for any reason or no reason, you agree: (a) to continue to be bound by this Agreement, (b) to immediately stop using the Service, (c) that the license provided under this Agreement shall end, (d) that we and the Platform have the right to delete all of your information and Account data in accordance with our record-keeping policies and applicable law, and (e) that neither WePay nor the Platform shall be liable to you or any third party for any of the foregoing actions. Neither WePay nor the Platform will be liable to you for compensation, reimbursement, or damages in connection with any termination or suspension of Service. Any termination of this Agreement does not relieve you of any obligations to pay any fees or costs accrued prior to the termination and any other amounts owed by you to us or the Platform as provided in this Agreement. After termination of this Agreement, you continue to be liable for all chargebacks, refunds, fees, Payment Network Liabilities, and adjustment resulting from or relating to transactions processed pursuant to this Agreement. If you submit transactions to us after the date of termination, we may, but are not required to, process such transactions. All transactions we process will be in accordance with and subject to all the terms of this Agreement. This Section 28 will survive termination of this Agreement.

29\. Our Intellectual Property Rights
-------------------------------------

WePay grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense, to electronically access and use the Service solely to accept and receive payments and to manage the funds you so receive.

Unless you separately execute a written agreement with WePay that expressly grants you such permission, you may not, nor may you permit any third party to, do any of the following: (i) access or monitor any material or information on any WePay system using any manual process or robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means; (ii) copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, publicly display, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell or distribute in any way material or information from WePay; (iii) permit any third party to use and benefit from the Service via a rental, lease, timesharing, service bureau or other arrangement; (iv) transfer any rights granted to you under this Agreement; (v) violate the restrictions in any robot exclusion headers on the Service, work around, bypass, or circumvent any of the technical limitations of the Service, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise disabled in the Service, or decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Service, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (vi) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the proper working of the Service, prevent access to or use of the Service by our other users, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; or (vii) otherwise use the Service except as expressly allowed under this Agreement. You may not use the Service on a mobile device that is "jail broken" or otherwise modified contrary to the manufacturer's software or hardware guidelines. Your use of the Service may be subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer and your carrier.

Under no circumstances will our and the Bank’s financial liabilities arising out of or related to this Agreement exceed the total fees paid to us under this Agreement (net of Card Network and other third party fees such as interchange, assessments, and Payment Network Liabilities) for the six months prior to the time the liability arose.  
  
WePay and the Bank are only liable for reasonably foreseeable damages directly caused by an act that is within our or the Bank’s respective direct control and are not responsible for your actions, inactions, omissions, delays or failures, or those of third parties.

-----------------------------------------

You agree to unconditionally release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, the Bank and our respective Related Persons (defined following) for any Claim arising from or related to: (a) us or the Bank providing the Service, or accepting or processing a transaction or instruction from you, your authorized person or on your behalf related to the Service or otherwise consistent with this Agreement, (b) us or the Bank paying a tax, interest or penalty for which you are liable or for which we or the Bank otherwise have no responsibility, (c) us or the Bank taking any action permitted by this Agreement, including defending against a Claim, (d) you breaching this Agreement or a representation or warranty you give, (e) you claiming against a Card Network or payment network relating to the Service or a transaction, (f) you, us or the Bank incurring fees, fines or penalties arising from you breaching legal requirements, Card Network Rules or ACH Rules, (g) you or anyone else using the Service with your access credentials, and (h) a third party claim.

Indemnity obligations in this Agreement remain in force after your Account closes or this Agreement or the Service terminates.

36\. Disputes
-------------

If a dispute of any kind arises, we want to understand and address your concerns quickly and to your satisfaction. Please contact Customer Support with any dispute. If we cannot resolve your concerns, we agree to an informal dispute resolution process requiring individual arbitration.

37\. Binding Individual Arbitration
-----------------------------------

You agree that any Claim related to this Agreement or the Service, including claims regarding the applicability of this arbitration clause, shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). We or the Bank will select another arbitration forum if the AAA ceases operations.  
  
In the absence of this arbitration clause, you may otherwise have had a right or opportunity to litigate any Claim through a court before a judge or jury and to participate or be represented in litigation filed in court by others (including class actions). You are waiving those rights and any Claim you have must now be resolved through arbitration.  
  
All Claims are subject to arbitration, no matter what theory they are based on. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other source of law.  
  
Claims and remedies sought as part of a class action, private attorney general, or other representative action are subject to arbitration on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis only, and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.  
  
The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be limited solely to the Claim between you, on the one hand, and us or the Bank, on the other hand. The arbitration, or any portion of it, will not be consolidated with any other arbitration and will not be conducted on a class-wide or class action basis. The prohibition against class action contained in this Section 37 shall be non-severable from the remainder of this Section 37.  
  
If either party prevails in the arbitration of any Claim against the other, the non-prevailing party will reimburse the prevailing party for any fees it paid to the AAA in connection with the arbitration, as well as for any reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such arbitration.  
  
Any decision rendered in such arbitration proceedings will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction.  
  
Rules and forms of the AAA may be obtained and Claims may be filed at any AAA office, [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), or 335 Madison Avenue, New York NY 10017, telephone 1-800-778-7879. Any arbitration hearing at which you appear will take place at a location within New York County, New York, New York.  
  
This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sections 1-16. This arbitration agreement applies to all Claims now in existence or that may arise in the future. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent any party’s use of (or advancement of any Claims, defenses, or offsets in) bankruptcy or repossession, replevin, judicial foreclosure, or any other prejudgment or provisional remedy relating to any collateral, security, or other property interests for contractual debts now or hereafter owed by either party to the other.  
  
In the event that you, the Bank or WePay are not able to resolve a dispute with American Express, or a claim against WePay, the Bank or any other entity that American Express has a right to join, Exhibit B will apply.

38\. Governing Law and Venue
----------------------------

The internal laws of the State of New York (without reference to its conflict of laws rules) apply to this Agreement, subject to any modifying "Legal Requirements," defined following. "Legal Requirements" means each applicable law, ordinance, decree, requirement, order, judgment, rule, regulation, directive, circular, interpretive letter, guidance or other official release (or a related interpretation) of a government authority or a regulatory (including self-regulatory) organization to which a party and/or its affiliates is subject, including (a) all applicable anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations, (b) "Know-Your-Customer" and sanctions laws, rules and regulations, (c) Federal Reserve Board regulations, and (d) tax regulations. All rights and remedies relating to this Agreement, Legal Requirements, the ACH Rules and the Card Network Rules are cumulative and do not exclude any other rights or remedies. The maximum amount of pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with any Claim will be the lower of the prime rate and the rate set by the State of New York.  
  
Disputes relating to the Service will be resolved by an arbitration tribunal or by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York and you agree to submit to this jurisdiction.  
  
This Section 38 does not prevent us from starting proceedings in a court or tribunal of any state with jurisdiction, including concurrently in any number of states.

39\. Waiving Rights to Jury Trial
---------------------------------

You and we waive the right to a trial by jury for any matter or Claim relating to this Agreement, the Service or a transaction.

40\. Assigning this Agreement; Change of Control
------------------------------------------------

We must agree in writing before you transfer or assign this Agreement (including by operation of law or merger). Without our consent, such transfer or assignment is void and may result in us immediately terminating the Agreement. Where we do agree, an assignee or transferee is subject to this Agreement and the obligations and liabilities you owed to us before the date it is transferred or assigned.  
  
We must agree in writing before an assignee can continue, assume or assign this Agreement for the benefit of a creditor, custodian, receive, trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, sheriff or court officer, or a person taking charge of your assets or business.  
  
We or the Bank can at any time assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, or any or all of our respective rights and obligations under this Agreement.  
  
You will give us notice at least 60 calendar days before you sell all or substantially all of your assets, or a person becomes a beneficial owner with more than 50 percent of the combined voting power of your ownership interests, or acquires voting control. You will give us information we request about a major asset sale or ownership change.

41\. Third Party Services and Links to Other Websites

We have the right to change the terms of this Agreement at any time with notice that we in our sole discretion deem to be reasonable in the circumstances, including posting the revised Agreement on our Website. Any use of the Service after such notice or posting shall constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as modified.

43\. Force Majeure

Neither we nor the Bank are liable to you for not carrying out, or delaying performance of, any actions caused by an act of God, a government authority, any Card Network, the ACH, a Legal Requirement, a catastrophe, war or terrorism, civil or labor disturbance, fire, flood, other natural disaster, or any other cause beyond our reasonable control.

44\. Other Provisions
---------------------

Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, these terms are a complete statement of the agreement between you and WePay, and they describe the entire liability of WePay and the Bank and your exclusive remedy with respect to your access and use of the Service. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any other WePay agreement or policy, this Agreement shall prevail on the subject matter of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. Headings are included for convenience only, and shall not be considered in interpreting this Agreement. The Agreement does not limit any rights that WePay may have under trade secret, copyright, patent or other laws. WePay's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.

45\. Survival
-------------

Any provision that is reasonably necessary to accomplish or enforce the purpose of this Agreement shall survive and remain in effect in accordance with its terms upon the termination of this Agreement.

Merchant or American Express may elect to resolve any Claim by binding individual arbitration. Claims will be decided by a neutral arbitrator. If arbitration is elected by any party, neither Merchant nor WePay nor American Express will have the right to litigate or have a jury trial on that Claim in court. Further, Merchant, WePay, and American Express will not have the right to participate in a class action or in a representative capacity or in a group of persons alleged to be similarly situated pertaining to any Claim subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules in court. An arbitrator's decisions are final and binding, and the arbitrator's final decision on a Claim generally is enforceable as a court order with very limited review by a court. Other rights Merchant, WePay, or American Express would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.

1. Initiation of Arbitration. Claims may be referred to either JAMS or the AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement and the selected organization's rules in effect when the Claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Arbitration Agreement. Contact JAMS or the AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims may be referred to another arbitration organization if all parties agree in writing, if American Express selects the organization and Merchant selects the other within 30 days thereafter or if an arbitrator is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1-16 (FAA). Any arbitration hearing will take place in the federal judicial district where Merchant's headquarters is located or New York, NY, at Merchant's election.
2. Limitations on Arbitration. If any party elects to resolve a Claim by arbitration, that Claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. No Claim is to be arbitrated on a class or purported representative basis or on behalf of the general public or other persons allegedly similarly situated. The arbitrator's authority is limited to Claims between Merchant, WePay, and American Express. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case brought by Merchant, WePay or American Express and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award as between Merchant, WePay and American Express. This prohibition is intended to, and does, preclude Merchant from participating in any action by any trade association or other organization against American Express. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Arbitration Agreement, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration is found invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration Agreement (other than this sentence) will not apply, except that Merchant, WePay, and American Express do not waive the right to appeal that decision.
3. Previously Filed Claims/No Waiver. Merchant, WePay, or American Express may elect to arbitrate any Claim that has been filed in court at any time before trial has begun or final judgment has been entered on the Claim. Merchant, WePay, or American Express may choose to delay enforcing or to not exercise rights under this Arbitration Agreement, including the right to elect to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights on any other occasion. For the avoidance of any confusion, and not to limit its scope, this section applies to any class-action lawsuit relating to the "Honor All Cards," "non-discrimination," or "no steering" provisions of the American Express Merchant Regulations, or any similar provisions of any prior American Express Card acceptance agreement, that was filed against American Express prior to the Effective Date of the Arbitration Agreement to the extent that such claims are not already subject to arbitration pursuant to a prior agreement between Merchant and American Express.
4. Arbitrator's Authority. The arbitrator will have the power and authority to award any relief that would have been available in court and that is authorized under this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator has no power or authority to alter the Agreement or any of its separate provisions, including this Arbitration Agreement.
5. Split Proceedings for Equitable Relief. Merchant, WePay, or American Express may seek equitable relief in aid of arbitration prior to arbitration on the merits if necessary to preserve the status quo pending completion of the arbitration. This section shall be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement is entitled to seek an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.
6. Small Claims. American Express will not elect arbitration for any Claim Merchant properly files in a small claims court so long as the Claim seeks individual relief only and is pending only in that court.
7. Governing Law/Arbitration Procedures/Entry of Judgment. This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator shall apply New York law and applicable statutes of limitations and honor claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall apply the rules of the arbitration organization selected, as applicable to matters relating to evidence and discovery, not federal or any state rules of procedure or evidence, provided that any party may ask the arbitrator to expand discovery by making a written request, to which the other parties will have 15 days to respond before the arbitrator rules on the request. If Merchant's Claim is for $10,000 or less, Merchant may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the rules of the selected arbitration organization. At the timely request of a party, the arbitrator will provide a written opinion explaining his/her award. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, except for any rights of appeal provided by the FAA. Judgment on an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any state or federal court in the federal judicial district where Merchant's headquarters or Merchant's assets are located.
8. Confidentiality. The arbitration proceeding and all information submitted, relating to or presented in connection with or during the proceeding, shall be deemed confidential information not to be disclosed to any person not a party to the arbitration. All communications, whether written or oral, made in the course of or in connection with the Claim and its resolution, by or on behalf of any party or by the arbitrator or a mediator, including any arbitration award or judgment related thereto, are confidential and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment or estoppel, in any other litigation or proceeding; provided, however, that evidence shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable solely as a result of its use in the arbitration.
9. Costs of Arbitration Proceedings. Merchant will be responsible for paying Merchant's share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees Merchant would have incurred if Merchant had brought a claim in court. American Express will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At Merchant's written request, American Express will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of Merchant's share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.
10. Additional Arbitration Awards. If the arbitrator rules in Merchant's favor against American Express for an amount greater than any final settlement offer American Express made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include: (1) any money to which Merchant is entitled as determined by the arbitrator, but in no case less than $5,000; and (2) any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expert and other witness fees incurred by Merchant.
11. Definitions. For purposes of this Exhibit B, "Arbitration Agreement (as to Claims involving American Express) (U.S.)" only, (i) American Express includes its affiliates, licensees, predecessors, successors, or assigns, any purchasers of any receivables, and all agents, directors, and representatives of any of the foregoing, (ii) Merchant includes Merchant's affiliates, licensees, predecessors, successors, or assigns, any purchasers of any receivables and all agents, directors, and representatives of any of the foregoing, and (iii) Claim means any allegation of an entitlement to relief, whether damages, injunctive or any other form of relief, against American Express or against WePay or any other entity that American Express has the right to join, including, a transaction using an American Express product or network or regarding an American Express policy or procedure.
