Terms of Use
============

Last updated November 1, 2022

Charity Navigator, Inc., a 501(c)(3) public charity (hereinafter, "Charity Navigator," "we," "us," or "our") welcomes you. We invite you to access and use our online services  ("Services"), which are made available to you through the Charity Navigator website, [www.charitynavigator.org](https://www.charitynavigator.org/), (the “Website”) and related applications and platforms, including the Nonprofit Portal (together, our “Platform”).  
  

We provide our Services to Visitors and Registered Users (as defined below) subject to these Terms of Use, which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. The Terms of Use are a contract between you and Charity Navigator. Your access to and continued use of certain areas within the Website located at https://charitynavigator.org (including any successor sites), including any portions of the Website that require registration, constitutes your reading, understanding and acceptance, without limitation, of the terms and conditions of the Terms of Use.

If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the Services.  
  

1. **Description and Use of Services**  
      
    Charity Navigator helps donors make informed giving decisions and enables charities to demonstrate their commitment to proper stewardship by, among other things, evaluating and publishing financial ratings of charities through a searchable database of information that Charity Navigator has collected, compiled, and assembled about Section 501(c)(3) organizations ("Charity Navigator Database").  We also facilitate contributions from donors to their selected charities through the “Giving Basket” functionality.  
      
    When we use the terms “you” or “your” in these Terms of Use, we are referring to individuals who use our Services, such as:  
      
    
    * Visitors,
    * Registered Users
    * Charity Representative Users
    
      
    Visitors.  Visitors, as the term implies, are people who don't register with us, but want to view various webpages and see what the Services are all about. No login is required for Visitors.

    Registered Users.  Login is required for all Registered Users, who are able to access and utilize the same functions as Visitors, and: (a) flag charities of interest in their own charity "portfolio"; (b) update their accounts; and (c) sign up for Charity Navigator's newsletter, alerts, and other notifications.  
      
    Charities and Charity Representative Users.  Charities may also register to use the Platform and to provide information to enhance such charity’s profile.  In order to register, a charity must designate one or more official representatives to manage its Charity Navigator profile (each, a “Charity Representative User”).  Charity Representative Users are able to: (a) update basic information about the applicable charity; (b) provide and/or update their data for evaluation by Charity Navigator to produce ratings and for other its other business purposes; and (c) dialogue with Charity Navigator on the applicable charity’s behalf.   
      
    
    For purposes of the Agreement, unless otherwise herein stated, the term "Registered User" shall include both charities that register with us as well as their Charity Representative Users.  Charity and Charity Representative Users are also subject to [additional terms and conditions](https://www.charitynavigator.org/about-us/financials-and-policies/terms-and-conditions-nonprofit-portal.html) that apply specifically to them.    
      
    Charity Navigator is under no obligation to accept any charity or individual as a Registered User and may accept or reject any registration in its sole and complete discretion. In addition, Charity Navigator may deactivate any account at any time, including, without limitation, if it determines that a Registered User has violated the Agreement.
