(“we” or “us”). The Apps and the Site are referred to together as the “Service”. “You” refers to any user of the Service.

**INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS  
**Personal Information may be transferred to and maintained on computers and servers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside of the United States, please note that data we collect about you may be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States unless otherwise noted. If you reside in the UK or the EU, please note that some of our service providers may be located outside the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). In such cases we will transfer your data only to such countries as approved by the European Commission as providing adequate level of data protection, or enter into legal agreements ensuring an adequate level of data protection in accordance with the instructions of the EU commission as updated from time to time.

We may transfer our databases containing your Personal Information in connection with the transfer or sale of all (or substantially all) of our business assets, or in the event of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction.

**USER RIGHTS  
**We acknowledge that different people have different privacy concerns and preferences. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. We allow you to exercise certain choices, rights, and controls in connection with your information. Depending on your relationship with us, your jurisdiction and the applicable data protection laws that apply to you, you have the right to control and request certain limitations or rights to be executed.

The following table describes all the rights you are entitled to. Please note that some rights are only available for residents of California, Virginia, or the European Union.

We comply with applicable laws and respect the privacy rights of our users. If you wish to exercise any of your rights, or ask us a question, please contact us by using the contact details provided below. However, please note that these rights are not absolute, and may be subject to our own legitimate interests and regulatory requirements.

**LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES OR APPS  
**Our Service may link to or refer to third party websites or services that we do not own or control. Any Personal Information you provide is provided directly to such third party and is subject to such third party’s provider’s privacy policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such other websites or services, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any websites or services not controlled by us, nor are we responsible for such third party’s use or misuse of your Personal Information. If you have any concerns, we urge you to review the terms of those other websites or services for more information about their applicable policies.

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION  
**We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of your Personal Information. Your information is stored on secure servers and isn’t publicly available. We limit access of your information only to those employees or partners that need to know the information in order to enable the carrying out of the agreement between us.

While we seek to protect your information to ensure that it is kept confidential, no security system is infallible and impervious, and we cannot absolutely guarantee its security. You should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the internet. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of your Personal Information or other content you transmit using the Service, and you do so at your own risk.

You need to help us prevent unauthorized access to your account by protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your account (for example, by signing off after you have finished accessing your account). You will be solely responsible for keeping your password confidential and for all use of your password and your account, including any unauthorized use.

Under no circumstances should the Service be used by persons under the Age of Majority. We will not knowingly collect Personal Information from any person under the Age of Majority unless as described herein, and at our sole discretion. If you discover that a child has been using the Service without your consent, or that someone has been using the Service for or on behalf of your child without your consent, please contact us using the information below under “How to Contact Us” and we will take reasonable steps to delete the child’s information from our active databases. Medisafe reserves the right to check its user base from time to time and remove users whom Medisafe has grounds to believe they are in fact minors, including without limitation, restricting those user accounts, or deleting them, as Medisafe may deem appropriate.
