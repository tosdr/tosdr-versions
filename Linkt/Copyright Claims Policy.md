Transurban Hardship Policy
==========================

Last updated 12 July 2024 | Print as PDF

* * *

1\. Introduction
----------------

This Hardship Policy outlines the commitment of Transurban and its Subsidiaries, including those operating under the brand “Linkt”, to identify and assist people who want to, but are unable to pay their toll debt because of circumstances beyond their control ("hardship") through our dedicated hardship team Linkt Assist (“Linkt Assist”, “us” or “we”).

We recognise that many social or financial factors such as illness, disability, unemployment, drug or alcohol dependence, family violence or related factors can cause hardship. In particular, we recognise that family violence can be especially complex because of the circumstances and the possible risks to a person’s safety.

This policy sets out how we identify and assist people who are experiencing social and financial hardship. Our goal is to provide the highest level of service and to treat people individually, sensitively and with respect.

 [Back to top](#jumpto)

2\. Who this hardship policy is for
-----------------------------------

This policy applies to people in Australia who use our roads, whether or not they have a customer account with us ("Customers"). This policy may be extended to small business owners on a case-by-case basis by Linkt Assist. It does not apply to commercial customers, or drivers who pass on the cost of their tolls to their passengers. 

While commercial customers do not meet the criteria for support under this Hardship policy, Linkt may be able to provide support to commercial customers experiencing difficulty paying with a range of support options. Each circumstance will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Follow our steps on How to Apply for Help below, and we will take care of the rest.

 [Back to top](#jumpto)

3\. Identifying hardship
------------------------

The first step is for a customer to discuss their situation with us. We encourage customers to contact us and let us know if they are experiencing difficulty paying their tolls. We understand some people may be uncomfortable talking about their situation, but we will listen without judgement and with empathy.

For details on how to get in touch, see section [How to Apply for Help](#apply).  

 [Back to top](#jumpto)

4\. What we can do
------------------

Our dedicated team of Linkt Assist specialists will assess each customer situation on a case-by-case basis and work with customers to provide assistance tailored to their circumstances.

If a customer is a client of a registered financial counsellor, community or legal aid lawyer, or community welfare practitioner, we will accept their professional assessment and work with any information they give us.

We will work with eligible customers to help match their use of our roads with what they can afford to pay. We know that mobility is essential, and restrictions on mobility when experiencing hardship may only make things worse.

 [Back to top](#jumpto)

5\. Examples of the help we can give include  

-----------------------------------------------

1. extending timeframes to pay
2. establishing a regular payment plan
3. granting a payment free period
4. writing off some or all of the debt owed to us
5. advocating for the recall of a toll infringement
6. providing [toll credit support](https://www.linkt.com.au/linkt-assist/before-you-apply.html) for essential toll road travel (for active Linkt accounts only)
7. Referral for additional external support through established partnerships:
    1. Linkt Assist 360 via Good Shepherd 
    2. The One Stop, One Story Hub via Thriving Communities Partnership

6\. How to apply for help
-------------------------

Customers wanting help can contact us by telephone on [1300 767 865](tel:1300767865) or write to us at [linktassist@transurban.com](mailto:linktassist@transurban.com). They can also contact us online at [www.linkt.com.au/assist](https://www.linkt.com.au/linkt-assist.html "Linkt Assist can support you when times are tough").

We will need to record, use and if necessary, share a customer’s personal information to assess their situation and eligibility for hardship assistance. We will seek a customer’s consent before collecting, using or sharing their personal information. We may also ask for supporting documents such as statements of current income, expenses, assets, liabilities or other documents to support their situation. Find out more by reading the [Linkt Assist privacy collection statement](https://www.linkt.com.au/legal/policies/linkt-assist-privacy-collection-statement/brisbane.html) and [Transurban Privacy Policy](https://www.linkt.com.au/legal/policies/transurban-privacy-policy/brisbane.html "Read Transurban's Privacy Policy here").

7\. Financial Counselling can help
----------------------------------

Financial counsellors can help people manage their finances more effectively and, if authorised to do so, can represent a customer in discussions with us. Where we can, we will refer customers, with their consent, to accredited financial counselling agencies who offer their help at no cost to the customer.

 [Back to top](#jumpto)

8\. Privacy
-----------

If a customer contacts Linkt Assist seeking assistance to pay for their tolls, we may collect information about their personal circumstances to assess their eligibility for hardship assistance under this Hardship Policy. We may collect this information from them or from an authorised representative who has been provided consent to contact us to act on their behalf. The information we may collect from a customer or their authorised representative may include information about the customer’s financial and personal circumstances or specialist support they are receiving such as financial counselling, welfare assistance or hardship/relief aid. If a third party authorised to act on our behalf identifies that a customer of ours may be experiencing financial hardship and may be eligible for hardship assistance under this Policy, they may provide the customer’s information to us with the customer’s consent to assist with referrals for support. 

We collect this information about customers in order to assess their personal circumstances and determine the extent of their eligibility under this Hardship Policy. This information is used to appropriately implement the outcome of how we can provide hardship assistance, such as setting up a payment plan or giving more time to pay. We will not disclose a customer’s information to third parties without their consent.

If a customer or an authorised representative would like further information regarding how we will use, disclose and secure their personal information, or to understand how to access their personal information held by us (including sensitive information), please refer to the [Linkt Assist privacy collection statement](https://www.linkt.com.au/legal/policies/linkt-assist-privacy-collection-statement/brisbane.html) and the [Transurban Privacy Policy](https://www.linkt.com.au/legal/policies/transurban-privacy-policy/brisbane.html).

If a customer or an authorised representative wants to talk to us about privacy, please contact the Transurban Privacy officer by e-mail on [privacy@transurban.com](mailto:privacy@transurban.com). We are happy to discuss how we handle their personal information, how your personal information is collected or any other aspect of our Privacy Policy.
