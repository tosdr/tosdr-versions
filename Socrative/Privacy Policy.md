Privacy Policy
==============

**Who Are We?**
---------------

We are Showbie Inc., the provider of Socrative. Our head office is located at #1400, 10117 Jasper Avenue NW, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T5J 1W8.

Socrative is a web-based and tablet app that can be used by teachers to assess student understanding in real-time through activities such as quizzes and polls. There are free and paid versions.

Showbie is a Data Controller with respect to Personal Data which we collect and process for our own purposes in order to provide our products and services to customers. Showbie is a Data Processor when processing Personal Data on behalf of our customers, for example, schools, teachers etc.

**Our Privacy Pledge**
----------------------

Showbie Inc. (‚Äú**Showbie**‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù) provides certain services including the Socrative application (the ‚Äú**Application**‚Äù) and related software services as more particularly described in our Terms of Use (‚Äú**Services**‚Äù). Your trust is key to the success of our business. We take privacy and confidentiality very seriously and safeguard the Personal Data of our users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy discusses the high degree of importance that we place on your privacy, including how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Data as well as the rules and conditions related to privacy of information while using our Services.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control. Our customers are responsible for maintaining their own privacy policies governing their collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Data and are responsible for ensuring that they have obtained the necessary authorizations and consents for any Personal Data made available to us for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

This Policy sets out the basis on which any Personal Data we collect from you, or from others, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your Personal Data and how we will treat it.

**Details of Personal Data Processing**
---------------------------------------

In the course of our business, we collect and process the Personal Data as set out in this Policy. This may include data we receive directly from a Data Subject (for example, by completing forms or by corresponding with us by mail, phone, email, or otherwise) and data we receive from other sources (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, credit reference agencies, government bodies, and others).

We will only process Personal Data for the specific purposes set out in this Policy or for any other purposes specifically permitted by the applicable law. We will notify those purposes to the Data Subject when we first collect the data or as soon as possible thereafter.

You may give us Personal Data where you are a user of our Services, a teacher, school or other third party interacting with us. We use your Personal Data for the following purposes:

* To provide and maintain our Application and Services
* To notify you about changes to our Application and Services
* To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Application and Services when you choose to do so
* To provide customer support
* To gather analysis or information so that we can improve our Application and Services
* To monitor the usage of our Application and Services to detect, prevent, and address security issues

### **Further details of the Personal Data we collect, details of the processing activity, and the lawful basis for each is as follows:**

When you become our customer the processing of your information, and/or that of your team who you nominate to liaise with us, will become a condition of the contract between us as we require certain information in order to be able to provide you with our services (e.g. contact information). In those circumstances, if you do not provide your information when requested, we may be unable to provide our Services to you.

### **Representatives of customers (schools, districts, businesses, etc.):**

We require the following information to set up your accounts: first name, last name, email address, phone number (optional), country, and school name. We use this data to set you up as a customer on our systems and to liaise with you and your teachers about projects that we are undertaking with you. We also process payment information to facilitate payment of our Services; for internal and external auditing and to make appropriate financial returns to revenue; to process payment of invoices etc. Our payment system also collects the IP address of users who pay online to facilitate credit card location verification.

We collect, use and disclose your Personal Data to provide the Services to you via the Application, and to administer your account in accordance with: (a) this Policy, (b) any other agreement you may have entered into with us, and (c) applicable laws and regulations. It is your responsibility to ensure that we are kept informed of the correct and current contact information for you.

The lawful basis for this processing is the agreement you have agreed to, or if you have not entered into an agreement with us, our legitimate interests in providing the Application and Services through our agreement with the customer.

When corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise, we ask you to disclose only as much information as is necessary to provide you with our Services or to submit a question/suggestion/comment in relation to our Services or products.

The lawful basis for this activity is our agreement with your or our legitimate interests in providing our Application and Services in addition to our legitimate interests in improving our Application and Services based on your question/suggestion/comment.

### **If you are a Teacher/Administrator:**

We collect and process your first name, last name, email address, phone number (optional), country, school name, school type, user ID, password, activity within the service. We also process payment information to facilitate payment of our Services; for internal and external auditing and to make appropriate financial returns to revenue; to process payment of invoices etc. Our payment system also collects the IP address of users who pay online to facilitate credit card location verification.

When corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise, we ask you to disclose only as much information as is necessary to provide you with our Services or to submit a question/suggestion/comment in relation to our Services or products. Users can log in to our Services directly using the Socrative app/web page or by using certain specified third-party accounts such as Google and MasteryConnect. We may add other third-party sign-on functionality in the future. By signing on in using a third-party account, we use your name, profile picture (if available), and email address to authenticate your identity and to pre-populate your profile.

Some third-party services, such as Google, give you the option to post or share information about your use of the services to your third-party account. The settings for that kind of sharing are outside of our Services. It‚Äôs up to you to check the sharing and privacy settings on any third-party accounts.

The lawful basis for this processing is the Terms of Use you have agreed to, or our legitimate interest in facilitating the provision of the Applications and Services to our customers, including processing payment.

If you input the Personal Data of others into the application, you are responsible for ensuring that you have obtained any permissions or authorizations for any Personal Data of others that you input or send through the Application.

We will communicate with you regarding our Services and your account. We will do this via the internet and via the email address you have provided. You acknowledge that data and information transmitted over the internet is susceptible to error or security breaches.

The lawful basis for this activity is the agreement you have entered into or our legitimate interests in providing you with important information about the Services and your account.

Showbie makes available certain AI-features which gives you the possibility to generate quiz content (quiz name, questions, and answers), based on prompts provided by you. Any generated content must be approved by you before it may become visible to students. These AI features are based on services from third party general purpose AI providers. By using the features, limited personal data concerning your use of the Services and your account will be processed. The AI features will not be used for grading student work, and only limited, anonymized student data will be processed by using the features. The lawful basis for our provision of the AI services to you is our legitimate interest in allowing teachers to utilize up to date features in our Services. We provide you with an option to out-out from having the AI features made available to you in the Service, which reflects your right to object to our processing of your personal data when the processing is based on a legitimate interest.¬†

### **If you are a Student:**

Showbie collects limited¬†Personal Data¬†from minor students only as needed for the operation and management of the Services provided by Showbie, and only where that student‚Äôs school board, educational institution, or teacher has contracted with Showbie to do so.

Data we collect from students:

* Name, if provided by the student when prompted in an activity
* Students‚Äô activities within the service, such as quiz results.
* Anonymous Diagnostic Data includes but is not limited to anonymized IP address, Error Handling, and anonymized Device Information.

Data that could be inferred from the teacher data:

* Name when provided by the teacher in a rostered room
* Email when provided by the teacher in a rostered room
* Student ID when provided by the teacher in a rostered room
* School name
* Location of school

Teachers may upload (import) a class roster which includes unique usernames and passwords for each student. When not importing a class rosters, teachers can provide a code for students to access the app, and creating a student profile is not required.

Teachers will have access to class rosters and students‚Äô activities within the service, such as quiz results.

Teachers may share template quizzes, tests, etc. with other persons using Socrative, but these templates do not contain any Personal Data about students, only the name of the teacher author.

When corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise, we ask you to disclose only as much information as is necessary to provide you with our Services or to submit a question/suggestion/comment in relation to our Services or products.

(a)¬†It is the responsibility of our customers, e.g. the school board, educational institution, or teacher to obtain the consent of parents/legal guardians prior to our collection of such student Personal Data. If you are a minor student, do not upload or send any Personal Data about yourself or other students to Showbie, other than what is requested upon signing up for the Services.¬†If we discover we have the Personal Data of a student without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, we will permanently destroy that information as quickly as possible. If you believe a student may have provided us Personal Data without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, please contact us at¬†**[privacy@socrative.com](mailto:privacy@socrative.com)**.

(b) Students can sign up to our Services with a username and password. Your teacher may instead provide you with a code, in which case you will not be required to sign up to access Socrative. Students are unable to see the activities of other students, irrespective of whether or not they are members of the same course group on Socrative.

(c) The Application allows students and teachers to interact. This information will also form part of the Personal Data of students. However, we are a Data Processor of this Personal Data on behalf of the students‚Äô school board, educational institution or teacher who has contracted with us, and that school board, educational institution, or teacher is the Data Controller.  
  
(d) Showbie conducts a small number of user research interviews to gather constructive feedback from the users of the Socrative services. The feedback is used to improve and develop the services. Before conducting a user research interview we ask for the consent from those we interview, which are mostly teachers or administrators. When conducting the interview, some student data may be processed. This may occur as a natural part of the interview, e.g., if a teacher shares their Socrative interface with us during the interview. Showbie will make every effort to limit the collection of student data in interviews and the scope of the research is never targeted to student data. The incidental processing of student data may include the following: name of the organization, geographic location, age of students, subjects taught, extracurriculars participated in, example student work (uploaded files, annotated documents, comments), student names, student profile pictures, student class enrolment. For the processing of student data as part of the user research interviews, Showbie is the Data Controller.

When we act as a Data Controller for the purposes set out above, the lawful basis for the processing is the agreement entered into with us, or our legitimate interests in providing the Application and Services through our agreement with your school board, educational institution, teacher, or the like.

### **Information collected as part of our sales and marketing efforts:**

We collect, use and disclose Personal Data of administrative users or teachers for marketing purposes provided it does¬†**not direct advertising to any student users**, and provided that student Personal Data is not used or disclosed. We collect Personal Data relating to administrative users or teachers for relevant product or marketing communications. We will never direct advertising to students or disclose student Personal Data for this purpose. Users may unsubscribe from marketing notifications at any time.

We collect, aggregate, and anonymize data for system monitoring, quality control, marketing, and product improvement purposes, provided it does not entail processing of any Personal Data of users.

The lawful basis for this activity is legitimate interest in selling and marketing our services when advertising to existing customers and consent when advertising to new and potential customers.

In this respect, our trusted third-party service providers may have access to relevant Personal Data in order for them to provide their services to us.

* In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your Personal Data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;
* If we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired by a third party, information held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets;
* If we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction;
* As part of a project with other companies in the Showbie Group.

We may also be required to disclose Personal Data in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. When acting in the role as a Data Processor we are committed to using reasonable efforts in redirecting any access requests received from governmental authorities or to notify the relevant customer about the request, unless we are prevented by law from doing so. In any case, we will challenge any overbroad or inappropriate disclosure and disclose only the minimum amount of Personal Data necessary to satisfy an access request.

**How Long Do We Keep Hold of Your Information?**
-------------------------------------------------

In our capacity as a Data Controller, the time periods for which we retain your data depends on the type of personal data and the purposes for which we use it.

We will also retain usage data for internal analysis purposes. Usage data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Services, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

Our Data Controller customers, on whose behalf we process Personal Data acting as a Data Processor, collect and keep Personal Data. For further information on this, please contact your teacher, your school‚Äôs Socrative Administrator or the like.
