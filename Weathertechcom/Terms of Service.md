----------------------------------------------------

THE SITE AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SITE ARE PROVIDED BY WEATHERTECH ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. WEATHERTECH MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE SITE OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SITE, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.

WEATHERTECH DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SITE, ITS SERVERS, OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM WEATHERTECH ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WEATHERTECH WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF WEATHERTECH HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES) ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE SITE OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SITE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE SITE THAT RESULTS IN MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OR CORRUPTION OF FILES, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DISPLAY OR OFFER FOR SALE THE PRODUCTS OF THIRD PARTIES, OUR LISTING OR DISPLAY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT OF SUCH PRODUCTS.

CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

DISPUTES – \*\*\*\*IMPORTANT, THIS AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS

We agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to the Site or to products or services sold or distributed by WeatherTech or through the Site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these terms and conditions as a court would.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a certified letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Robert Aument, 300 S. Wacker Dr., Suite 2200, Chicago , IL 60606. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, WeatherTech will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class action, class arbitration, or a consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

APPLICABLE LAW
--------------

By visiting and/or ordering through the Site, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these terms and conditions and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and WeatherTech.

ORDER ACCEPTANCE/CONFIRMATION
-----------------------------

Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. WeatherTech reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. WeatherTech reserves the right to reject any order you place, and/or to limit quantities on any order, without giving any reason. If WeatherTech rejects your order; we will generally attempt to notify you using your email address you gave when you placed the order.

PRODUCT DISPLAY/COLORS

Errors will be corrected where discovered, and WeatherTech reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions including after an order has been submitted and whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, WeatherTech will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge. Individual bank policies will dictate when this amount is credited to your account. If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, you may return it in accordance with WeatherTech’s Return Policy.
