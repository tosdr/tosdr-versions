WEATHERTECH DIRECT, LLC PRIVACY POLICY - EFFECTIVE 1/1/2021
-----------------------------------------------------------

We value you as a customer and take your privacy seriously and we want you to know how we collect, use, share and protect your information.

This Privacy Policy tells you:

* What information we collect
* How we use that information
* How we may share that information
* Your choices regarding your personal information

This Privacy Policy applies to WeatherTech Direct, LLC and any of its affiliated entities ("WeatherTech"), [www.weathertech.com](https://www.weathertech.com/) (the "Site") and information or pages found therein. Our Conditions and Terms of Use govern this Privacy Policy. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Conditions and Terms of Use, the Conditions and Terms of Use shall govern.

If you visit or shop at the Site, you accept and agree to be bound by our Conditions and Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Please read them carefully. If you do not agree, please do not visit or use the Site.

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, contests, and promotions, and that we believe is necessary to administer our business. WeatherTech recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly. We collect information such as your name, email address, mailing address, and phone and credit card numbers that you provide when you begin the checkout process by entering your email address, place an order, join our mailing list, register with us or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. We also may collect information that we deem necessary to maintain and administer your account with WeatherTech. We also maintain a record of your product interests and your purchases online or in our retail store location. We may also collect information you give us about other people, such as the name and address of a gift recipient, or the name and contact info of a third party to receive any of our products or services. We may also collect information we receive about you from other sources, including third parties that help us update, expand and analyze our records and identify new customers.

### AGGREGATE AND ANONYMOUS DATA

Aggregate and anonymous data ("AA Data") are information collected automatically through the operation of the Site. We may collect usage data (such as which website pages you visit with us and in what sequence) through the use of various technologies. For example, we may collect IP addresses from individuals who visit the Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Internet. Internet servers, the computers that "serve up" web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any Personal Information, so although your session may be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information such as browser type or version. During some visits, we may use software tools, such as Javascript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages, page interaction information, and methods used to browse away from the page.

### USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

Like many websites, we use "cookies" or other similar technologies to collect AA Data. A cookie is a small data file that writes to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit the website. Cookies allow the website to measure traffic activity on the website and to improve your user experience, for example, by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, allowing you to visit restricted portions of the site, and tracking the progress and number of entries in activities that require registration or entry, such as sweepstakes, promotions, sales and contests. Similarly, if you have asked us to send you information about upcoming products and promotions, using cookies we collect information about which website pages you have visited and in what order ("Clickstream Data") that may allow us to narrow or limit the materials provided to you based on your prior online activities or preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent, but it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so. In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by using so-called "pixel tags" "web beacons" clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively "Pixel Tags") embedded in the Site’s content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1 x 1) that is ordinarily not visible to website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. This information is AA Data.

### HOW WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

We use customer personal information to provide accurate services and to advise our valued customers of promotions that may be of interest to them. WeatherTech does not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties. We may share your information with third parties to perform services on our behalf such as: fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending WeatherTech marketing materials, fulfilling subscription services, conducting research and analysis, handling and processing credit card payments. We may disclose your personal information to trusted third parties whom we engage to process your personal information for us. We may disclose personal information with other companies and organizations for fraud and credit risk purposes. We may disclose your personal information to third parties with regard to the analysis and support of your use of the Site. We may be required to share personal information in response to a regulation, court order or subpoena or discovery request. We may also share information to respond to a government request or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of WeatherTech, our customers, or others; to prevent harm or loss; or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.

We may also share personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition, dissolution or similar event. We may share personal information in connection with financial products or services related to our business such as private label credit cards. We also may share personal information in connection with co-branded products or service offerings. For example, if we were to offer a WeatherTech credit card, during the application process we may share your personal information with our banking partners that issue any such card.

### THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING AND LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

The Site may contain links to other sites or contain third-party advertising. These third parties’ websites and advertisers, or the internet advertising companies that work on their behalf, may use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on the Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They also automatically receive and record information from your computer and browser, including your cookie information. They may also use cookies, Javascript, Pixel Tags and other technologies to deliver advertisements, collect information about the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad or to customize the advertising content you see (but not your name, address or other personal information). The third parties’ use of their own cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. For information about these specialized cookies and other technologies, and how to "opt out" of information collection by these companies, we suggest you visit [https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) or [https://thenai.org/opt-out](https://thenai.org/opt-out/)

Please be aware that the Site may contain links to other sites that will not follow the same Privacy Policy as WeatherTech. Clicking on an advertisement or on links or other elements on the website may take you to an entirely different website. These websites may send their own cookies to you and may collect data and make use of that data in ways that WeatherTech would not. Once you have left the Site, this Privacy Policy will no longer apply to any personal information or any other data collected from or provided by you. You should review the applicable privacy policy to determine how that other website will handle such data.

### DATA SECURITY DISCLAIMER

It may be possible for third parties not under the control of WeatherTech to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.

### CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a user is under the age of 13 and has registered with WeatherTech without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable information from our files. Please note that we nevertheless maintain a record of that person’s name and address in a "do not register" file to avoid subsequent registration by a child under the age of 13. By using this website you agree to respond truthfully and accurately about your age. Children under the age of 13 years are expressly prohibited from submitting or providing any personal information on the Site.

### USER CONSENT

By providing any personal information to WeatherTech, all users, including, without limitation, users in all foreign countries, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of such personal information across international borders in accordance with WeatherTech standard operations, including the collection, storage and processing of such information in the United States of America.

### CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY

WeatherTech may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please review the Privacy Policy periodically. Each and any version and subsequent update of this Privacy Policy can also be printed for your records upon your review.
