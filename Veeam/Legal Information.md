Use of Personal Information
---------------------------

We use the Personal Information we collect for the following purposes:

* _To Provide Requested Information or Materials, or Register You for Events, Programs, or Conferences_. For example, we may use Personal Information to deliver materials requested about a specific product, to answer a question asked about how a product works, to deliver a requested product download or license keys for product licenses purchased, or to register you for a Veeam conference or event you have registered to attend.
* _To Market Our Products and Services._ For example, we may use Personal Information to provide marketing and promotional information about products and services that Veeam offers. Information you have provided to third parties may be combined with information we already have about you and may be used to create more tailored advertising and products. For information about how you can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time, or withdraw your consent to receive such communications, see the section titled “Your Data Privacy Rights.”
* _For Business Analytics._ For example, we may use Personal Information to track behavior at the aggregate/anonymous level to identify and understand trends in usage and the various interactions with our websites and marketing content and determining the effectiveness of our marketing.
* _For Website Optimization._ For example, we may use Personal Information to administer our website and for internal operations of the website, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, and statistical purposes; to improve user experience; and as a part of our efforts to keep our websites safe and secure.
* _To Comply With Our Legal Obligations._ For example, we may use Personal Information to identify website visitors, including for account authentication purposes; to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any agreement to which Veeam is a party; and to respond to valid legal requests for information.
* _Fraud Prevention._ For example, we may use Personal Information to prevent, protect against, investigate, or prosecute any fraud, abuse, or other misuse or illegal activity using our products or services.
* _Legal Claims._ We may use Personal Information to establish or preserve a legal claim or defense against a legal claim.
* _Other Purposes Related to Your Interactions With Veeam._ For example, we may use Personal Information to register you for an event, offer you the opportunity to participate in contests or promotions, to provide you with contest prizes or promotional materials (subject to any terms and conditions related to such contest or promotion), to create an account for you on our websites, to provide customer service (if you are a customer), to respond to a specific question, or to register you for courses or certifications that Veeam or its partners may offer.

Veeam will only collect, use, or share Personal Information for the purposes disclosed to you in this Privacy Notice.

Note that some of Veeam’s websites contain interactive elements, such as discussion forums and blogs that allow individual users to publish their own content which will then be made available to other users. Any information posted on these blogs and forums becomes public, which means it could be read, collected or used by other users in any manner.

_Lawful Bases for Processing._ In certain jurisdictions, we may only process Personal Information if we have a lawful basis on which to do so. The lawful bases for the processing described above includes:

* _Performance of the Contract._ Sometimes, such as when we use your contact information to send you information you have requested, the reason we process Personal Information is to perform the service which you have requested of Veeam.
* _Legitimate Interests._ In many cases we process data because it is in our legitimate interest to do so, and that interest is not overridden by your privacy interests. This applies, for example, when we process Personal Information as part of our fraud prevention program, where our legitimate interest is in ensuring the appropriate use of our services and products, or to collect business analytics data, where our legitimate interest is in improving our business, services, and products.
* _Consent._ In some cases, we do not process your Personal Information unless we have your consent to do so. In particular, we will not send you marketing materials unless you have consented to receiving them.
* _Legal Obligation._ In some cases, we collect, process, and share Personal Information because we have a legal obligation to do so. For example, if we are subject to valid legal process, we may have no choice but to provide the sought after information.

Disclosure to Third Parties, Service Providers, and Others
----------------------------------------------------------

Veeam may share Personal Information with our worldwide partners (e.g. marketing, education, distribution, and reseller partners, online marketplaces, data hosters and other service providers to or for Veeam) to perform one or more of the functions or purposes outlined above on Veeam’s behalf.

Specifically, we may disclose Personal Information that we collect or that you provide to us in the following circumstances:

* To our partners, service providers and other third parties with whom we share Personal Information to support our efforts to provide the services and products we offer (e.g. to analyze data, host data, provide customer support, teach courses related to our products, and deliver online and offline marketing communications).
* As required by law, such as to comply with any court order, subpoena or other law or legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a governmental or regulatory request.
* To related Veeam entities, for customer support, marketing, technical operations, and account management purposes.
* To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, sale or transfer of some or all of Veeam’s assets.
* Veeam also may share Personal Information with certain business partners, such as event and conference co-sponsors, to carry out transactions you request, or so that our partners may provide you with information about their products and services, or for research or analysis related to any event or conference for which you have registered, or where the business partner has a legal basis to do so.

Third parties with whom we share Personal Information are bound by all relevant and applicable data privacy laws and/or terms of confidentiality.

Cookies
-------

Veeam’s websites, advertisements, emails, and online services may use certain automatic data collection technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags, to collect data, including personal information. This data helps us to understand our users’ behavior, web searches, and where on our websites users have visited. We use cookies to distinguish among different users of our website, to help us provide you with a good experience when you browse our websites, and to allow us to improve our websites.

For more information about how Veeam uses Cookies and similar technologies, please visit our [Cookie Notice](https://www.veeam.com/legal/cookie-notice.html).

Google OAuth 2.0
----------------

Veeam software allows an end-user to use Google Mail as an alternative SMTP server to send email alerts and notifications to Veeam. In this event, Veeam software may use Google OAuth 2.0, which makes API authorization by an end-user possible without Veeam receiving end-user access data (for example, by the end-user entering his Google credentials directly into the Google authorization form). Relevant information, including the primary email address and access token are stored locally within the Veeam software installation folder on the end-user premises.

Information on the data collected by Google and how Google handles it can be found in Google's privacy policy: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) 

Your Data Privacy Rights
------------------------

_Generally_

Veeam is a global company, and we collect personal information from individuals all over the world. We strive to comply with all applicable privacy and data security laws around the globe, including GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and other applicable laws. To that end, we offer a number of tools to help maximize your control over the information Veeam may have about you.

If you have consented to receive communications, you can manage what information you receive from Veeam about products and services and how such information is received by specifying your communication preferences and subscription details at the [subscription preferences](https://www.veeam.com/subscription-preferences.html) page.

If you provided consent, but later wish to discontinue receiving marketing and/or non-transactional e-mails from us, you may do so in the “My Account” section of our website or using an "unsubscribe" link in any email or the Veeam [unsubscribe page](https://www.veeam.com/unsubscribe.html). _Note that this does not apply to transactional emails related to users’ business relationship with Veeam._

In the event you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, we may not be able to respond completely or adequately to your questions, provide updates, and/or information about our products and services. We will however continue to use your Personal Information for the limited purpose of sending you important notices relating to information about your purchases, changes to our policies and agreements, or for other reasons permitted by applicable law.

_Your GDPR and California Privacy Rights._

Where GDPR and CCPA applies to the Personal Information we have collected, you may have certain rights you can exercise under certain circumstances. These may include:

* _Right of Access/Right to Know/Right to Data Portability_: You have the right to request that Veeam disclose to you the Personal Information we collect, use, or share about you, as well as information about our data privacy practices.
* _Right of Erasure/Deletion_: You may have the right to request that we delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you or about you.

_Veeam does not “sell” your Personal Information._

Some of these rights can be exercised at the [subscription preferences](https://www.veeam.com/subscription-preferences.html) page. For example, you can correct certain of the Personal Information we have about you, you can withdraw consent for or object to certain processing, and you can restrict certain processing.

For any other requests to exercise your GDPR and CCPA privacy rights, please email us at [privacy@veeam.com](mailto:privacy@veeam.com) or send us your request by filling in this [form](https://www.veeam.com/legal/data-privacy-request.html).

Note that to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your Personal Information, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request. In some cases we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as a government issued ID.

Finally, under the CCPA you may exercise these rights yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. If you choose to do that, we may seek additional information to ensure that you have actually designated the agent to make the request.

Data Security
-------------

Veeam takes the security of Personal Information seriously. To protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, Veeam uses risk-based technical and organizational security measures reasonably designed to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or access. For example, Veeam has implemented strict security controls, intrusion detection software and processes to alert us in the case of a potential or actual intrusion of our information systems.

Storing and Transferring Personal Information
---------------------------------------------

Veeam is a global organization so the information you provide to Veeam may be transferred or accessed by Veeam corporate entities in Switzerland and other countries around the world. No matter where Veeam stores or accesses Personal Information, it is collected, used, shared, and protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

Veeam uses approved [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) for the transfer of Personal Information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland to third countries.

Veeam also abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of Personal Information transferred among participating APEC economies. 

Children’s Privacy
------------------

Veeam will not knowingly collect Personal Information from any person that is not a legal adult, as defined by local law, without insisting that they seek prior parental consent, if such consent is required by applicable law. Veeam does not target children in connection with its products, services, and websites. In the event Veeam uses or discloses Personal Information of a person that is not a legal adult, Veeam will seek parental consent pursuant to local laws and regulations in order to protect the person that is not a legal adult.

Links to Third Party Websites
-----------------------------

Veeam is only responsible for privacy practices of Veeam and its websites. Veeam’s website may contain links to other websites for additional information and convenience. Veeam does not control those other websites, endorse or make any representation about other websites, and is not responsible for the privacy practices of those other websites.

Use of Generative AI Technologies
---------------------------------

In our commitment to innovation and excellence, we may employ Generative AI technologies to enhance the creation, proofreading, refinement, and stylistic improvement of our content. This includes, but is not limited to, marketing materials, knowledge base articles, forum posts, technical documentation, and other forms of written communication. These AI technologies may be used to assist in ensuring the accuracy, grammatical integrity, overall quality, and engaging style of the content we provide to our users and clients.
