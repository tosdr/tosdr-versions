### 14\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH FLATIRON MEDIA AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

**14.1. Binding Arbitration**

Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, "Disputes") arising out of or related to a violation of Section 3 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Flatiron Media agree (a) that any and all Disputes or claims that relate to or arise from your use of or access to the Services, or any products or services sold, offered or purchased through the Services, including any contact from our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, vendors, clients or marketing partners must be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration between us and you, or between our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, vendors, clients or marketing partners and you, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. This arbitration agreement includes Disputes and claims related to, by, or against subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, vendors, clients and marketing partners, which are third-party beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement and shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this Agreement; and (b) to waive your and Flatiron Media’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Flatiron Media agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

**14.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions**

You and Flatiron Media agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services including but not limited to actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227 et seq., California Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code § 632 et seq., Florida Telephone Solicitation Act, Fla. Stat. Ann. § 501.059, and the Oklahoma Telephone Solicitation Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 15, § 775C.3 is personal to you and Flatiron Media and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and Flatiron Media agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and Flatiron Media agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

**14.3. Federal Arbitration Act**

You and Flatiron Media agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of this Section 14 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

**14.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution**

You and Flatiron Media agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Flatiron Media shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Flatiron Media LLC, 20 Jay St, Ste #1018, Brooklyn, NY 11201. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Flatiron Media account and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted; (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Flatiron Media cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Flatiron Media may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 14, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 14.1, file a claim in court.

**14.5. Process**

Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of Section 3 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Flatiron Media agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or Flatiron Media within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose, otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that you and Flatiron Media will no longer have the right to assert such claim regarding the Dispute). You and Flatiron Media agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in the State of New York, County of New York, Borough of Manhattan or via video conference; (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), which are hereby incorporated by reference; and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of New York, County of New York, Borough of Manhattan, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your current residence if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.

**14.6. Authority of Arbitrator**

As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable. This specifically includes any Dispute arising out of claims that you did not visit our website and/or opt in to receive communication; and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

**14.7. Rules of JAMS**

The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS; or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

**14.8. Confidentiality**

The arbitration proceedings and arbitration award shall be maintained by the parties as strictly confidential, except as is otherwise required by court order or as is necessary to confirm, vacate or enforce the award and for disclosure in confidence to the parties’ respective attorneys, tax advisors and senior management and to family members of a party who is an individual.

**14.9. Severability**

If any term, clause or provision of this Section 14 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 14 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 14.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

* * *

### 15\. VOICE RECORDING AND MONITORING CONSENT

You agree and consent that Flatiron Media may record or monitor communications made by you during any calls you make to Flatiron Media as permitted by 18 U.S.C. § 2511 et seq., Cal. Penal Code § 630 et seq., and other state laws that regulate call monitoring and recording. Flatiron Media is under no obligation to monitor or record its services for accuracy, completeness or quality.

* * *

### 16\. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE

These Terms and your access to and use of the Services shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of New York and the United States, respectively, sitting in New York County, New York.

* * *

### 17\. TERMINATION

We may suspend or terminate your ability to access and use all or part of the Services at any time and for any reason or no reason without notifying you first. Flatiron Media is not responsible for any harm related to your inability to access or use the Services.

* * *

### 18\. SEVERABILITY

If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.

* * *

### 19\. MISCELLANEOUS TERMS

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Flatiron Media and you and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements of the parties relating to your access to and use of the Services. These Terms, and any rights and license granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Flatiron Media. Flatiron Media’s failure to assert any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver or relinquishment of such provision or right. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
