Terms and conditions of use
===========================

Effective date: 12/15/2010

This document provides terms and conditions of use of Safeco.com (the "Site") and of the Safeco app for Apple iOS (the "App"), and provides additional information about Safeco Insurance Company of America, its affiliates and subsidiaries (together "Safeco"). Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using the Site or the App, as your use is expressly conditioned on your acceptance of the terms and conditions below, and any additional terms or conditions that may be within the Site itself (collectively "Terms and Conditions").

----------------------------------

  
From time to time, Safeco may authorize links to websites to or from the Site or the App. These links are offered as a convenience and are for informational purposes only. You should not interpret any link to or from other websites as evidence of Safeco's sponsorship, endorsement or affiliation with the website or its owners, sponsors or providers.

Safeco values and protects the privacy of your information. Please review Safeco's Privacy Policy, as it contains important information relating to our use of consumer and customer information.

Secured Areas / Passwords
-------------------------

  
Some pages of the Site and the App are restricted and require a user identification code ("User ID") and a password access. Unauthorized use of or access to these pages is strictly prohibited. Actual or attempted unauthorized use of or access to these pages may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution. If you are an authorized user of any restricted area, you are responsible to maintain the security/confidentiality of your password.

Disclaimer of Warranties and Liability
--------------------------------------

  
Any information, services, materials, software, calculators or other items on the Site or the App are provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including and without limitation the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement and freedom from computer viruses or similar disabling components. Safeco acknowledges that some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties.

Other than as required by applicable consumer protection law or insurance law, if any, Safeco shall not be liable for any errors or omissions in this information for any injury, losses, claim or damages, direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential resulting from your use or misuse of, or reliance on, any such information.

Safeco does not warrant the content, quality, condition, accuracy or completeness of this information. You assume all risks and liabilities arising out of use of the information, services, materials, software, or other items on the Site or the App.

Jurisdictional Issues
---------------------

  
Safeco makes no representation that all insurance products and services on this website are appropriate or available for use in your state. Some insurance products and services may not be available in all states or jurisdictions. If you choose to access this website you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any local, state and federal laws. The information contained on this website is not an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, any insurance product or service. No insurance product or service is offered or will be sold in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the insurance or other laws of such jurisdiction. Use of this site will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Underwriting Companies
----------------------

  
Safeco Corporation is a holding company for various Safeco entities, including Safeco Insurance Company of America and its affiliates. Reference to Safeco in these materials refers to one or more of the Safeco's insurance affiliates. Safeco's Insurer Licensing Information lists the Safeco companies through which our policies are underwritten.

Products and Services
---------------------

  
None of the information contained in the Site or the App should be viewed as an offer to sell or as a solicitation to purchase any of our products or services. Rather, the information on our products and services is provided to you so that you can learn what products Safeco generally offers. We may make improvements and/or changes in the products, services and/or programs described on the Site or in the App at any time without notice.

Insurance coverage statements on the Site or in the App are for general description purposes only. Neither the Site nor the App amend, modify or supplement any insurance policy. Consult the actual policy, your agent or contact us for the name of an agent who can supply you with details regarding terms, conditions, coverage, exclusions, products, services and programs which may be available to you. Your eligibility for particular products and services is subject to the final determination of underwriting qualifications and acceptance by the Safeco underwriting company providing such products or services.

Neither the Site nor the App make any representations that coverage does or does not exist for any particular claim or loss, or type of claim or loss, under any policy. Whether coverage exists or does not exist for any particular claim or loss under any policy depends on the facts and circumstances involved in the claim or loss and all applicable policy wording.

Unless otherwise specified, products and services are available in the United States only. Information on the Site or in the App may include references to products or services not offered in your state or country or not available for purchase over the Internet in your state or country. Variations in state law regarding the interpretation of insurance policies may exist, and any statements of coverage scope or intent in this summary are general in nature and are subject to such variations. Availability of coverage referenced in this summary may be dependent upon state regulations.

Electronic Transactions
-----------------------

  
You may formally apply for insurance on Safeco.com electronically. By doing so, you are consenting to "electronically sign" your insurance application and state-mandated forms rather than signing paper copies in wet ink. You may withdraw your consent to conduct this insurance purchase electronically by terminating the session at any time before your transaction is completed.

The Site or the App may contain an interactive insurance planning tool which provides suggestions about which insurance coverage, limits and deductions may be right for you. If so, review the questions and defaulted answers carefully before completing this transaction. When deciding which limits are appropriate for you, consider selecting the highest liability and deductible levels you can comfortably afford to ensure maximum protection and value for your insurance dollar. Suggested values should be considered minimum suggestions for your circumstances; higher amounts could be appropriate depending on your specific personal history, preferences, risk tolerance and other factors that are not accounted for in the planning tool.

Agents and Brokers
------------------

  
Although there are important legal distinctions between agents and brokers, for readability purposes, the Site and the App may use "agent" to refer to both. While Safeco's relationships with brokers and agents differ, including the fact that brokers do not have binding authority, agents and brokers may be exposed to similar tools and resources.

These Terms of Use state the entire agreement with regard to the items discussed above.
