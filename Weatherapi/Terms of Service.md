Service Level Agreement
=======================

This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) is a policy governing the use of API under the terms of the WeatherAPI.com Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) between WeatherAPI.com (“us” or “we”) and users of WeatherAPI.com High Volume (HV) API Services (“you”). This SLA applies separately to each account using WeatherAPI.com Services. Unless otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject to the terms of the Terms of Service. WeatherAPI.com reserves the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the Terms of Service.

WeatherAPI.com services for High Volume (HV) API customers are guaranteed to be available and responsive 99.9% of the time. If we don't meet this guarantee you are eligible for a service credit.

1\. Service Commitment
----------------------

WeatherAPI.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to make WeatherAPI.com instances available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage (defined below) of 99.9%, in each case during any monthly billing cycle (the “Service Commitment”). In the event WeatherAPI.com does not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.

2\. Definitions
---------------

The following capitalized terms shall be given the meaning set forth below:

* **“Monthly Uptime Percentage”** is calculated by subtracting from 99.9% the percentage of continuous 5 minute periods during the month in which a WeatherAPI.com instance was in a state of “Unavailable.” Monthly Uptime Percentage measurements exclude downtime resulting directly or indirectly from any WeatherAPI.com SLA Exclusion (defined below).
* **“Unavailable”** and **“Unavailability”** means when a running WeatherAPI.com instance has no external connectivity.
* A **“Service Credit”** is a credit, calculated as set forth below, that we may credit back to an eligible account.

3\. Service Commitments and Service Credits
-------------------------------------------

Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the total charges paid by you (excluding one-time payments such as upfront payments) for a WeatherAPI.com instance for the monthly billing cycle in which the Unavailability occurred in accordance with the schedule below.

| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| 100% - 99.9% | 0%  |
| 99.89% - 99% | 10% |
| Less than 99% | 25% |

4\. Credit Request and Payment Procedures
-----------------------------------------

To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by sending an email via [Support Center](https://www.weatherapi.com/contact.aspx). To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us by the end of the second billing cycle after which the incident occurred and must include:

* i. the words “SLA Credit Request” in the subject line;
* ii. the dates and times of each Unavailability incident that you are claiming;
* iii. the affected WeatherAPI.com instance urls; and
* iv. your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).

If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service Commitment, then we will issue the Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which your request is confirmed by us. Your failure to provide the request and other information as required above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit.

5\. WeatherAPI.com SLA Exclusions
---------------------------------

The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension or termination of WeatherAPI.com Services, or any other WeatherAPI.com or WeatherAPI.com Services performance issues: (i) caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including, without limitation, any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of WeatherAPI.com Services or its direct hosting subcontractors (i.e beyond the point in the network where WeatherAPI.com maintains access and control over the WeatherAPI.com Services); (ii) that result from any actions or inactions of you or any third party (other than WeatherAPI.com’s direct hosting subcontractor); (iii) that result from your equipment, software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (other than third party equipment within our direct control); (iv) that result from any scheduled maintenance; or (vi) arising from our suspension and termination of your right to use WeatherAPI.com Services in connection with any breach by you of the Terms of Service or otherwise in accordance with the Terms of Service (collectively, the “WeatherAPI.com SLA Exclusions”). If availability is impacted by factors other than those used in our Monthly Uptime Percentage calculation, then we may issue a Service Credit considering such factors at our discretion.
