**SWEEPSTAKES OFFICIAL RULES**

**NO PURCHASE, PAYMENT OR DONATION IS NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN ANY SWEEPSTAKES/PRIZE DRAW OFFERED VIA THE LAW & CRIME WEBSITE** 

**OVERVIEW:** Law & Crime (the “Site”) hosts multiple sweepstakes/prize draws (each a “Sweepstakes”). Each Sweepstakes is separate. Entry into one Sweepstakes is not entry for any other Sweepstakes. Details on the exact dates for any Sweepstakes, along with the prize(s) available in that Sweepstakes will be listed on the article post of each individual Sweepstakes. These Official Rules apply to each separate Sweepstakes; provided that if the Sweepstakes Page for any particular Sweepstakes references its own separate set of Official Rules for that Sweepstakes, then those Official Rules will apply.

**ELIGIBILITY:** Sweepstakes are open to all natural persons who are legal residents of the 50 United States and District of Columbia, who are at least 18 years old at time of entry. Void outside the USA, in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and other United States territories and possessions. The Sweepstakes is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations and is void where prohibited by law

**SWEEPSTAKES PERIOD:** Each Sweepstakes will begin and end at the dates & times listed on the Sweepstakes Page for that particular Sweepstakes (the “Sweepstakes Period”). All times are measured by Eastern Standard Time (EST) in the United States, which is the time in New York.

**HOW TO ENTER:** There are two ways to enter any Sweepstakes.

1. Newsletter Signup. Simply sign up for Law & Crime’s weekly newsletter to be eligible for the applicable Sweepstakes.
2. By E-Mail.To enter any Sweepstakes without signing up for the newsletter, simply send an email to [\[email protected\]](https://lawandcrime.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject line listed in the applicable Sweepstakes page. All emails must be received by the end of the applicable Sweepstakes period to be eligible

By participating in any Sweepstakes, you unconditionally accept and agree to comply with and abide by these Official Rules, the additional details on the applicable Sweepstakes Page, and all decisions of the judges, which shall be final and binding in all respects. All electronic entries for any Sweepstakes Monthly Period must be received during that Sweepstakes Period. Proof of transmission is not proof of receipt.

**WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION/RANDOM DRAWING:** Each Sweepstakes drawing will be chosen at random among the eligible entries received during the applicable Sweepstakes Period for that drawing per the “How to Enter” rule above. Each potential winner will be notified via telephone and/or email using the contact information supplied at the time of entry. The notification will include instructions how to contact Sponsor to provide name, address or other information that may be necessary to complete validation of eligibility and delivery of prize. No liability is assumed for any winner notification that is lost, intercepted, or not received by a potential winner for any reason. If a potential winner does not respond within forty eight (48) hours after the first notification attempt, or if the prize or prize notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable to such potential winner, such potential winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected. If a potential winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Rules or declines a prize for any reason prior to award, such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected.

**PRIZES/ODDS:** The prize(s) and value(s) available for any Sweepstakes will be listed on the Sweepstakes Page for that Sweepstakes. The odds of winning in any Sweepstakes depend on the number of eligible entries received for that Sweepstakes.

General Prize Conditions: Prizes are non-transferable, and no cash alternative or prize substitution will be allowed, except in Sponsor’s discretion. A substitute of comparable or greater value may be awarded if any prize listed becomes unavailable for any reason. Allow 4-6 weeks after validation for delivery or arrangement for delivery of prize. Potential winner (a) is responsible for any taxes due as a result of acceptance of the prize, and for any other fees or costs associated with acceptance or use of any prize not expressly included in the prize description, and (b) may be required to execute an Affidavit/Declaration of Eligibility, a Liability Release, and (where legal) a Publicity Release.

**RELEASE OF LIABILITY:** By participating, to the extent allowed by applicable law, you release Sponsor and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, employees, directors, and agents, including advertising agencies, as well as the beneficiary charity, and any named prize provide (“Released Entities”), from any and against any and all injury, loss or damage caused or claimed to be caused by your participation in any Sweepstakes and/or the acceptance, awarding, receipt, use and/or misuse of any prize, and you agree that Released Entities are not responsible for any warranty, representation, or guarantee, expressed or implied, in fact or in law, relating to any Sweepstakes and/or the awarding of any prize, except as expressly set forth in these Official Rules; you further agree that (i) any and all disputes, claims, and causes of action arising out of or in connection with any Sweepstakes, or any prizes awarded, shall be resolved per the procedures set forth in the Law & Crime’s User Agreement.

**ADDITIONAL RULES:** Acceptance of a prize constitutes winner’s permission for Sponsor to use winner’s name, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, statements and address (city and state) for advertising and/or publicity purposes worldwide and in all forms of media now known or hereafter developed, in perpetuity, without further compensation except where prohibited by law.

Sponsor reserves the right to suspend, modify or terminate any Sweepstakes, or any individual drawing(s), if Sponsor believes, in its sole discretion, that malfunction, error, disruption or damage is impairing or will impair the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of the Sweepstakes or such drawing(s), in which case Sponsor will attempt, if possible, to award the prize among the eligible entries received that were not affected by the problem. In the event of a dispute as to the identity of the entrant, any online entry will be deemed submitted by the authorized account holder of the e-mail account provided to Law & Crime at the time of entry and/or registration, provided such account holder must still meet the eligibility requirements for the applicable Sweepstakes. The authorized account holder shall be the natural person to whom the applicable email address has been assigned by the Internet access provider, service provider, or other online organization responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address.

Sponsor may conduct a background check to confirm any potential winner’s eligibility and compliance with these rules. By entering, you agree to cooperate reasonably with any such background check. Failure to cooperate may result in disqualification and selection of an alternate winner. If the prize includes the opportunity to meet a celebrity, attend a special event, or participate in any similar activity, or if Sponsor intends to publicize the winner in any way, and if a background check reveals that a potential winner (or guest) has engaged in conduct that could damage the reputation or business on any sponsor, as determined by Sponsor in its discretion, the potential winner may be disqualified and the prize may be awarded to an alternate winner, time permitting.

**WINNER LIST:** The first name, last initial, city and state of the winner(s) in each Sweepstakes might be available on home page of the Site for at least ninety (90) days after the end of the applicable Sweepstakes.

**DATA:** Any information submitted by you will be subject to our Privacy Policy, posted at https://lawandcrime.com/privacy/

**SPONSOR:** LawNewz, Inc. and the entity listed on Sweepstakes page.
