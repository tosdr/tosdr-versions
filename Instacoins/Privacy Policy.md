By accessing your profile, you can set your communication preferences. You can also make individual rights requests relating to your personal information via our live chat or by emailing [support@instacoins.com](mailto:support@instacoins.com).

### Right to withdraw consent

You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information collected based on your consent, at any time. Your withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of Instacoins’ processing based on consent before your withdrawal.

  
 

### Right of access to and rectification of your personal information

You have a right to request that we provide you a copy of your personal information held by us. This information will be provided without undue delay subject to some fee associated with gathering of the information (as permitted by law), unless such provision adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.

  
 

You may also request us to rectify or update any of your personal information held by us that is inaccurate. Your right to access and rectification shall only be limited where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated.

  
 

### Right to erasure

You have the right to request erasure of your personal information that:

  
 

* is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;
* was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented, but later withdraw such consent; or
* was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.

  
 

Should we have made your personal information public and we are obliged to erase said personal information, we will take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other parties that are processing your personal information that you have requested the erasure of any links to, or copy or replication of your personal information. This will be done whilst taking into account of available technology and the cost of implementation. The above is subject to limitations by relevant data protection laws.

  
 

### Right to data portability

If we process your personal information based on:

  
 

* a contract with you; or
* based on your consent, or
* the processing is carried out by automated means,

  
 

you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another data controller, where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. A “controller” is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal information.

  
 

### Right to restriction of or processing

You have the right to restrict or object to us processing your personal information where one of the following applies:

  
 

* You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. In such instances, we will restrict processing during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information.
* The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead.
* We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
* You have objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Instacoins’ processing override your rights.

  
 

Restricted personal information shall only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if and when the restriction is lifted.

  
 

Notification of erasure, rectification and restriction We will communicate any rectification or erasure of personal information or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom your personal information has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will inform you about those recipients if you request this information.

  
 

### Right to object to processing

Where the processing of your personal information is based on consent, contract or legitimate interests, you may restrict or object, at any time, to the processing of your personal information as permitted by applicable law. We can continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defence of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.

  
 

### Automated individual decision-making, including profiling

You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, save for the exceptions applicable under relevant data protection laws.

  
 

### Right to lodge a complaint

If you believe that we have infringed your rights, we encourage you to contact us first at [support@instacoins.com](mailto:support@instacoins.com) so that we can try to resolve the issue or dispute informally. You can also complain about our processing of your personal information to the relevant data protection authority.

  
 

### Storage of your personal information

We will try to limit the storage of your personal information to the extent that storage is necessary to serve the purpose(s) for which the personal information was processed, to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as required or permitted by law.

  
 

Your rights to personal information are not absolute. Access may be denied when:

  
 

* Denial of access is required or authorized by law;
* Granting access would have a negative impact on other’s privacy;
* To protect our rights and properties; and
* Where the request is frivolous or vexatious.

  
  We may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests.

  
 

### Children’s Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 (hereinafter referred to as **“Children”** or **“Child”** interchangeably).

  
 

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from Children without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers without unnecessary delay. Please notify us if you know of any individuals under the age of 18 using our Services so we can take action to prevent access to our Services.

  
 

### Complaints

You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the EEA.

  
 

You are entitled to request to have your personal information reviewed, corrected, or amended, or to request that the same be deleted if inaccurate.

  
 

If you close your Account, we will mark your account in our database as “Closed”, but will keep your account information in our database for a period described above. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personal information will not:

  
 

* be used by us for any further purposes; or
* be sold or shared with third parties,

  
 

except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Policy.
