A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. The information that we and our providers and other third parties collect through cookies and other technologies, along with information that we share with them, enables us or our providers to recognize you or your device and to serve ads to you or your device. For example, these technologies may allow us to automatically collect information such as your IP address, geolocation data, unique user ID, Device ID, Mobile Ad Identifiers, browser type and version, character set, screen size and color, language, cell phone model, operating system and version, carrier, and Internet Service Provider. This information: (1) allows us to accurately and properly pay for ads placed on our behalf (e.g., an ad that led you to purchase or download one of our products) and get paid when you see an ad on  or about our Services; (2) helps prevent you from repeatedly seeing the same ads; (3) helps select and display targeted ads or other content on your computer or device (such as on a site or social networking service you are visiting or a mobile application you are using) that may be of interest to you; and (4) helps us measure and analyze interactions with our ads and Services.

Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
