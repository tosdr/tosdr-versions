A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. The information that we and our providers and other third parties collect through cookies and other technologies, along with information that we share with them, enables us or our providers to recognize you or your device and to serve ads to you or your device. For example, these technologies may allow us to automatically collect information such as your IP address, geolocation data, unique user ID, Device ID, Mobile Ad Identifiers, browser type and version, character set, screen size and color, language, cell phone model, operating system and version, carrier, and Internet Service Provider. This information: (1) allows us to accurately and properly pay for ads placed on our behalf (e.g., an ad that led you to purchase or download one of our products) and get paid when you see an ad on  or about our Services; (2) helps prevent you from repeatedly seeing the same ads; (3) helps select and display targeted ads or other content on your computer or device (such as on a site or social networking service you are visiting or a mobile application you are using) that may be of interest to you; and (4) helps us measure and analyze interactions with our ads and Services.

#### **Notice of Financial Incentive**

Foot Locker offers the FLX Program, a loyalty program through which you can earn points and later redeem them for offers, products, services, events, and other rewards. Membership in the FLX Program is free of charge. [Click here](https://www.footlocker.com/flx.html) to learn more about the FLX Program and to create an account. The FLX Membership Terms and Conditions are available [here.](https://help.footlocker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042738733-What-are-the-full-FLX-Program-membership-terms-and-conditions) After you join, you can deactivate your account at any time by calling Customer Service at 800.991.6883.

We collect personal information in connection with the FLX Program in order to run the FLX Program, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement, including your first and last name, date of birth, zip code, gender, and email address.  Because we collect personal information, this may be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under California law or a “bona fide loyalty program” under Colorado law. Foot Locker uses and may disclose this information for the purpose described above under [“Notice at Collection of Personal Information.”](https://help.footlocker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034125214#h_01J1G9R56XEWBYXJDMRCTYH6WB) The value of your personal information that we collect in connection with the FLX Program is reasonably related to the expenses related to the discounts and other perks that we offer to FLX Program members.

Foot Locker may also offer promotions or discounts when you provide your contact information and enroll to receive direct marketing messages.  We collect personal information in connection with these promotions or discounts as described in the section entitled [Information Collection](https://help.footlocker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034125214#h_01J1G9TS30Z8W3YQSG783AMW7D)

for purposes described above under “[Notice at Collection of Personal Information](https://help.footlocker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034125214#h_01J1G9R56XEWBYXJDMRCTYH6WB)”,  including your name, email address, or phone number. Because we collect personal information, this may be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under California law or a “bona fide loyalty program” under Colorado law.  Foot Locker uses and may disclose this information for the purposes described above under [“Notice at Collection of Personal Information](https://help.footlocker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034125214#h_01J1G9R56XEWBYXJDMRCTYH6WB).”

The complete terms of the promotion or discount are provided when you enroll to receive direct marketing messages. You may un-enroll in direct marketing messages at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” in email marketing or replying “Stop” to text message marketing. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will not be able to provide you with access to the benefits associated with such direct marketing messages.
