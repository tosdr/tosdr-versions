This Agreement governs your use of or access to COGNOSPHERE Game(s), our online website, any game-specific site, software systems, customer support, social media, community channels and/or any other online services provided by COGNOSPHERE and by any of our authorized third party (collectively the "COGNOSPHERE Services"), whether as a guest or a Registered User (as defined below).

In particular, we draw your attention to some important terms in this Agreement. By accepting this Agreement:

·       You agree to COGNOSPHERE rules and policies that are expressly incorporated into this Agreement, including our Privacy Policy, which explains what Information we collect from you and how we protect it.

·       You agree to resolve disputes between you and COGNOSPHERE in individual arbitration, and not in court, as set forth in Sections 19 and 19A below. We have put this up front, bold, and in all caps due to its importance:

**THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN SECTIONS 19 AND 19A BELOW. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBED IN THOSE SECTIONS, YOU AND COGNOSPHERE AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT INDIVIDUALLY OR AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND COGNOSPHERE FURTHER WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

NOTE FOR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS: YOU SHOULD NEVER ALLOW CHILDREN IN YOUR CARE TO USE ANY OF THE SERVICES WHILE UNSUPERVISED. PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOUR CHILDREN DO NOT GIVE OUT TOO MUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND THAT THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE SERVICES SAFELY.

"COGNOSPHERE Game(s)" refer to any game(s) that COGNOSPHERE has launched or in the future will launch, or any of its game(s) during the test process.

COGNOSPHERE Game(s) include but are not limited to the software of COGNOSPHERE Game(s) (including but not limited to the whole game software and any content, component, element or feature involved therein), any patches, updates, and upgrades to the application, any related content, documentation, add-ons, supplements, any game-related services made available to you by COGNOSPHERE under this Agreement, and/or any copy of the foregoing.

Please note the software of COGNOSPHERE Game(s) may contain Cheat Detection software or features. "Cheat Detection" means functionality intended to identify Cheats. "Cheats" means programs, methods, processes or other programs with software or hardware on any formats that may give Users an unfair competitive advantage within COGNOSPHERE Game(s).

If you do not agree to install the Cheat Detection software or at any time remove or disable the Cheat Detection features, alone or make combination with COGNOSPHERE Game(s), the license granted to you under this Agreement automatically terminates and you should immediately stop accessing any of the COGNOSPHERE Services.

Please note that the COGNOSPHERE Game(s) with the Cheat Detection software therein may collect and transmit details about your account, gameplay, and any potentially unauthorized programs and processes, subject to our Privacy Policy. In the event that Cheats are identified, you agree that COGNOSPHERE may exercise part or all of its rights hereunder. You confirm that, by installing, copying, running or otherwise using the COGNOSPHERE Game(s), you agree to be bound by this Agreement.

By making a registration or application for a HoYoverse Account, downloading the software of COGNOSPHERE Game(s), playing the COGNOSPHERE Game(s) (including but not limited to updates, upgrades, patches), browsing our websites, accessing various online operation or maintenance services, or otherwise accessing any services provided by COGNOSPHERE, you are deemed to have read, understood, and accepted all the terms of this Agreement.

COGNOSPHERE reserves the right to amend, modify or revise this Agreement at any time and you agree to check periodically for new terms. Please note that your continued use of the COGNOSPHERE Services shall constitute your acceptance to be bound by the newly updated Agreement.

**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, USE OR ACCESS TO THE COGNOSPHERE SERVICES IN ANY WAY.**

**1\. HoYoverse Account**

a. You may be required to register or have a HoYoverse Account ("Account") in order to use the COGNOSPHERE Services.

To create an Account, you will be required to register as a User and accept the HoYoverse Account Terms of Service. If you do not accept those terms, you will not be able to create an Account.

b. You may establish an Account only if you are a natural person and an adult in your country of residence, and you are not an individual specifically prohibited by us from using the COGNOSPHERE Services.

When you have successfully created an Account, as a registered user ("User" or "Registered User"), you need to create a username ("Nickname") to be used during your game play. You acknowledge and agree not to use a Nickname which is obscene or otherwise offensive. We are entitled (but not obliged) to filter out certain words and phrases that we consider unacceptable. Besides, while any registration process that we adopt may filter out certain unacceptable words and phrases, it can never be a comprehensive filter. Also, we reserve the right to terminate your usership or Account and have the right to require your re-registration with a new acceptable Nickname if, in our discretion, we consider that your Nickname (or its use) is offensive or otherwise breaches the agreement terms in any way.

**c. By creating a HoYoverse Account, you agree that you will:**

(i) provide accurate, up-to-date and complete information about you whenever prompted or permitted by any site registration process ("Personal Data"); and

(ii) maintain and promptly update your Personal Data and keep your Personal Data accurate, up to date, and complete.

d. You acknowledge that to create an Account, you must be at least of the minimum age for consenting to Personal Data collection under the law in your jurisdiction and that you are an adult in your country of residence (or at other age in your jurisdiction where you are classified as above the legal age of majority) when using the COGNOSPHERE Services.

e. You agree to provide accurate and complete registration information, and you are not suggested to create a Nickname that reflects your real name or other Personal Data.

f. You shall be responsible for keeping your Account secure and confidential (including but not limited to email address, passwords or other related account information). Also, you acknowledge that you shall be responsible for any and all actions performed, using, or accessing the COGNOSPHERE Services through your Account, whether or not authorized by you.

g. Each Account is unique and important to each User. You shall neither transfer or otherwise make your Account information available to third parties, nor use other User(s)' Account(s) at any time. If you sell your Account or other related information, COGNOSPHERE reserves the right to take action, including but not limited to the right to terminate your Account immediately without any refund.

h. We may terminate your usership or Account at any time for any reason without any further formality if we have reason to believe that you have failed to comply with this Agreement. If your Account is so terminated, you will not be permitted to re-register as a User without our express permission. If you decide to terminate your usership or Account, please contact our support service, and we may terminate it as soon as reasonably practical after receiving your termination request.

i. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account information and if any third parties use your Account or otherwise access your Account, you may not claim compensation from COGNOSPHERE. In the event of theft, unauthorized use or any other security breach pertaining to your Account, it is your responsibility to notify COGNOSPHERE immediately.

**THIS SECTION APPLIES TO ALL CONSUMERS AND PERSONS WHO ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCLUDING CONSUMERS AND PERSONS WHO ARE RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.**

**Please read this section carefully. It affects your rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.**

a. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of Singapore excluding its conflict of law principles.

b. Binding Individual Arbitration. You agree and acknowledge that any claims or legal actions between you and COGNOSPHERE shall be referred to Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC") for arbitration which shall be conducted in accordance with SIAC’s arbitration rules. The arbitral award is final and binding upon both parties. If the above arbitration terms are not enforceable on any dispute, both parties agree that such dispute shall be brought in a court in Singapore. You hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and/or forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction, whether by arbitration or judicial judgment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (an "Intellectual Property Action"), and each party reserves the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to stop and/or seek compensation for the intentional or willful misuse or abuse (e.g. hacking or falsifying location) of their intellectual property.

c. Informal Resolution. You agree that in the event of any dispute, COGNOSPHERE and you shall first attempt to resolve any such dispute informally for a period no less than thirty (30) calendar days before initiating arbitration proceedings. The informal dispute resolution process shall be deemed to have begun upon the receipt of written notice from one party to the other ("Written Notice of Dispute"). The Written Notice of Dispute must include the full name and contact information of the complainant, describe the nature and basis of the dispute, and set for the relief sought. The Written Notice of Dispute shall be sent to genshin\_notice@hoyoverse.com.

In the event that any such dispute cannot be resolved informally, you agree that the dispute, including any question regarding the arbitrability of the dispute, shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 19 above.

d. Class Action Waiver. You agree that each party may only bring claims against the other solely in their individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding in any jurisdiction. Furthermore, if the parties' dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then this clause 19(d) shall be null and void.

**19A. Dispute Resolution (United States of America)**

**THIS SECTION APPLIES TO ALL CONSUMERS AND PERSONS WHO ARE RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Please read this section carefully. It affects your rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.**

Arbitration is an alternative dispute-resolution procedure that allows us to resolve issues without the formality of going to court. By accepting this Agreement, including the Binding Individual Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions below, you agree that any dispute between you and COGNOSPHERE will be submitted to a neutral arbitrator for a binding decision, and you waive your right or opportunity to bring claims in court before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions or representative actions).

You have the right to opt-out of this Dispute Resolution provision, as explained below, which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or a jury.

For the purposes of this Agreement, including this Dispute Resolution provision specifically, "Dispute" means any dispute, claim or controversy between you and COGNOSPHERE regarding any aspect of your relationship with COGNOSPHERE, including those arising out of this Agreement or otherwise based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including but not limited to fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability, and/or scope of this Disputes Resolution provision, except as it applies to the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver set forth below. "Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.

a. **Binding Individual Arbitration**. If you live in the United States of America, you and COGNOSPHERE agree that, except as provided in subsection (e) below ("Opt-Out"), any and all Disputes, including their arbitrability, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration rather than in a court, in accordance with this provision. You and COGNOSPHERE further agree that you are waiving your right to a trial by jury or to a trial before a judge in a public court. By accepting this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that other rights you may have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and the right to obtain certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.

The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules") and the governing law of the arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of your residence. Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitration shall be conducted in a confidential manner.

You or COGNOSPHERE may initiate arbitration in the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your Written Notice of Dispute (defined below).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (an "Intellectual Property Action"), and each party reserves the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to stop and/or seek compensation for the intentional or willful misuse or abuse (e.g. hacking or falsifying location) of their intellectual property.

b. **Informal Resolution**. You agree that in the event of any Dispute, COGNOSPHERE and you shall first attempt to resolve any such Dispute informally for a period no less than thirty (30) calendar days before initiating arbitration proceedings. The informal Dispute resolution process shall be deemed to have begun upon the receipt of written notice from one party to the other ("Written Notice of Dispute"). The Written Notice of Dispute must include the full name and contact information of the complainant, describe the nature and basis of the Dispute, and set for the relief sought. The Written Notice of Dispute shall be sent to COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. 405 E Laburnum Ave, Ste 3 PMB 109, Richmond, VA 23222.

In the event that any such Dispute cannot be resolved informally, you agree that the Dispute, including any question regarding the arbitrability of the Dispute, shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with subsection (a) of Section 19A above.

c. **Class Action Waiver**. You agree that each party may only bring claims against the other solely in their individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding in any jurisdiction. Further, if the parties' Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, including but not limited to a class action, consolidated action, or private attorney general action, unless both COGNOSPHERE and you specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration. All claims and Disputes within the scope of this individual arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual class basis. Claims of more than one customer or User cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or User. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Dispute Resolution provision, or the AAA Rules, Disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. This specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution Provision contained in Section 19A shall be null and void.

d. **Right to Waive**. Any rights and limitations set forth in this Dispute Resolution provision may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Agreement.

e. **Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt-out**. Notwithstanding the above, you and COGNOSPHERE may opt out of the arbitration procedures described above. If you do so, neither you nor COGNOSPHERE can force the other to arbitrate.

You or COGNOSPHERE may opt out of these arbitration procedures and pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (i) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (ii) YOU PROVIDE COGNOSPHERE WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR DESIRE TO OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the "Arbitration Opt-Out Notice"). The Arbitration Opt-Out Notice must include your name and address, your in-game username and the email address you used to set up your in-game account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you wish not to resolve Disputes with COGNOSPHERE through arbitration. You must mail your opt-out notice to COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. 405 E Laburnum Ave, Ste 3 PMB 109, Richmond, VA 23222. If you do not provide COGNOSPHERE with an Arbitration Opt-Out Notice within 30 days from the date that you first consent to this Agreement, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

f. **Continuation**. This Dispute Resolution provision shall survive the termination of your Account (if applicable), and/or your access to or use of the COGNOSPHERE Services, and/or your relationship with COGNOSPHERE.
