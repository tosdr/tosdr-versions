**Security**

We strive to ensure that our systems are secure and that they meet industry standards. We seek to protect non-public Personal Information that is provided to BlockFi by third parties and you by implementing physical and electronic safeguards. Where we believe appropriate, we employ security measures such as, but not limited to, firewalls, intrusion prevention, encryption technology, user authentication systems (e.g., passwords and personal identification numbers, as well as multi-factor authentication) and access control mechanisms to control access to systems and data. We endeavor to engage service providers that have security and confidentiality policies, if such service providers have access to our clients’ Personal Information. We train and instruct our employees to use strict standards of care in handling the personal financial information of clients. As a general policy, our staff will not discuss or disclose information regarding an account except with authorized personnel of our service providers, as required by applicable laws and regulatory requirements, or pursuant to a regulatory request and/or authority.

Despite our efforts to protect the security of your information, no security system is always effective and we cannot guarantee that our systems will be completely secure. However, we do have processes and procedures in place to remediate security risks and address any suspected or actual data breach, and will notify you and regulators of a data breach where required by applicable law.

**Retention**

We are required under applicable laws and regulatory requirements to retain certain information, including, but not limited to, Personal Information of clients, client profiles, identification verification materials, information we use to satisfy our Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations, account information, account agreements, trade orders, trade confirmations and other agreements, account statements, and other records.

Such records are generally retained as required by law, rule or regulation, or for the minimum amount of time necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it was collected, and thereafter no longer than is permitted under BlockFi’s data retention policies.

Should you decide to close your account, we will mark your account “Closed”, but will retain copies of information about you and any transactions or services in which you may have participated in accordance with applicable law and for a period of time that is consistent with such law, applicable statute of limitations, or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to detect or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our services and products, to assist with investigations, to enforce any of our terms and conditions or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law or in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor shared with third parties, except as stated in this section. 

**Storing, Transferring, or Processing Your Personal Information Internationally**

We may share your Personal Information with affiliate companies, service providers, and other third parties who may access or store this information in various countries, including countries without a level of data protection deemed ‘adequate’ by the European Commission, such as, but not limited to, Argentina, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Philippines, Poland, United Kingdom, and Singapore. You consent to the transfer of your information, including Personal Information, to these countries as set forth in this Privacy Policy by visiting our site or using our services and products.

**Your Privacy Rights**

Depending on the jurisdiction where you reside, you have certain rights over your Personal Information. These rights may include, but are not limited to, the rights described in “General Data Protection Regulation (Applicable to European Union (EU) Residents)” and “California Privacy Rights (Applicable to California Residents)” below.

You may exercise these rights, based on the applicable jurisdiction, by contacting us (How to Get in Touch with BlockFi). Note that we may refuse to grant your requests in whole or in part, as permitted by applicable law.

**General Data Protection Regulation (Applicable to European Union (EU) Residents)**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) allows individuals residing in the EU certain rights over their Personal Information. To exercise these rights, please contact us (How to Get in Touch with BlockFi). These rights include:

**Right to Access.** You may request we provide you a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and certain information about our processing of this information.

**Right to Rectify.** You may request we update or correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information or complete it if necessary.

**Right to Erasure.** You may request we delete your Personal Information from our records subject to certain exceptions. For example, we may deny your request if retaining your Personal Information is required under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: complying with a legal obligation; establishing, exercising or defending legal claims; or performing a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority.

**Right to Data Portability.** You may request we transfer a machine-readable copy of your Personal Information to you or a third party of your choice. We will provide you, or the third party, your Personal Information in a machine-readable format. This right only applies to Personal Information you have consented for us to use.

**Right to Restrict Processing.** You may request we restrict or suppress the processing of your Personal Information under certain circumstances: to establish the accuracy of the Personal Information; where the processing is unlawful, but you do not want your Personal Information erased; where we no longer need to process your Personal Information, but the information must be retained for legal reasons; and where you have objected to our processing your Personal Information, but we need to determine whether our legitimate interest overrides your objection.

**Right to Object.** You may object to our reliance on our legitimate interests as the basis of our processing of your Personal Information that impacts your rights. You also may object to our processing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.

**Right to Withdraw Consent (“Opt-out”).** You may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on it to process your Personal Information. Withdrawing your consent does not affect the lawfulness of our processing of your Personal Information prior to withdrawing.

_Information We May Need from You_

We may need to request specific information from you (e.g., name and email address) to help us confirm your identity and verify your request. This is a security measure to ensure that your Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it, and that your Personal Information is not deleted at the request of anyone but you. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request.

_Time to Respond to Your Requests_

We try to respond to all legitimate and verifiable requests within thirty (30) days. Occasionally, it may take us longer than thirty (30) days if your request is particularly complex, you have made several requests, or additional information is needed from you to process your request. In this case, we will notify you within the initial thirty (30)-day period and keep you updated.

If you have an account with us, we may deliver our response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our response by mail or electronically. If we cannot comply with your request, we will provide a detailed explanation of why we cannot comply.

_Fees_

You will usually not have to pay a fee to exercise any rights listed above. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We may refuse to comply with your request under these circumstances.

In addition to the rights listed above, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Supervisory Authority if you believe that our processing of your Personal Information does not comply with the GDPR. You can find your data protection regulator [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). 

We would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns, so please contact us (How to Get in Touch with BlockFi) if you have any issues or complaints with our processing of your Personal Information.

**California Privacy Rights (Applicable to California Residents)**

**California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**

The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. It affords California residents specific rights over their Personal Information. To exercise these rights, please contact us (How to Get in Touch with BlockFi). These rights include:

**Right to Notice.** You have the right to receive notice, before or at the point of collection, about the categories of Personal Information we collect and its intended purpose. We may not collect additional Personal Information categories or use collected Personal Information for unrelated, new, or additional purposes without providing notice to you.

**Right to Deletion.** You have the right to request deletion of your Personal Information subject to certain exceptions. For example, we may deny your request if retaining your Personal Information is required under certain circumstances such as: to complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide goods or services that you requested; take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you; detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activities, or prosecute those responsible for such activities; or comply with a legal obligation.

**Non-Discrimination.** You have the right to not face discrimination for asserting your rights subject to certain parameters. Under the CCPA, we may not take retaliatory or discriminatory actions against any consumer who chooses to exercise any of these rights. Thus, we cannot deny you our services and products. The law prohibits any practices that are usurious, coercive, or unjust.

**Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information.** You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information. However, since we do not sell your Personal Information, there is no need for you to exercise this right.

_Information We May Need from You_

We may need to request specific information from you (e.g. name and email address) to help us confirm your identity and verify your request. This is a security measure to ensure that your Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it, and that your Personal Information is not deleted at the request of anyone but you, unless the individual is your authorized agent. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request.

_Time to Respond to Your Requests_

We try to respond to all legitimate and verifiable requests within forty-five (45) days. Occasionally it may take us longer than forty-five (45) days if your request is particularly complex, you have made several requests, or additional information is needed from you to process your request.
