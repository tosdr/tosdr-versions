 This Privacy Policy is being provided to you by Frontdoor, Inc. (“Frontdoor”), on behalf of itself and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”, “we” or “us”), including its brands American Home Shield (“AHS”), Landmark Home Warranty (“Landmark”), HSA Home Warranty (“HSA”) and OneGuard Home Warranty (“OneGuard”). This Privacy Policy applies to information we receive from or about you, including personally identifiable information, in connection with your access or use of: (a) the websites frontdoor.com, frontdoorhome.com, ahs.com, landmarkhw.com, onlinehsa.com and oneguardhomewarranty.com (together with any successor websites, the “Sites”), (b) other interactive properties, including, but not limited to, the Frontdoor® mobile application or the mobile application of other brands (each, an “App,” and together with the Sites, the “Company Applications”), (c) the products and services provided by the Company, including through the Company Applications or offline (the “Product(s)” and “Service(s)”), (d) offline communications with the Company, including direct mail, telephone and postal mail and (e) any other means or applications in which you connect with the Company or a third party from whom the Company receives information about you.

By accessing or using the Company Applications or our Products and Services, registering with, providing personal information to, or communicating with, the Company, you explicitly accept, without limitation or qualification, the collection, use, storage and transfer (including international transfer) of your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. THIS PRIVACY POLICY AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES UNDER THE LAW. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Company Applications, provide us with personal information or otherwise communicate with us.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We may collect different types of information about you, depending upon how you interact with us. This information may include personal information, Financial Information, demographic information, log-in information and Device information. Sometimes we collect combinations of all these types of information or aggregate some or all of these types of information to improve the Products and Services and facilitate other legitimate business purposes. In each case, when using the Company Applications, it is indicated on the Company Applications whether any personal information or demographic data must be provided for you to access and use the Company Applications or purchase the requested Product or Service.

**Connecting with the Company Applications and Information Provided by You**

**When You Register or Otherwise Contact Us.**  When you provide us with information (including personal information) in connection with a particular activity, you agree that such action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to receiving communications from the Company (and its affiliates and subsidiaries) through the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide the authorization to contact you. This means the Company may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.

**Registration Information.** We will collect personal information from you if you register on the Company Applications or place an order for our Products or Services, which may include, but is not limited to, name, address, phone number(s), and email address(es). You may not use a user/account name that is vulgar or otherwise offensive (as determined by the Company), infringes any trademark or other proprietary rights of others, or is used in any way that violates the applicable terms and conditions governing Products or Services accessible through the Company Applications or otherwise (collectively, and as applicable to specific Products and Services, the “Terms of Use”). The Company reserves the right to deny, in its sole discretion, any user access to the Company Applications or our Products and Services without notice, for any or no reason.

**Financial Information.** Financial information is information that you provide to us, including your bank account number, routing number, debit or credit card number and related billing information (collectively, the “Financial Information”). We require such Financial Information in order to process payment for the purchase of a Product or Service that you have requested. By submitting your Financial Information, you consent to our providing your Financial Information to those Authorized Third Party Service Providers as are reasonably necessary to support and process your transactions as well as your credit card issuer and banking institution. We ask that you do not enter Financial Information into your profile, except in the fields provided for that information.

**Facebook.** You may be given the option to link your Facebook account so that you can comment on the Company Applications and your interaction with the Company or take advantage of other features of the Company Applications. When you comment on the Company Applications using your Facebook username and password and click “allow” on the Facebook permission authorization screen, we will automatically import all information that you allow to be imported from your Facebook profile based upon your privacy settings at Facebook, such as your interests, _etc._ (collectively, “Permitted Facebook Profile Content”) and you give us permission and consent to:  (a) capture, record, store, use and display your Permitted Facebook Profile Content, including syncing access to such Permitted Facebook Profile Content when you are not using Company Applications and (b) otherwise use Permitted Facebook Profile Content as described in this Privacy Policy. The authentication of your Facebook login credentials is conducted solely through Facebook.

**User Generated Content.** The Company Applications may contain review or chat areas or other message, communication or other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with the Company (including through the Video Services), others or to post content on the Company Applications (the “Communication Services”). Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Communication Services becomes public information, becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by, the Company. You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when posting or otherwise participating on the Communication Services. If you post content, such as messages, reviews or photos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that Company Application or Communication Service and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services. We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content, including that which we deem inappropriate. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Communication Services.

**Video Services**.  The Company Applications may provide you access to certain video chat services (“Video Services”) to communicate with the Company’s video experts (“Video Experts”) who may provide assistance for your selected issue. Please note that your use of the Video Services is subject to the Terms of Use.

**Information Collected Through Technology**

In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies such as cookies, mobile tracking mechanisms, pixel tags, server-side tracking mechanisms, web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs to track and record certain information, including as relates to your use of the Company Applications. As you use our Company Applications, your browser, devices and server (and technologies imbedded in your browser, devices and server) communicate with mechanisms operated by us, our business partners and our service providers to coordinate and record your activity and fulfill your requests (“Usage Information”). We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Company Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) from your computer or mobile device used to access the Company Applications (each, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to the Device used to access the Company Applications, and our systems identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Company Applications and the website you visit after you leave our Company Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser, Device or otherwise. We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Company Applications.

The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies and other tracking mechanisms kept on your Device(s), which are then transmitted back to the Company Applications. These servers are operated, and the cookies and other tracking mechanisms managed, by us, our business partners or our service providers. For example, when you visit Company Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies or other tracking mechanisms on your Device(s). Cookies and other tracking mechanisms allow us to recognize you when you return to a Company Application and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies and other tracking mechanisms also help us detect certain kinds of fraud. “Cookies” and similar tracking mechanisms use a small amount of information that is sent to your browser, server or Device to store information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Company Applications.

Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the Company Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions (for example, opening an email). When you access the Company Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure responses to our communications and improve the Company Applications and promotions.

We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the Company Applications, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Company Applications and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

We use HTML5 features for data collection, tracking, and storage in our apps for mobile devices. HTML5 offers methods like LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and IndexedDB that provide alternatives to traditional browser cookies. These HTML5 storage methods can be used to store data and track user interactions across sessions but are not stored in the browser’s cookie files. Users can manage and delete HTML5 storage through their browser settings, app-specific settings, or LocalStorage on their mobile devices.

In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other similar tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to information that could reasonably identify you. For example, we use information we collect about Company Application users to optimize our Products and Services and understand traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with personal information. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information.

**Information You Provide About a Third Party**

If you send someone else a communication from the Company Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, _etc._) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Company Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.

**Information We Collect from Third Parties**

We may receive personal information from third parties who have purchased on your behalf, or recommended to you, our Products and Services (for example, Products and Services purchased by realtors who sold or rented you your home), which may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number(s), and email address(es). We also acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you have provided or that we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that the Company can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest to you and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.

If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules.

We may allow third-party companies to serve ads or collect certain information on our behalf when you visit the Company Applications. We use these third-party companies’ ad services, analytic, measurement, attribution and tracking tools to facilitate our provision of certain advertisements for our Products and Services and to better understand who is using the Company Applications, how people are using the Company Applications, how to improve the effectiveness of the Company Applications and their content and how to serve more targeted advertising to you. These third-party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Company Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other website(s) or mobile applications you may have visited. They might combine information they collect from your interaction with Company Applications with information they collect from other sources and use this combined information to send you certain marketing or other communications.

We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, we advise that you log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit to a Company Application.

**A Note to International Users.** The Company Applications are operated in the United States. If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Company Applications or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States.

If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy or how we handle your personal information, you will know either because (a) the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy will change or (b) we will provide you with a copy of the updated Privacy Policy that includes an updated Effective Date. By accessing the Company Applications or interacting with us after the Effective Date, you are deemed to consent to our then-current Privacy Policy for information captured after the Effective Date of that Privacy Policy.

**Disputes.** If you choose to visit the Company Applications your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the laws of the United States and the State of Tennessee.

**No Rights of Third Parties.** This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Company Applications.

**Contacting Us.** If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or the practices of the Company Applications and Communication Services, please email us at [privacy@frontdoor.com](mailto:privacy@frontdoor.com) or write to us at:
