### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:

Elevio and our third party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use various technologies to collect information, such as cookies and web beacons.

_What types of technologies do we use?_

We use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to improve and customize our products and websites ("the Services") and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Services without re-entering your username or password; to understand usage of our Services and the interests of our customers; to determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon; and to present you with advertising relevant to your interests.

_How do we use them?_

* **Where strictly necessary.**  These cookies and other technologies are essential in order to enable the Services to provide the feature you have requested, such as remembering you have logged in.

* **For performance and analytics.**  These cookies and similar technologies collect information on how users interact with the Services and enable us to improve how the Services operate. For example, we use Google Analytics cookies to help us understand how visitors arrive at and browse our products and website to identify areas for improvement such as navigation, user experience, and marketing campaigns. 
* **Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies.**  These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.
