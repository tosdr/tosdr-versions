During his visit to Ukraine, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has stated that Washington believes in Ukraine&rsquo;s victory in the war against Russia. He reassures that the American side will continue to provide defense assistance. The US Congress has been unable to approve new funding for aid to Ukraine for several months to continue arms shipments. This is due to the position of some Republican congressmen who refuse to vote on and approve the document.
