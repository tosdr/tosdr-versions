   [![A bartender pours a beer from a tap, at Signature Brew brewery, in East London, on August 19, 2022. The brewery boom started thanks to a tax shelter that gives a 50% tax rebate to breweries that produce less than 4000 hl per year, which, combined with relatively low installation costs, has allowed the emergence of hundreds of establishments in 20 years: 1900 last year in the United Kingdom, almost 5 times more than in the early 2000s. But according to the CAMRA, an association of British craft brewers interviewed by AFP, the boom in craft breweries in the country, is already slowing down and the closing of some establishments could accelerate due to cost inflation, particularly in energy.
