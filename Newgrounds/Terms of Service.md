Newgrounds Wiki: Terms of Use
-----------------------------

**I. Your Acceptance**

  

BY USING AND/OR VISITING THIS WEBSITE (collectively, including all Content available through the Newgrounds.com domain name, the "Newgrounds Website", the "NG Website", or "Website"), YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO BOTH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (the "Terms of Service") AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF NEWGROUNDS'S PRIVACY NOTICE, WHICH ARE PUBLISHED AT [http://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/help-information/privacy-policy](http://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/help-information/privacy-policy), AND WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the Newgrounds Website.

  

**II. Newgrounds Website**

  

These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Newgrounds Website, including users who are also contributors of content, information, and other materials or services on the Website. The Newgrounds Website may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Newgrounds. Newgrounds has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, Newgrounds will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Website, you expressly relieve Newgrounds from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Newgrounds Website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.

  

**III. Website Access**

  

A. Newgrounds hereby grants you permission to use the Website as set forth in this Terms of Service, provided that: (i) unless you are the content's original creator, you will not copy or distribute any part of the Website in any medium without Newgrounds's prior written authorization; (ii) you will not alter or modify any part of the Website other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Website for its intended purpose; and (iii) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service.

  

B. In order to access some features of the Website, you will have to create an account. You may never use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify Newgrounds immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although Newgrounds will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Newgrounds or others due to such unauthorized use.

  

C. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Website in a manner that sends more request messages to the Newgrounds servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Newgrounds grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Newgrounds reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Website, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Website for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Website with respect to their User Submissions. You agree not to bulk-follow users for promotional purposes or to run any scripts that auto-follow, auto-vote or otherwise imitate human activity on the Website. You agree not to bulk message users, whether manually or via a script.

  

**IV. Intellectual Property Rights**

  

The content on the Newgrounds Website, except all User Submissions (as defined below), including without limitation, the text, software, scripts (except where explicitly stated), graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, interactive features and the like ("Content") and the trademarks, service marks and logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or licensed to Newgrounds, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under United States and foreign laws and international conventions. Content on the Website is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use only and may not be used, copied, reproduced, distributed, transmitted, broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any other purposes whatsoever without the prior written consent of the respective owners. Newgrounds reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Website and the Content. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Content other than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of User Submissions of third parties obtained through the Website for any commercial purposes. If you download or print a copy of the Content for personal use, you must retain all copyright and other proprietary notices contained therein. You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security related features of the Newgrounds Website or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Newgrounds Website or the Content therein.

  

**V. User Submissions**

  

A. The Newgrounds Website permits the submission of videos, games, music, art, literature and other communications submitted by you and other users ("User Submissions") and the hosting, sharing, and/or publishing of such User Submissions. You understand that whether or not such User Submissions are published, Newgrounds does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions.

  

B. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Newgrounds to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Website and these Terms of Service; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Website and these Terms of Service. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Submissions. However, by submitting the User Submissions to Newgrounds, you hereby grant Newgrounds a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Submissions in connection with the Newgrounds Website and Newgrounds's (and its successor's) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Newgrounds Website (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the Newgrounds Website a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Website, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Website and under these Terms of Service. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once you remove or delete a User Submission from the Newgrounds Website.

  

C. In connection with User Submissions, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant Newgrounds all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Newgrounds or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; (v) impersonate another person; (vi) post photographs containing nudity and/or sexual situations. Newgrounds does not endorse any User Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Newgrounds expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Submissions. Newgrounds does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and Newgrounds will remove all Content and User Submissions if properly notified that such Content or User Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. Newgrounds reserves the right to remove Content and User Submissions without prior notice. Newgrounds will also terminate a User's access to its Website, if they are determined to be a repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has had a User Submission removed from the Website more than twice. Newgrounds also reserves the right to decide whether Content or a User Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to, pornography or defamatory material. Newgrounds may remove such User Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.

  

D. In particular, if you are the original creator of User Submission that you believe was uploaded in violation of your rights, simply e-mail us and we'll delete it. Otherwise, there's a little more to it (see next item).

  

E. if you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):

  

1\. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

  

2\. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;

  

3\. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;

  

4\. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;

  

5\. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

  

6\. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

  

Newgrounds's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is Tom Fulp (tom -AT- newgrounds.com). You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(E), your DMCA notice may not be valid.

  

F. You understand that when using the Newgrounds Website, you will be exposed to User Submissions from a variety of sources, and that Newgrounds is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Submissions. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Submissions that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Newgrounds with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold Newgrounds, its Owners/Operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the site.

  

G. Newgrounds permits you to link to pages on the Website but reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Newgrounds Website at any time.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.

  

YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEWGROUNDS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR USER SUBMISSIONS OR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND THAT THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.

  

The Website is controlled and offered by Newgrounds from its facilities in the United States of America. Newgrounds makes no representations that the Newgrounds Website is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Newgrounds Website from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.

  

**VIII. Indemnity**

  

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Newgrounds, its owners, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Newgrounds Website; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms of Service; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that one of your User Submissions caused damage to a third party.

In any case, you affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Newgrounds Website is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please leave Newgrounds immediately - there are lots of other, more pleasant web sites out there that won't horrify your delicate parents. Talk to your parents about what sites those might be.

  

**X. Assignment**

  

These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Newgrounds without restriction.

  

**XI. General**

  

You agree that: (i) the Newgrounds Website shall be deemed solely based in Pennsylvania; and (ii) the Newgrounds Website shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Newgrounds, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Pennsylvania. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Pennsylvania, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and Newgrounds that arises in whole or in part from the Newgrounds Website shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Notice at [http://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/help-information/privacy-policy](http://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/help-information/privacy-policy) and any other legal notices published by Newgrounds on the Website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Newgrounds concerning the Newgrounds Website. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Newgrounds's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Newgrounds reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. Your use of the Newgrounds Website following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. YOU AND NEWGROUNDS AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE NEWGROUNDS WEBSITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
