### User-Submitted Content/Conduct

Portions of the Learning Site (such as "chat rooms", "blogs" or "forums") may allow users to upload and/or post content, including both academic-oriented and nonacademic-oriented content. You shall not upload or post on the Learning Site any content that is libelous, defamatory, obscene, threatening, invasive of privacy, harmful to minors in any way, abusive, illegal or harassing, or contains expressions of hatred, bigotry, racism or pornography, or is otherwise objectionable, or that would constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party or violate any law, or that you do not have a right to make available under contractual or fiduciary relationship, or that is used to make commercial solicitations. Uploading or posting any such content may result in the immediate termination of your access to the Learning Site and, if appropriate, notification to law enforcement officials. If legal action is pursued any and all information collected by Wayside Publishing will be turned over to the appropriate law enforcement officials. This means that you, and not Wayside Publishing, are entirely responsible for the content you transmit to the Learning Site.

Wayside Publishing may delete, archive, make unavailable, modify or comment on any content submitted by you. You may allow Wayside Publishing to publicly share your content and/or to identify you with the content you have posted by providing express prior written permission to Wayside Publishing.

You shall not upload, post or otherwise make available on the Learning Site any content protected by copyright, trademark or other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of the copyright, trademark or other proprietary right and the burden of determining that any content is not so protected rests with you. You shall be solely liable for any damage resulting from any claims of infringement of copyrights or other proprietary rights, any claims by third parties regarding Wayside Publishing's exercise of the foregoing license and any other harm resulting from your submission(s) or Wayside Publishing's use or posting of such submission(s).
