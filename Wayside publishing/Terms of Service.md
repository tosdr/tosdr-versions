Wayside Publishing may delete, archive, make unavailable, modify or comment on any content submitted by you. You may allow Wayside Publishing to publicly share your content and/or to identify you with the content you have posted by providing express prior written permission to Wayside Publishing.
    
    You shall not upload, post or otherwise make available on the Learning Site any content protected by copyright, trademark or other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of the copyright, trademark or other proprietary right and the burden of determining that any content is not so protected rests with you. You shall be solely liable for any damage resulting from any claims of infringement of copyrights or other proprietary rights, any claims by third parties regarding Wayside Publishing's exercise of the foregoing license and any other harm resulting from your submission(s) or Wayside Publishing's use or posting of such submission(s).
