contentpass Terms and Conditions
================================

We are pleased that you have chosen contentpass. Data protection is important to us at contentpass. For this reason, we have created this service, which allows you to read online publications free of advertising and tracking as possible.

Below we present our Terms and Conditions, which describe our service and your rights in more detail. Please read these Terms and Conditions, our Privacy Policy and any other notices and conditions referred to herein carefully.

1\. Scope of application, general
---------------------------------

The contentpass is a service of Content Pass GmbH, Wolfswerder 58, 14532 Kleinmachnow, Germany (hereinafter „contentpass“, „we“, „us“, „our“), (AG Potsdam HRB 29401 P).

The following Terms and Conditions („T&Cs“) apply to our fee-based contentpass (advertising- and tracking-free visiting of websites; for more details see [3.1.](#service-general) and [3.2](#service-exclusion)). Excluded from this are services of so-called third party services, which are marked as such accordingly and are not offered by us, but by a third party.  

Your contract with us includes these T&Cs, our [privacy policy](https://contentpass.net/privacy) and any other terms and conditions accepted by you.  

Our contentpass can only be used by private individuals, i.e. consumers in the sense of § 13 of the German Civil Code (BGB). A consumer is any natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that can predominantly be attributed neither to his or her commercial nor to his or her independent professional activity.

2\. Amendment of the T&Cs
-------------------------

These TOS may be amended and modified by us from time to time for justifiable reasons, such as when necessary in the course of improving our service and adding additional features or as a result of scientific and technical advances.

If we change or adapt the T&Cs, we will inform you of this in good time, i.e. at least four weeks before it comes into force, as well as of your special right of termination (see below [7.2 Special right of termination](#sonderkuendigung)) and the consequences of a termination not received in good time.  

3\. Our Service
---------------

### 3.1. General

We enable you to visit the participating digital offers such as websites and apps (of our contractual partners, hereinafter referred to as „Publishers“) free of advertising and tracking. In this context, advertising- and tracking-free means that when you use our service while visiting the Publisher's offer, no third party components or services are used which have the aim of storing and using your personal data or behaviour. You pay us and we pay the Publishers out of our revenue. You are recognised as a user of our service by the Publisher and can visit their offers without advertising or tracking.

Such components or services are usually cookies, advertising trackers or plugins that regularly, but not exclusively, require your consent. The components and services could create user profiles from you, for example, and even across a variety of websites.

By using our service, the use of such components and services is prevented so that you are regularly not visible to third parties when visiting participating websites.

### 3.2. Exclusion of Publisher Components

Please note that advertising and tracking components for offers of the Publisher itself or other services of the Publisher are not technically prevented by our service. Among other things, advertising for the publisher's own products and the analysis of website usage for statistical purposes or to improve the offer by the website operator will still be possible. You can find more information on this in the privacy policy of the respective publisher, if applicable.

### 3.3. Availability of our Service

We maintain our service up to 99.5% operational on an annual average. We warrant that we will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that you receive the advertising and tracking freedom booked with our service to the extent we specify. This does not include scheduled maintenance periods, which will be announced in a timely and reasonable manner.

We are not responsible for the functionality of the Participating Publisher's site. We do not guarantee the functionality and availability of the respective Publisher's site. Please contact the respective Publisher regarding these malfunctions.

4\. Use of the contentpass account
----------------------------------

### 4.1. Creating a contentpass account

4.1.2. Your email address will also be used to verify your registration by sending you an email to confirm the creation of your account, in which we will ask you to confirm by means of a code.

Immediately after confirmation of the creation of your contentpass account, you can log in to your account or automatically visit the participating website free of advertising and tracking.

4.1.3. We reserve the right to delete multiple registrations.

### 4.2. Function and administration of the contentpass account

In your contentpass account you can manage your subscriptions booked with us. This means that you can terminate the subscription directly via your account.

### 4.3. Deletion of the contentpass account

You can delete your account with us independently at any time on your account page. The prerequisite for deletion is that you do not have a current subscription with us at the time of the intended deletion or that the term of your most recently concluded subscription has expired.
