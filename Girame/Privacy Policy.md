Widget not updating?
--------------------

**1) Allow Countdown app to work in the background**  
Some devices limit the execution of apps in the background, so you need to whitelist the app to run in the background and thus make sure widgets can get updated. To do so, please open the Countdown app and from the "Settings" please enable the "Run in the background" checkbox. Alternatively, you can also do this from your device "Settings", open the "Apps" section and enable the "Unrestricted" mode for the Countdown app.**2) Turn off battery saver**  
Battery savers on Android often also disable an app ability to work in the background (and thus to update widgets). Please try turning off the battery saver by bringing down the notifications panel and clicking on the battery icon.**3) Open the Countdown app**  
If you do not open the Countdown app you device might think it is unused, and thus disable it (even if you use the widgets). Please try to open the Countdown app from your launcher screen from time to time.Note: if you have a **Samsung** device, please open "Settings" browse to "Apps", click on "Countdown Widget" and unselect "Remove permissions if app is unused".**4) Reboot your device**  
Often, issues such as widgets not refreshing are resolved by rebooting your Android device.**5) Don't be on Do Not Disturb mode**  
Do Not Disturb mode can also prevents widgets from functioning properly.**6) Charge your battery**  
If your device is in battery saving mode it can also prevent widgets from updating.**7) Update Countdown app**  
Sometimes, the issues might be related to a bug in the app. Please try to install the latest BETA version of the Countdown app: [download from Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/me.gira.widget.countdown).**8) Update the Android OS**  
Also the Operating System may have bugs that reflect on widgets and apps to not work correctly. So, you can try to update the Android OS on your device.
