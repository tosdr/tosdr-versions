Privacy Policy
==============

**Last modified on July 9, 2024.** 

As noted in the policy below, the English language version of the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use will govern your relationship with Life.Church. You can also use an automatic translation tool like Google Translate to view the documents in your language.

**Important: Please Read**

Life.Church launched in 1996 launch in a two-car garage. Since then, we’ve become recognized for our use of technology to spread the Gospel. We began using video teaching in our services in 2001, were one of the first churches to offer online church in 2006, launched the Bible App in 2008, and more.

Our place at the forefront of digital ministry is driven by our passion to see technology leveraged to help people find hope, peace, and joy in Christ. The Life.Church app and our websites are tools we offer to serve our attenders by connecting them to one another and equipping them to become fully devoted followers of Christ.

Life.Church is also passionate about serving pastors and church leaders around the world to help build the “capital C” Church. Through Life.Church Open Network, leaders can download free resources, and trainings to reach more people.

Every digital product and service we provide is created to help more people pursue a deeper relationship with God safely and securely. We develop these tools as an act of ministry to serve you, and you have choices in your experience. You choose what you access, what you share, and with whom. Your data is yours. Life.Church does not sell your information, nor will we share it with others without your consent.

Every aspect of Life.Church’s digital tools are free, with no strings attached and no advertising. Our intent is to remove every possible barrier so you can know God more.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it discusses how we will collect, use, share, and process your personal information. By using Life.Church sites and services, you agree to this Privacy Policy and its terms.

We welcome any questions or comments you may have about this Privacy Policy and our privacy practices. If you have any questions or comments, you may contact us by mail at Life.Church, Attn.: Data Privacy Team, 4600 E. 2nd St., Edmond, Oklahoma 73034, or by email at [dataprivacy@life.church](mailto:dataprivacy@life.church).

The English language version of the Privacy Policy will govern your relationship with Life.Church. Where Life.Church has provided you with a translation other than the English language version of the Privacy Policy, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only. If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Privacy Policy says and what a translation says, then the English language version takes precedence.

**Table of Contents**

**Definitions:**

To make this document easier to read, we’re going to use some shorthand.

These sites are owned and operated by Life.Church Operations, LLC, together with its parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries, which we’ll refer to as “Life.Church,” “us,” or “we” throughout this policy. When we refer to persons interacting with Life.Church in this policy, we’ll use the term “you.”

**Your Profile and Information You Provide to Us**

We collect personal data when you provide it to us both offline and online. You do not need to provide personal information to use Life.Church sites. You can create a profile, which allows us to tailor our sites and services to be a more personalized experience. To create a profile, we require your first and last name, an email address, and a password to authenticate you when access your profile. Beyond the personal information needed to create a profile, you have choices about what additional information you provide to us, which may include your zip code, the names of family members, gender, social security number, and your marital status, all of which will be stored in association with your profile. Certain information may be required based on your specific request, such as your social security number for employment inquiries and volunteer requests; we will notify you of this at the time of such a request.

We also collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage in communications with us, including when you submit personal information or requests by emailing help@life.church. We retain those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our sites and our services.

When you interact with us, the information you provide us is generally stored internally in our third-party relationship management system, or “CRM system.” We will use this information to authenticate you and allow you to access your specific profile, when available. We create user profiles for offline purposes as well, which include volunteerism and inquiries concerning employment. We may combine the information you provide us for your profile and interactions with our sites with information you provide us through other Life.Church sites, services, and products and inferences we make from the same for our internal development to improve the overall quality of our sites, services, and products. We may also make recommendations to you for other Life.Church services based on the information you provide and we infer.

**Your Posts**

Our Life.Church sites have a wide array of functionality, including streaming video, creating prayer requests, and identifying and communicating with your Life.Church groups and teams. Some Life.Church sites may also allow you to publish, distribute, and display content to specific individuals or the public. We will refer to how you provide content and information as “posted” and the content and information posted as “user contributions.” User contributions may be made on public areas of websites and social media accounts you access through our sites or may otherwise be transmitted to third parties. Your user contributions are processed by us to facilitate your ability to create, use, store, and distribute user contributions as you choose. We will associate your user contributions with your account if you opt not to delete them.

If you disclose personal information, whether through collaborative postings, social media, message boards, or otherwise, this information may be collected and used by others. User contributions are posted and transmitted at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users or third parties with whom you choose to share your user contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that unauthorized persons will not view your user contributions, nor do we accept any liability associated with your user contributions.

**Giving**

If you choose to provide a donation through one of the Life.Church sites, then and only then will you be prompted and required to provide credit card, bank account, and other financial information necessary to process the transaction. We will collect the designation for your donation if you provide one, and personal information such as your name, address, phone number, and/or email address to ensure that your donation is used for the purpose you request and to provide you with an annual giving statement that itemizes your donation(s). We will also contact you periodically to inquire if you would like to give to another program, location, or cause. We may contact you through push notification, email, mail, or in-app messages to share these opportunities.

This information, excluding your financial information, is stored in our CRM system. As of the date of this Policy, we use Stripe to process your online donation payments. For information on how third parties process your information, please refer to their privacy policies found here: [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy)

For donations you provide to us in person or by mail, we store your financial information in our databases in an encrypted form for as long as necessary to process your donation and as required by applicable law and GAAP accounting principles.

**Life.Church Merchandise**

For Life.Church sites where you are able to purchase Life.Church-branded clothing and other items, including shop.life.church, your personal and financial information is provided and shared with our third-party contractors that we use to process your order. The third parties are identified at the time of your purchase. For information on how those companies use, store, maintain, and disclose your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies or contact them directly.

**Volunteers and Employment Inquiries**

You may apply to be a volunteer for miscellaneous activities and events in person at a Life.Church location, over the phone, and through one or more of our sites. You may also apply for employment in person and through our sites.

The information we require for volunteer and employment applications are your first and last name, telephone number, address, social security number, date of birth, and, in the case of a job inquiry, your employment history. We will store and use this information to process your application and associate it with your profile if one exists. We will use your social security number and date of birth solely for a background check in connection with your application to be a volunteer and/or employee. We will not share either with any third party except for third-party service providers that enable us to perform background checks and are obligated not to share your information or use it for any other purpose. If you become an employee of Life.Church, your personal information is also used in connection with your employment.

As a ministry volunteer, you may have access to third-party software which allows you to schedule and check in to your volunteer activity, as well as manage other volunteer activity. This location-based information is stored in association with your profile to enable you to see your past volunteerism, and we also use it for our own internal analysis.

**Automatic Data Collection Technologies**

**Disclosure on Your Behalf**

We may disclose personal information that we collect, or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy to fulfill our obligations, the purpose for which you provide it, a purpose you request when you provide the information, or any other purpose for which we have your consent.

**Disclosure by You**

If and when you share information through our sites, it is viewable by you and anyone else you choose to share it with. If you give access to your account to other applications and services, based on your approval, those services would have access to your shared information.

**Internal Disclosure**

We will share your personal data internally within Life.Church and its affiliates to help combine the personal information covered across the different aspects of Life.Church sites and our other products and services to help provide services to you in a manner that is personalized and useful to you and others.

**Deletion:** You may ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data. Please note that doing so may limit your ability to use certain functionality of Life.Church sites. Please note that an email address is required to have an account to ensure we can properly authenticate potential users of that account.

Certain laws may provide the right to make additional requests concerning your personal information. If you have provided us with personal information and wish to make such a request under a specific region’s law, include the phrase “\[Your State/Country\] Privacy Request” in the subject line of your request and send your request via email to [dataprivacy@life.church](mailto:dataprivacy@life.church) or via mail to Life.Church, attn.: Data Privacy Team, 4600 E. 2nd St., Edmond, Oklahoma 73034.

We ask that individuals making requests identify themselves with at least their name, mailing address, and email address and identify the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before we process the request. We may seek additional information to verify a requestor’s identity. We may decline to process requests if we cannot verify the requestor's identity or if we believe the request will jeopardize the privacy of others, violate any law or legal requirement, cause the information to be incorrect, or for a similar legitimate purpose.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under applicable law. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable request concerning your personal information unless it is excessive, unduly burdensome, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide a cost estimate before completing your request.

You can delete your Life.Church account credentials at any time using the settings function in the Life.Church application. To request deletion of all account data, you must follow the deletion request instructions above; however, when you delete your account, we will delete the information associated with your account, such as user contributions you have created, received, or shared. If you do not want to delete your account or this information but want to temporarily stop using a Life.Church site, you may cease use, and we will maintain your account and the information associated with your account until you resume use or delete your account, whichever comes first.

We generally retain and process information and user contributions associated with your account until your account is deleted.
