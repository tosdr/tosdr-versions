![CookieHub](https://www.cookiehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cookiehub-mobile-logo.svg)

### 1\. Services

1. CookieHub service is offered through the URL www.cookiehub.com (the “Website”).
2. Subject to the terms and conditions in the Agreement, during the Agreement Term, CookieHub hereby grants you limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide, and revocable rights to access and use the Services solely for your internal business purposes. You agree your subscription to access and use the Services is not contingent on delivery of any future functionality or features or the delivery of any other services.

### 2\. Account

If you sign up for CookieHub on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.

### 3\. Agreement Term

The term of the Agreement (the “Agreement Term”) begins when you sign up for CookieHub or first use the Services and continues as long as you use the Services.

### 4\. Account and Password

1. The Services are provided to Customer via a dedicated account on the Website, pursuant to which Customer will create a unique user-id and password.
2. You’re responsible for keeping your user-id and password confidential. You’re also responsible for any use of any account that you have access to, whether or not you authorized the use. You’ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your accounts.
3. You are solely responsible for any losses, damages, fees or liability due to your lost, stolen, hacked or otherwise compromised user-ids and passwords.
4. We don’t have access to your current password, and for security reasons, we may only reset your password.

### 5\. Fees, Payments and Refunds

2. All charges for the paid services (“Charges”) are posted on the Website, or otherwise set forth in the Agreement. You agree to pay for paid services according to these Terms. Charges paid by Customer are non-refundable.
3. The Services are a prepaid subscription service with monthly (30 days) payments. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in an Order Form, the subscription automatically renews at the end of the paid period unless explicitly cancelled before the start of new billing period.
4. Monthly payments are due every 30 days starting from your first payment . In case of an unsuccessful charge to credit card, we’ll automatically suspend paid features of your plan until your payment can be processed.
5. As long as you’re using paid services, you’ll provide CookieHub’s third party payment processor with valid credit card information and authorize us to deduct the monthly charges against that credit card. You’ll replace the information for any credit card that expires with information for a different valid credit card. Anyone using a credit card represents and warrants that he or she is authorized to use that credit card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that credit card and won’t be rejected.
