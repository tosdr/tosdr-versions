### No Guarantee of Information

Linux Hint cannot guarantee the quality or accuracy of any third party content posted on our Site. All written and video content contained on the Site have been created and published by third parties.

### Force Majeure

In case of force majeure, we are not obliged to fulfil our obligations. In that case we may either suspend our obligations for the duration of the state of force majeure or definitely repudiate these Terms of Use.  
Events of force majeure are all circumstances external to our will and control that render the respect of our obligations completely or partly impossible. Such events include, but are not limited to, strikes, fire, disruption of energy supplies or telecommunication networks or communication systems and/or the temporary down-time of the Site, or other third parties.

### Disclaimer of Liability

We make no representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, with respect to this Site, its content, or the information available on or through it; they are provided “as is,” with all faults.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LINUX HINT OR ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF REVENUES, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR COURSES ON THE SITE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), WARRANTY, STATUTE OR OTHERWISE. To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

We assume no responsibility, and shall not be liable for, any damages to, or viruses that may infect your computer equipment or other property on account of your access to, use of, or browsing of the Site, or your downloading or uploading of any materials, data, text, images, video, or audio from or to the Site. If you are dissatisfied with the Site, your sole remedy is to discontinue using the Site. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Linux Hint, our subsidiaries, affiliates and vendors, and each of their affiliates and related entities and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, and costs (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs), arising out of, relating to or in connection with your use of the Site including, but not limited to, (i) your violation of these Terms of Use, (ii) posting of any content (iii) any harm caused to a third party, or (iv) any other negligent or intentional activity.

### Security

Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability. We reserve the right to investigate occurrences and prosecute any user(s) who are involved in such violations. You are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Site, including, without limitation, the following:  
Accessing data not intended for you or logging on to a server or account, which you are not authorized to access;  
Attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization (or succeeding in such an attempt);  
Attempting to interfere or interfering with the operation of the Site, our provision of services to any other visitors to the Site, our hosting provider or our network, including, without limitation, via means of submitting a virus to the Site, overloading, “flooding”, “mailbombing” or “crashing” the Site; and  
Forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail or transmission to the Web Site.

### Geographical Use

Although this Site may be accessible worldwide, we make no representation that materials on this Site or the services provided through this Site are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States of America. We make no claims that the Site is accessible or appropriate outside of the United States. Access to the Services may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Services from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

### Mediation

Mediation is a process under which parties submit their dispute to an impartial, neutral mediator who will work to achieve with the parties a mutually acceptable resolution of the dispute. The mediator is not empowered to impose a solution on the parties. The parties agree to first pursue in good faith the mediation of any dispute arising out of the subject matter of this agreement before resorting to arbitration or any other legal remedy. Mediation fees, if any, shall be divided equally among the parties involved.

### Arbitration

Any controversy or claim arising out of, or relating to, this contract or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration, in accordance with the laws of the State of California, then obtaining, of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any Court having jurisdiction thereof. Any award concurred in by a majority of the arbitrators or rendered by the sole arbitrator (as the case may be) shall be binding and conclusive on the parties; and a judgment thereon may be entered in the highest court of the forum having jurisdiction thereof.

Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Linux Hint in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND LINUX HINT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THESE TERMS MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy and any separate agreements whereby we provide you services shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. The parties agree exclusive jurisdiction shall be in Santa Clara County, California for any and all issues arising out of the Terms of Use or any related documents or transactions.

### Attorney Fees

In the event that any dispute between you and us should result in litigation or arbitration, the prevailing party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover from the other party all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of enforcing any right of the prevailing party, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. In addition to the foregoing award of attorneys’ fees, the prevailing party shall be entitled to its attorneys’ fees incurred in any post judgment proceedings to enforce any such judgment.

### Artificial Intelligence

The owner of this website does not consent to the content on this website being used or downloaded by any third parties for the purposes of developing, training or operating artificial intelligence or other machine learning systems (“Artificial Intelligence Purposes”), except as authorized by the owner in writing (including written electronic communication). Absent such consent, users of this website, including any third parties accessing the website through automated systems, are prohibited from using any of the content on the website for Artificial Intelligence Purposes. Users or automated systems that fail to respect these choices will be considered to have breached these Terms of Use.

We have included on the pages of this website a robots meta tag with the “noai” or “noimageai” directive in the head section of the HTML page. Please note that even if such directives are not present on any web page or content file, this website still does not grant consent to use any content for Artificial Intelligence Purposes unless such consent is expressly contained.

### Miscellaneous

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy and any other policies or operating rules posted by us on this Site or in respect to the Site constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Site, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Use). Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Use shall not be construed against the drafting party. In the event that any provision of these Terms of use is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Use, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of the Terms of Use or your use of the Site. You may not assign the Terms of Use or any of your rights or obligations under the Terms without our express written consent. The Terms of Use inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns and licensees. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
