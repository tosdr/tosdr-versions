**Cookies and Other Data Collection Tools**
-------------------------------------------

Like many services, Plarium uses server log files and automated data collection tools, such as cookies and web beacons, as well as mobile advertising Id’s, such as AdID and IDFA (collectively, “Data Collection Tools”) to enhance your experience when you access or use our Service. We tie the information gathered by these means to our customers’ personal information. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain technical information from your computer or device, such as your IP addresses, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, clickstream data, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, game information and the date and time of activity on our Service, and other similar information. In some cases, we will associate this technical information with your ID number for our internal use. By using our Service, you consent to our use of cookies, web beacons and Data Collection Tools.

When you download or access the Services, we may ask permission to track your activity. If you ask the app not to track, we will not collect the advertising identifier associated with your device nor will we use information collected to deliver targeted advertising to you. We may still collect and/or use other information about your device to, among other things, analyze and measure marketing performance. If you initially consent to tracking, you may later disable that permission in your device settings or may withdraw your consent for specific apps.

We use cookies, web beacons, and Data Collection Tools for a variety of reasons, including to: (i) analyze the usage of our Service; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; (iii) manage advertising; (iv) allow you to more easily login to our Service; (v) help make your use of our Service more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.

We may also employ web beacons or other technologies for a variety of reasons such as: (i) allowing us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an email was opened; and (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.

You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the type of cookies you allow or refuse cookies altogether. You may need to take additional steps to refuse or disable other types of technologies, such as Adobe Flash cookies. We invite you to visit the support websites of the various browsers you may use to learn on how to block the use of Data Collection Tools and to consult the settings on your mobile device for information about resetting mobile advertising IDs. However, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Service if you refuse/disable cookies or other Data Collection tools.

**Do not track disclosure**
---------------------------

Our Service does not respond to Do Not Track signals. For more information about Do Not Track signals, please click [here](https://www.allaboutdnt.com/). You also may opt out of certain interest-based advertising by following the instructions in the "Your rights and choices in relation to your personal information" section below.

**Third party services**
------------------------

Please note that third party partners/providers, such as analytics companies or companies delivering advertisements in our games or on the Service, may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices and providers are subject to their own policies.

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.

Our Service may contain third party tracking tools from our service providers. Such third parties may use cookies, APIs, and SDKs in our services to enable them to collect and analyze user information on our behalf. The third parties may have access to information such as your device identifier, MAC address, geo-location information, and IP address for the purpose of providing their services under their respective privacy policies. This Policy does not cover the use of tracking tools from third parties. We do not have access or control over these third parties. The following are examples of the third parties that we use for analytics:

_Google Analytics_

Plarium uses a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this Service. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this Site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this Site. Plarium uses the information it gets from Google Analytics to understand Service usage and patterns and to improve its Service. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit a Service, rather than your name or other identifying information. Plarium does not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with other personal information.

Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Service is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Site by disabling cookies on your browser or mobile device. For more information about Google Analytics, please see the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/). To prevent Google Analytics from using your data through a web browser, you can get the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

_Adjust And Other Similar Affiliates_

Plarium also uses third parties, including Adjust, to help understand usage of the Service and effectiveness of our advertisements. For more information about Adjust's privacy practices, please see the [Adjust Privacy Policy](https://www.adjust.com/terms/privacy-policy/).

**Sharing of information with third parties**
---------------------------------------------

Except as set forth in this Policy, Plarium does not share your personal information with any third parties. In the event we offer services or promotions where your information is separately collected and used according to the privacy policy of a third party, we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or promotion.

_Other Plarium users_. We will share your information with other Plarium users to provide our Services. For example, if you post a profile picture, that picture may be available to all other users of our Services.

_Third parties for legal, fraud prevention, and security purposes_. We also may share your information with third parties as required by legal or regulatory obligations; as requested by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability; or as Plarium otherwise deems necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, technical issues, or other threats to Plarium or others.

_Third-party service providers_. We may share the categories of information listed above with third party companies that perform services on our behalf, including payment processing (e.g., Payment Service Providers), order fulfillment, data analysis, marketing services, email campaigns, hosting services, and customer service. While providing the services for us, these companies may access your personal information, and are required to use it solely as directed by us for the purpose of our requested service.

_Third-party partners to provide the Service_. In conjunction with the running of our games we may partner with a third party to assist us in providing you with our Service. We will share the information you provide us through your social network, such as (1) your first and last name; (2) your profile picture or its URL; (3) your user identification number of the pertinent social network, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile picture; (4) the login email you provide to the pertinent social network upon registration; and (5) game play information with these third parties so they may facilitate the use of our Service as well as contact you about other games which may be of interest to you, service notifications and to solicit your feedback and input. If you do not wish to have this information shared please do not use our Service. If you wish to no longer have your personal information used by such partners you may contact us at [support.plarium.com](http://support.plarium.com/) and we will facilitate your request to the partner.

_Third parties in the context of a merger, acquisition, corporate transaction, or other legal process_. We may disclose your information to another entity in connection with, including during negotiations of, an acquisition or merger, sale or transfer of a business unit or assets, bankruptcy proceeding, or as part of any other similar business transfer.

_Third parties for advertising purposes_. We may use and share with third party advertisers (and other third parties) certain technical and personal information, and may allow advertisers to collect technical and personal information, which they may share with us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by increasing the likelihood that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). Please see the your rights and choices in relation to your personal information section below for more information about opting out of behavioral advertising.

Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We share your personal information only as described in this Policy. Plarium does permit third parties to collect personal information through our Service and shares personal information with third parties for business purposes. These business purposes are described above and include providing advertising on our Service and elsewhere based on users’ online activities over time and across different sites, services, and devices (so-called “interest-based advertising”). While we provide you the choices described above in the “Cookies” and “Third Party Services” sections, we do not treat these relationships as “sales” of personal information where that concept is relevant under applicable law. The information practices of these third parties are also not covered by this Policy. However, should these third parties be perceived as such, we provide options for you to opt out. You have the right to opt out of our sharing of your device and other personal information with these third parties by following the instructions in the "Your rights and choices in relation to your personal information" section below

Please note that if you use multiple devices to access our mobile or online applications you will need to renew this choice and will need to opt out separately on each device.

**International Transfers**
---------------------------

We may transfer your personal information outside your country of residence, including possibly to countries that do not provide a level of data protection equivalent to your country of residence. We implement appropriate safeguards to protect the personal information that we transfer in accordance with applicable data protection requirements. Where required by law, we put in place standard contractual clauses to protect your personal information. You can ask for a copy of such standard contractual clauses by sending an email request to [\[email protected\]](https://company.plarium.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Specifically, for our users resident in the EU or UK, please note that Plarium is located in Israel, a country that is deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission or UK government, respectively.  Where Plarium onward transfers your personal information to a company located outside of Israel, the EU or the UK, we will take steps to ensure that your information is given a similar level of protection as that given in Israel, the EU or the UK. You have the right to request from us information about, including a copy of, the contractual safeguards Plarium puts in place to achieve this.

**Data retention**
------------------

We will keep your information for as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above in accordance with applicable law, generally no longer than 3 years from the date you stopped using our services. To determine the appropriate retention period, we will consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process the personal information and whether we can achieve such purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

**Protecting personal information**
-----------------------------------

We strive to protect personal information while it is under our control. If you have an account with us, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To help protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk. You are also responsible for all uses of the Plarium games and applications by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been compromised or misused.

**Security**
------------

We have implemented technical, physical, managerial and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, please note that no system or network is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use, disclose, or alter your personal information for improper purposes.

To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable measures (such as requiring a unique password) to verify your identity before permitting you access to your account or the Service.

**Your rights and choices in relation to your personal information**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

_Accessing, correcting, or deleting your personal information_

Plarium takes your privacy seriously and works in a transparent way. In that sense, upon providing sufficient identification (to protect others' privacy), you may have rights under applicable law to request information from us about the personal information we hold in relation to you and correct any inaccurate data we hold.

Furthermore, depending on where you live, you may also have rights to change or request that we delete any personal information about you, such as by changing the applicable information found in your Plarium account. However, if you decide to delete or anonymize your personal information, you may no longer have access to certain content (e.g. information of your game progress) and your account may become deactivated.

In certain territories (including the EU, UK and Brazil), you also have a legal right to ask for a restriction of processing or to object to processing.

You may also have the right to withdraw your consent, on the basis of which we process your personal information, at any time, by closing your account or otherwise clearly indicating your withdrawal of consent. However, this does not affect our lawful processing based on your consent before this withdrawal.

Subject to applicable law, you also may have rights to request that we provide such information to you in a portable format, or to request additional information about how we collect or disclose your personal information.

The rights that you have are subject to conditions and may not always be applicable.

If you or an authorized agent wants to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at: [\[email protected\]](https://company.plarium.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or via [https://dsr-support.plarium.com/hc/requests/new](https://plariumplay-support.plarium.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000510320). Subject to applicable law, you can freely exercise these rights and choices. We will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your information or otherwise permitted by law. Once we receive your request from you, we may verify it through your account or by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity.

_Marketing communications_

Subject to applicable legal provisions, we may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Service you have requested or received from us.

_Push notifications_

We may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications to send you game updates, high scores and other service related notifications that may be of importance to you. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings.

_Behavioral advertising_

Users in the United States may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) [Consumer Choice Page](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by [DAA companies](https://www.aboutads.info/participating). You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) [Consumer Opt-Out Page](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by NAI members. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) or the NAI’s website at [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

Users in the European Union or United Kingdom may go the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) [Your Online Choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/) website and select their country to learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt out in their own country. For example, users in France may go to the [Contrôler ses cookies](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/fr/controler-ses-cookies/) website to opt out of certain third-party ad networks’ interest-based advertising and find additional information at [www.youronlinechoices.com/fr](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/fr).

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA [Consumer Choice Page](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/), the NAI [Consumer Opt-Out Page](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), or through the various EDAA websites will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or App or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA, NAI, and/or EDAA websites, your opt out may not be effective. Please note that if you use multiple devices you will have to opt out on each individual device.

**Links to other websites or applications**
-------------------------------------------

Links from the Plarium Service to third party websites or applications are provided for your convenience. In addition, content in the Service may be hosted by other websites or applications. Any personal information you provide on the linked pages or applications is provided to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy, not ours.

**Policy regarding Minors**
---------------------------

Generally, we direct our Services to a general audience, and we do not knowingly collect, solicit, or market personal information from children under 16 years old (or older, if required by applicable law), and do not wish to do so.

We reserve the right to request proof of age (for example, we may request your month and year of birth) or parental or legal guardian consent at any time, and we may block users if we suspect they are under the applicable age.

If we learn that a child under 16 years old is using the Services, we may block such use. If we become aware that personal information from a child has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.  If you learn about any personal information we have collected from a child under age 16, please contact us immediately.

We encourage all parents, guardians, and others of the age of legal majority to instruct children to never give out their real names, addresses, or other personal information without permission when using the Internet.

**Changes to this policy**
