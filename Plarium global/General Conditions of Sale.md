Refund Policy
=============

All purchases of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are deemed to be final and non-refundable, unless stated otherwise at our discretion.

No guarantee of reimbursement is given or implied through the policies outlined herein. Plarium will at no point provide cash refunds, though we may choose to reimburse users with game currency or virtual products at our sole discretion.

**Reimbursement for technical issues**
--------------------------------------

While we strive to provide a fun and stable environment for players to enjoy our games, technical issues may occasionally arise that may disrupt the game service. While we cannot prevent all such possible issues, the Support Team strives to help players who experience technical problems as quickly and efficiently as possible.

If you experience a technical issue while you're playing and have sustained some game losses, you may contact our Support Team via the designated email address for that game to let us know what happened. Please provide any available screenshots along with a detailed description of your issue and your request. We will not process player claims without supporting documentation as definitive evidence for these cases. When we receive a request for reimbursement, a Support Team member will review your request, verify the details, and take the appropriate action at the sole discretion of the Support Team and Support Team Supervisor.

The Support Team will investigate each case on a case-by-case basis at its discretion. Any compensation or recompense granted is case-specific and implies no obligatory action on similar cases. No Plarium employee outside of our designated Support Team is authorized to reimburse you or appeal the team’s decisions.

As a rule, reimbursements will not be given by Plarium unless the Support Team is able to verify that the loss occurred due to a game irregularity outside of normal gameplay, primarily as the result of a documented bug or server error. All reimbursement requests must be sent within a week (7 days) from when the loss occurred to be considered for reimbursement. Any requests submitted after such time will not be considered.

Issues which are NOT considered valid for reimbursement include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Potential or theoretical gain. Only assets lost when already in possession of the player are eligible for reimbursement. 2. Any losses attributable to problems with a player's system (i.e. computer, Internet connection, etc.) or any system owned by a third party are not eligible for reimbursement. 3. Being banned from the game for violating the In-Game Policies. 4. Timing out as a result of inactivity on your computer.

Spamming with petitions or emails requesting reimbursements or giving false information in an attempt to receive compensation are not permitted and may result in disciplinary action being taken against your account.
