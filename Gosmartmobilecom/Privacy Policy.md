### **Introduction**

Our Privacy Policy describes the information that we collect, how it’s used, shared, and retained, your choices about how it’s used and shared, and your rights under certain privacy laws. This policy applies to all TracFone brands including Total by Verizon, Straight Talk Wireless, Tracfone, Simple Mobile, SafeLink Wireless, Walmart Family Mobile, Net10 Wireless, Page Plus, GoSmart Mobile, and Clearway Wireless for Business. TracFone is a Verizon company.

We do not require you to provide personal information to us to enjoy some of our services. However, if you do not provide certain personal information, you may not be able to use or access portions of our websites, such as the account features or account information.

### **Categories and Types of Personal Information We Collect**

We, and service providers acting on our behalf, collect information when you purchase and use our products and services and when you interact with us. Depending on the products and services you use, the personal information we collect may include:

* Contact, billing and other information you provide such as your name, nickname, address, email, phone numbers, images, voice recordings or voiceprints, other biometric identifiers, date of birth, driver’s license, signature, other information needed to process payment, Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number, and information you provide in surveys and TracFone-sponsored promotions.

* Commercial and transaction information related to your payment method, credit card information, including account numbers, card holder names and addresses, phone or device purchases, airtime card purchases or redemptions, wireless plans and offers, activation and port-in history, wireless device loan repayment history and metrics, other financial information and records, and products or services you purchase or place into your online cart.
* How you use our services and your devices, which may include: call records containing phone numbers you call and receive calls from, websites you visit, text records, wireless location, application and feature usage, rewards program activity, product and device-specific information and identifiers, router connections, domain name server information, service options you choose, mobile and device numbers, technical configuration and other similar information. When you grant them permission, our mobile apps may also collect Wi-Fi, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) and other location information.
* Our cloud apps may backup your contact list, call records containing phone numbers you call and receive calls from, text records, text messages, your photo and video library, documents and music when you grant us the required permissions. In addition, depending on your mobile device operating system, we may obtain your permission to collect location information for scheduled backups or to locate printing vendors near you. Additionally, we maintain several internet websites and mobile apps to inform you about plans and services, and help complete transactions. As part of this, we may collect certain information including browsing history, search history, interaction with our websites and apps, and interaction with advertisements.
* Network and device information including how our network and your devices are working. We monitor the conditions of the network you are using such as traffic flow, speed, capacity, power, and environmental, as well as temperature and operating status of home network equipment such as your fixed wireless equipment. We collect location information about your wireless device including cell tower location information. This also includes how you use or access our service or websites such as Wi-Fi usage, IP address, internet browser, operating system, geographic locations, the domain name of the website and/or Internet Service Provider (ISP) from which you are linked to our websites, the model of the phone that you are using, your device identifier (UDID), web browsing and wireless application use information, date and time stamp, clickstream data to analyze trends in aggregate to administer our websites, and websites performance information. We may also collect aggregated network strength data. This data may combine geolocation information, signal data, and other information to help us monitor the strength and reliability of the services we provide to our customers.
* Demographic and interest information from third parties or from you to verify your identity or determine your eligibility for certain services. This may include age or date of birth, gender, marital status, disability, or military or veteran status. For example, this information may be required as part of the Federal Lifeline program to determine a customer’s qualification for SafeLink. We may ask you to provide a copy of your driver’s license to verify your identity.
* Educational, professional, and employment information if you submit it as part of verifying your eligibility for our Lifeline program. For example, you may elect to verify your income by submitting pay stubs.
* Your activity on our sites.
* TracFone always seeks to provide the best service, products, and selections to our customers. We may create customer profiles from information we obtain from third parties and develop inferences such as your preferences, predispositions, and behaviors. We use this to better develop products, services and offers, and to market to you.

If a child or other beneficiary is the qualifying recipient for the Lifeline Assistance Program, we will also collect the child’s or other beneficiary’s name, date of birth, and partial Social Security number to verify their eligibility in the program.

### **How We Collect Personal Information**

We collect information from you when you interact with us and use our products and services, including information about how you use these products and services and our websites, when you make a purchase, or when you establish or modify an online account. We also collect information when you interact with our customer service representatives or use our websites or apps to place an order or ask questions about your account or service; seek technical support; contact us on social media; enter a TracFone-sponsored or affiliate contest; participate in surveys, sweepstakes or promotions; refer a friend or respond to a referral; or participate in our rewards program.

We may use artificial intelligence guided by humans, such as chat bots, to respond to your inquiry. When you interact with us through third-party services like Facebook Messenger or Twitter Direct Message, your communications are also governed by these companies’ privacy policies.

Some devices may have pre-installed applications that are used by us and our partners to collect network strengths, performance, coverage, and quality, as well as for marketing purposes. Additionally, these applications may collect information regarding your device, such as device identifiers, features, and software versions installed, for campaign management such as push notifications or to preinstall certain applications. Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. To see what apps are installed on your devices, use your device app controls in the settings menu on your device.

We, and service providers acting on our behalf, collect information from our sites or apps using cookies, pixels, web beacons, scripts, application program interfaces (APIs) and other similar technologies. We use this information to analyze visitor activity on our site, to understand website traffic patterns and engagement, administer our sites, improve website and app security, authenticate you, detect and deter fraud, measure advertising effectiveness, to gather demographic information about our customer base as a whole, and for other business purposes. You can control the use of cookies using browser controls, but if you choose to disable cookies, you may limit your use of certain features or functions on our websites or services.

We also collect information from third parties. This includes demographic and interest data as well as device type, carrier, city and state information from third party data providers; information from social media platforms when you interact with us via social media or use your social media login to interact with TracFone sites or offers; contact, marketing lead, and other information we purchase or receive; and fraud information.

We also allow third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our app, for example through cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons, application programming interfaces (APIs) and social network plugins, to help us provide more relevant TracFone advertisements on our website and on others’ sites and apps. These ads may be tailored for you based on your activity on our sites and combined with your activities on other websites and in apps where these advertising companies are present. These advertising companies may also use information they collect for others’ advertising purposes. The use of information collected about your visits over time and across different websites, apps and devices is known as cross-context behavioral, or interest-based, advertising.

We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within a mobile application.

_Automated Processing._ We may use automated techniques including artificial intelligence to assist us with these uses. For example, we may use machine learning techniques with information we have about you and other customers to provide you with more relevant marketing messages or predict what services might most interest you.

For example, the data we aggregate might be used to analyze, personalize and improve our services. We may de-identify your CPNI and, if we do so, we will maintain and use the data in a non-individually identifiable form and will not attempt to re-identify the data.

### **How We Share Personal Information**

We share information within TracFone and with other Verizon companies for a variety of purposes, including providing you the latest information about our products and services and offering you our latest promotions. You can limit the sharing of Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI), which relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, location, amount of use and related billing information of your wireless services; and certain credit information, such as credit scores, your account and payment history and information in your consumer reports; with other Verizon companies for marketing services to you that are different from the ones you already have. Your choices about our use and sharing of CPNI and credit information are described in the “Your choices about how information is used” section of this Policy. We share information with service providers and partners. We use service providers and partners to perform services on our behalf, such as marketing, fulfillment services, shipping to customers and to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services. We will require that service providers and partners protect and restrict use of personal information consistent with the terms described in this Policy. Your wireless number may be shared for text messaging services operated by service providers. These service providers may directly contact you on our behalf by text messages with promotions, discounts, advertisements, reminders related to your services, or other information that may be helpful or informative to you. You can opt out of these messages using the mechanism provided.

We share information that identifies you with a partner who verifies your identity to facilitate your interactions with third parties, such as banks. Our partner also uses the information we share to assist third parties with decisions about credit applications that you submitted to a bank or other third party. Information about how to opt out of the disclosure of information for this purpose is in the “Your Choices About How Information is Used” section.

When you purchase or use services that are offered jointly by TracFone and one of our partners, both parties may receive information. When this is the case, you should also review the partner company’s privacy policy because it may describe uses of information that are different from ours.

We also share de-identified information with companies to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns or aggregate reports.

We may further share customer personal information in the following situations:

* With affiliated and unaffiliated service providers who help us perform and deliver our websites and services, subject to confidentiality agreements where reasonably feasible, including: service and sales fulfillment; form processing; website management and hosting providers; information technology and security providers; customer service; email and newsletter delivery services; background check providers; credit agencies; advertisement partners and corporate sponsors; and auditing providers;
* With third parties, including government and law enforcement entities; to protect our rights and property; to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of our products or services; and to protect our network, services, devices and users from such;
* To comply with valid legal process including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, and as otherwise authorized by law;
* With the appropriate government and law enforcement entities, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect your safety or the safety of others or in other emergencies;
* To advance or defend against complaints or legal claims in court, administrative proceedings or elsewhere;
* When needed by outside auditors or regulators;
* With necessary third parties in connection with, or during negotiations for, a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets;
* With social media companies when you choose to interact with us through those companies as information about your account may be discussed during those interactions;
* If you are referred to TracFone by your Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), we share your mobile number with the HMO provider. and
* With your consent.

_Walmart Family Mobile Customers_. If you are a Walmart Family Mobile customer, we work with Walmart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart") to offer the Walmart Family Mobile service. Any information you provide directly to Walmart will be subject to Walmart's Privacy Policy, not this one. This includes information you provide to Walmart in connection with your device purchase, upgrade, return, or replacement, whether in its stores, by phone or online, including but not limited to, if you purchase a Family Mobile device or obtain technical support for the device at or from Walmart or its agents. In addition, if you activate Walmart Family Mobile communications services at a Walmart store, Walmart may request personal information from you that is passed to TracFone as part of the activation process, but which may also be retained by Walmart.

Information from your web session, including your device serial number, phone number, and account email may be associated with your responses when you use these tools. This information is used by TracFone exclusively for analysis of survey or feedback results and will not be shared with any third party for any other purposes.

_Cookies and Web Technology on Our Websites._ We allow certain third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our sites and in our apps, or may send information to them. They can use this information to help us provide more relevant advertising on our own and other sites and apps. These companies may combine other information from our sites with similar information they collect on other sites to determine whether you fit into an audience that advertisers, including TracFone, are trying to reach. We and these companies use cookies, pixels, tags, web beacons, scripts, application program interfaces (APIs) or similar technology platforms on our pages and the browsers you use and may access advertising identifiers from your mobile device operating systems. Our customers and website visitors can limit the sale and sharing of personal information as well as the use of this information for certain types of targeted advertising. Please visit the “Your choices about how information is used” section of this policy to learn how to opt out.

TracFone sites and services may also include social networks or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets.

### **How We Secure and Retain Personal Information**

We use administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against the unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. In addition, we train our employees on the importance of privacy and security, as well as the proper ways to access, use and disclose customer information. Our practices and policies prohibit employees with whom we share this information from using sensitive information unless they are authorized to do so and have a business need.

We retain personal information as long as it is needed for business, tax, audit, investigative, security and/or legal purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records, not always by distinct data elements. For example, your name may be part of your account, billing, technical support and call detail records.

Although we strive to keep information secure, we can’t guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. If you become aware of a security issue, please contact us at privacy@tracfone.com.

### **Links to Other Websites**

_Third-Party Links_. Our websites may contain links to other websites that are not owned, operated, or controlled by us. Any personal information collected by such third-party websites is not governed by this Policy. We recommend that you examine the privacy policies of such third-party websites prior to submitting any personal information.

Advertisements may appear on pages throughout our websites. Some advertisements may request information directly from you or provide links to take you to websites that may request personal information. We have no control over these advertisers' privacy policies, so we encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company advertising on our websites prior to submitting any personal information.

_Third-Party Websites_. In some instances, our websites’ content is also featured on other websites with differing or non-existent privacy policies. These websites may collect personal information from website visitors that may or may not be used in conjunction with our website information. Prior to supplying personal information to any third-party company linking to our website, please read and understand their privacy policies.

### **Policy Regarding Information Obtained from Children**

Our websites are not structured to attract children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information, directly or passively, from children under the age of 18. Ordering online products and services from TracFone is limited to adults (ages 18+). Of course, wireless devices and services purchased for family use may be used by minors without our knowledge. If that happens, any information collected from the usage will appear to be the personal information of the adult subscriber and treated as such under this Policy.

### **Public Forums/Blogs**

Our websites may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. You should not provide personally identifiable information in any publicly accessible blog or community forum.

To request removal of personal information from our blogs and forums, contact us at privacy@tracfone.com, and we will do our best to comply with the request. In some cases, we may not be able to remove personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### **Refer-A-Friend**

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our websites, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address and automatically generate a one-time email to send your friend inviting them to visit the site. If you use the “Import Contacts” feature, we may collect your friends’ names and addresses in order to administer TracFone’s Refer-A-Friend program. We do not store your friend's information or use it for any other purpose.

### **Gift Purchases**

If you purchase a gift, we will ask you for the recipient’s name and mailing address in order to ship the product to the individual. We do not retain the recipient’s information or use it for any other purpose.

### **How Customers and Visitors Can Access and Update Personal Information**

You can verify your account and manage personal information, including deleting or changing certain personal information, by logging into your account on our website and going to the account profile or account information section.

If you are unable to log into your account, please contact a customer care agent by calling 1-800-867-7183. All requests for changes or deletion of account information require account verification by answering security questions or providing the Personal Identification Number (PIN) you set when you first activated your account.

In certain circumstances we may be required by law to retain personal information, or may need to retain personal information in order to continue providing a service.

### **California Privacy Rights**

The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, gives you specific rights as a California resident. The law provides you with the right to know what information we collect about you and how we use it; to access, delete, and correct that information within certain limitations; to tell us not to sell or share personal information about you; to limit the use of certain sensitive personal information; and to not be discriminated against for invoking these rights.

**Your Right to Know**
----------------------

We describe the personal information we collect and how we use it in this Privacy Policy. As detailed above in “How We Collect Personal Information,” we collect information from you when you interact with us and use our products and services.

Depending on what products and services you use and how you interact with us, we may collect these categories of personal information, some of which may be considered sensitive personal information under California law:

* Other information that may identify, relate to, describe, or is capable of being associated with you.

Our policies require that we retain records for as long they are needed for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and/or security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records, not always by distinct data elements. For example, your name could be part of your customer account record, transaction record, or call records. Each type of record may be retained for a different time period depending on its purpose. We have established criteria for how long to keep different types of records.

We, and our affiliates, use the information we collect for business and commercial purposes as defined by the CCPA. Business and commercial purposes include providing services to you; communicating with you and providing customer service; personalizing your experiences; improving our services; providing marketing and advertising; debugging; auditing our processes and services; short-term transient uses; research; and security, fraud, and legal compliance purposes.

Service providers may use information for the same purposes, as necessary for them to perform work for us (including in the last twelve months). Service providers are required to protect the information we share with them or they collect on our behalf and use it only for the specific purposes that we allow. We may also disclose information to third parties, such as partners and to law enforcement, among others, as detailed elsewhere in this policy.

We share information that identifies you with a partner who facilitates your interactions with third parties, including for verifying your identity and providing information to assist with a decision on a credit application you have submitted to a bank or other third party.

We also allow select third parties to directly collect information about your activity on our websites and in our apps using cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons, social network plugins and similar technologies to inform our and others’ cross contextual advertising. These activities may be considered selling or sharing personal information under California law. For information about how to opt out of these activities, and to learn more about TracFone’s selling and sharing activities, please visit our “Your Privacy Choices” pages linked in the “Your Right to Opt Out of Selling and Sharing Personal Information” section below. We do not knowingly sell or share personal information related to children under 16 years of age.

Some of the information that we collect is Sensitive Personal Information under California Law. California law defines sensitive personal information as:

* Information that reveals your Social Security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number;
* Account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account;
* Precise geolocation;
* Racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership;
* Contents of your mail, email and text messages unless we are the intended recipient of the communication;
* Genetic data;
* Using biometric information to uniquely identify a consumer; and
* Collecting and analyzing personal information about your health, sex life or sexual orientation.

We do not use, sell, share, or disclose sensitive personal information for any purpose other than to provide the goods or services requested by you, with your consent, or for other purposes expressly authorized by California law, such as to detect security incidents.

**Your Right to Access and Correct Information**
------------------------------------------------

You have the right to request access to specific pieces and categories of personal information we collect about you. You may submit these requests as described below under “How to Submit Your Privacy Rights Request.” We will honor at least two access rights requests every twelve months as required by California law. To the extent technically feasible, we will provide this information to you in a portable and readily usable format. You also can request that we correct inaccurate personal information we have about you.

**Your Right to Delete**
------------------------

You have the right to request that we delete personal information we have about you. We are unable to delete information that is necessary to provide you ongoing service, for security purposes, that we are contractually obligated to retain, or that is necessary to comply with legal obligations. You or your authorized agent may submit a request to delete. Instructions on how to submit this request can be found below under “How to Submit Your CCPA Request.”

**Your Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Personal Information**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

California consumers have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information. The term “sale or sharing” is broadly defined to include sharing personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration and the sharing of personal information for cross contextual advertising purposes, but does not cover all sharing of personal information. We do not knowingly include the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age in this selling or sharing.

Our activities that fall under the definition of “sale or share” in the CCPA are:

* sharing information that identifies you with a partner who facilitates your interactions with third parties, including for verifying your identity and providing information to assist with a decision on a credit application you have submitted to a bank or other third party;
* using third-party advertising companies’ cookies, pixels, tags, and other web technologies on our site to collect information about your activity on our site and apps during your visit which can be used and combined with other information about you from your activity and behavior across unaffiliated websites and apps to tailor the ads you see from us and others;
* sharing consumer information to third-party advertising and social media companies to help them better target our advertising on their websites and applications and to help find other potential customers using interest segments and audiences they create from your activities across non-affiliated websites and apps; and
* using consumer information we obtain from third-parties to better customize our advertising, when that information is derived from your activities across non-affiliated sites, apps, services and businesses.

To opt out of the selling and sharing of personal information, including for identify verification and credit inquiry purposes, please visit our Your Privacy Choices pages, available at:
