==============

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit https://www.worldwidehousechurch.org (the “Site”). 

**Personal Information We Collect** 

When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device. This information includes, but is not limited to, information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically collected information as “Device Collection.” 

We collect Device Collection using the following technologies: 

“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. 

“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.

We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP and/or email address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our users browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
