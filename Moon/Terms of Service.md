Introduction
------------

These Standard Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) written here shall manage your use of our Website accessible at paywithmoon.com through your account (“Account”), as well as to extensions, and apps (“Services”) managed by Moon Technologies, Inc. (“Moon,” “Company”, “us,” “we,” or “our”). These Terms extend to any products, goods, or additional services accessed via Moon. In addition to these Terms, individuals and/or entities will be bound by the terms and conditions of any other contract or agreement with the Company.  
  
These Terms will be applied fully and affect your use of Services provided by Moon Technologies, Inc. By using these Services, this Website, extension, apps and/or web apps, you agree to accept all terms and conditions written in here. You must not use these Services if you disagree with any of these Standard Terms and Conditions.  
  
Use of the Services is limited to parties that lawfully can enter into and form contracts under applicable law. For example, minors or people below 18 years old are not allowed to use these Services. By using this Website, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company, that you maintain a single Moon Account, and meet all of the eligibility requirements for any product or service you may be purchasing, including any geographic or other limitations for that product or service.

You must not use these Services or maintain a Moon Account if you disagree with any of these Standard Terms and Conditions, and if should you disagree with any adjustments made to these Terms and Conditions, this Agreement, or your Services, your sole remedy is to withdraw from the use of these Services and terminate your Moon Account.

Changes to these Terms
----------------------

We may revise and update these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

The Company’s Rights
--------------------

We reserve the right to decline to provide access to or use of the Services to any person for any reason. You acknowledge that, if any information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we reserve the right to terminate your use of the Services. The Company reserves the right to close a user’s Account or take other appropriate actions if such user violates any of these Terms in whole or in part, or engages in any conduct the Company deems inappropriate.

Interacting with the Company
----------------------------

Your use of the Services includes the ability to enter into agreements and to make transactions electronically. You acknowledge that either your using the Services or your electronic submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by and to pay for such agreements and transactions. Your agreement and intent to be bound by electronic submissions applies to all records relating to all transactions you enter into on the Services, including notices of cancellation, policies, contracts, and applications. To access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.

Accessing the Services and Account Security
-------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend these Services or this Website (and any service or material we provide on the Website) at our sole discretion and without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some or all parts of the Services.

We have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your information for improper purposes. You provide your information at your own risk.

You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for restricting access to your Moon Account and the Services from your compatible devices. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or Moon Account or any other breach of security. Notwithstanding this Agreement’s stipulation for binding arbitration, in the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account ownership, Moon will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion. Our decision (which may include termination or suspension of any Moon Account and related activities subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all parties.

Moon Credit
-----------

Moon provides Accounts in good standing with the ability to purchase, accrue and utilize Moon store credit (“Moon Credit”) held for future use. Moon Credit may be used only to purchase Services and other goods sold by Moon, and is not redeemable for cash, or goods and services from other Merchants or Vendors, unless otherwise required by law. Moon Credit is not a checking account, demand deposit account, or savings account. Once associated with a Moon Account, Moon Credit is not transferable to other Accounts, Users, or beyond Moon. Moon Credit is not insured by any government or third party. Account inactivity in excess of 12 months may result in reductions of Moon Credit balance. A user’s Moon Credit balance cannot at any time exceed $10,000 USD and top-ups cannot exceed $2,000 USD (or the equivalent in the Balance currency). Any of these limits can be reduced at any time by Moon.

Fees
----

The Company may charge certain fees associated with its Services and with underlying services or products purchased through its Services.  Where applicable, these fees will be detailed in the specific terms and conditions of the product or service with which they are associated.  Purchases made on Moon through Moon’s check-out or through a third-party payment service available at check-out may be subject to handling fees and confirmation time.  

Refunds of products or services purchased from Moon will be credited to Moon Credit, net of any transaction and handling fees, unless otherwise requested by the consumer.

Moon reserves the right to charge additional fees to mitigate against abusive behavior, including to mitigate and deter violations of these Terms and the terms of service of other companies, websites, or apps, at Moon’s discretion.

Account Suspension or Termination

The Company may deny you access to the Services, if, in the Company’s sole discretion, you fail to comply with any terms or provisions of these Terms. Likewise, the Company reserves the right to review, postpone, or cancel the acceptance or dispersal of funds to any user at our discretion. If the Company and/or its partners or suppliers become aware of possible violations, they may, in their sole discretion, initiate an investigation, suspend or terminate the Account, remove materials from their servers, issue a warning, or take other responsive action. If we determine that you have violated these Terms, or pose an unacceptable risk to us, or have provided any false, incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information, or otherwise have engaged in fraudulent or illegal or harmful conduct, we may take action against your Account, including suspending access to your Account, disabling your Account, or terminating your Account.
