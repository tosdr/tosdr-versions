These Terms extend to any products, goods, cards, or additional services accessed via Moon. In addition to these Terms, individuals and/or entities will be bound by the terms and conditions of any other contract or agreement with the Company.  
  
These Terms will be applied fully and affect your use of Services provided by Moon. By using these Services, this Website, extension, apps and/or web apps, you agree to accept all terms and conditions written in here. You must not use these Services if you disagree with any of these Standard Terms and Conditions.  
  
Use of the Services is limited to parties that lawfully can enter into and form contracts under applicable law. For example, minors or people below 18 years old are not allowed to use these Services. By using this Website, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company, that you maintain a single Moon Account, and meet all of the eligibility requirements for any product or service you may be purchasing, including any geographic or other limitations for that product or service.

You must not use these Services or maintain a Moon Account if you disagree with any of these Standard Terms and Conditions, and if should you disagree with any adjustments made to these Terms and Conditions, this Agreement, or our Services, your sole remedy is to withdraw from the use of these Services and terminate your Moon Account. We reserve the right to refuse access to the Services or cancel your Account at any time for any reason.

Changes to these Terms
----------------------

We may revise and update these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

The Company’s Rights
--------------------

We reserve the right to decline to provide access to or use of the Services to any person for any reason, at any time, with or without cause, and without prior notice to you. We may terminate any Service in whole or in part at any time without prior notice to you. You acknowledge that, if any information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we reserve the right to terminate your use of the Services. The Company reserves the right to close a User’s Account or take other appropriate actions if such User violates any of these Terms in whole or in part, or engages in any conduct the Company deems inappropriate. These actions include the Company’s right to review, postpone, or cancel the acceptance or dispersal of funds to any User at our discretion.

Interacting with the Company
----------------------------

Your use of the Services includes the ability to enter into agreements and to make transactions electronically. You acknowledge that either your using the Services or your electronic submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by and to pay for such agreements and transactions. Your agreement and intent to be bound by electronic submissions applies to all records relating to all transactions you enter into on the Services, including notices of cancellation, policies, contracts, and applications. To access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.

Accessing the Services and Account Security

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend these Services or this Website (and any service or material we provide on the Website) at our sole discretion and without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some or all parts of the Services. 

We have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your information for improper purposes. You provide your information at your own risk.

You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for restricting access to your Moon Account and the Services from your compatible devices. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or Moon Account or any other breach of security. Notwithstanding this Agreement’s stipulation for binding arbitration, in the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account ownership, Moon will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion. Our decision (which may include termination or suspension of any Moon Account and related activities subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all parties.

* Making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Services.
* Ensuring that all persons who access the Services through your internet connection or your Account are aware of these Terms and comply with them.

No Third-Party Beneficiary
--------------------------

The Terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each Party, and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

Card Terms
----------

The purchase, activation or use of any cards marketed by Moon represents your acceptance of Moon’s generalized terms, as well as the underlying terms of each card which may supersede these general terms, listed below:

* Unless otherwise indicated, card products will be charged a fee upon expiry equivalent to the remaining balance on the cards
* In the event of the termination of a card program by its sponsor, whether a merchant or financial institution, the card products will be charged a fee upon termination equivalent to the remaining balance on the cards

Moon Credit
-----------

Moon provides Accounts in good standing with the ability to purchase, accrue and utilize Moon store credit (“Moon Credit”) held for future use. Moon Credit may be used only to purchase Services and other goods sold by Moon, and is not redeemable for cash, or goods and services from other Merchants or Vendors, unless otherwise required by law. Moon Credit is not a checking account, demand deposit account, or savings account. Once associated with a Moon Account, Moon Credit is not transferable to other Accounts, Users, or beyond Moon. Moon Credit is not insured by any government or third party. Certain thresholds may apply to your Moon Credit balance as well as top-ups. These thresholds may not be exceeded without express written approval from Moon. Any of these limits can be reduced at any time by Moon, and the program may be terminated as a whole or for any Account at any time by Moon, at its sole discretion.

You forfeit your right to access Moon Credit when your Account breaches these Terms, or when it is determined by Moon based on industry standard methods to have engaged in fraudulent or abusive activity.

Fees
----

The Company may charge certain fees associated with its Services and with underlying services or products purchased through its Services.  Where applicable, these fees will be detailed in the specific terms and conditions of the product or service with which they are associated.  

Purchases made on Moon through Moon’s check-out or through a third-party payment service available at check-out may be subject to handling fees and confirmation time.  Moon may charge a purchase handling fee for the purchase of Moon Credit, or the use of Moon Credit for purchases of Services or products.

While many purchases on Moon are non-refundable, for those purchases which are refundable, Moon may charge a fee on outbound refunds to the original form of payment in order to cover the costs of remitting such refund payments.

Moon reserves the right to charge additional fees to mitigate against abusive behavior, including to mitigate and deter violations of these Terms and the terms of service of other companies, websites, or apps, at Moon’s discretion.

Returns and Refunds
-------------------

The Fees you pay are non-refundable. You are responsible for paying all applicable Fees whether or not you actually used or otherwise benefited from the Service.

Not all products and services offered by Moon are eligible for refund. Although we strive to present updated terms and conditions for all products, we do not make any representation in that regard. You should confirm the applicable terms and conditions of the product you are purchasing from us directly on the website of the issuer of each product. Furthermore, some products sold are geographically limited to certain countries. In these cases, if you are attempting to purchase from a country that is not allowed by a product’s terms and conditions, such a purchase will not be possible. If you circumvent our geoblocking systems to acquire a product that is not available in your country, you are violating these Terms and we may suspend or terminate your Account. We are also not liable for any redemption issues you may find, and we will not provide a refund in those cases.

Any value contained in Moon Credit or a Moon card will not in any case be redeemable in cash or refunded in fiat currency. All purchases made using fiat currency, whether utilizing credit or debit cards, ACH or direct bank transfer, or otherwise, are final and non-refundable and do not qualify as such for refunds.

Refunds of qualifying products or services purchased from Moon using virtual or digital currency will in general practice be credited to Moon Credit, net of any transaction and handling fees. Any such qualifying and requested refunds not credited to Moon Credit will be approved on a case by case basis and, if approved, made to the original form of payment, net of any transaction and handling fees. Such requested refunds to the original form of payment, if approved, will be valid for 30 days from the date of approval by Moon. If within those 30 days the User has not accurately confirmed key details for their original form of payment, the refund will be terminated and may not be re-attempted.

Account Suspension or Termination
---------------------------------

You may request to close your account at any time by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://paywithmoon.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We may close your account at any time for any reason or no reason without prior notice. The Company may also deny you access to all the Services, or any part of the Services, if, judged in the Company’s sole discretion, you fail to comply with any terms or provisions of these Terms. Furthermore, the Company reserves the right to review, postpone, or cancel the acceptance or dispersal of funds to any suspended or terminated user or account at our discretion. If the Company and/or its partners or suppliers become aware of possible violations to these Terms or to any law, they may, in their sole discretion, initiate an investigation, suspend or terminate the Account, remove materials from their servers, issue a warning, or take other responsive action. If we determine that you have violated these Terms, or pose an unacceptable risk to us, or have provided any false, incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information, or otherwise have engaged in fraudulent or illegal or harmful conduct, we may take further action.
