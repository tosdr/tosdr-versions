General Information; Governing Law
----------------------------------

The Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Pearson, govern your use of the Services, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Pearson concerning the Services. You also may be subject to additional terms, conditions, and policies that may apply when you access, purchase, or use other Pearson or third-party products and services, affiliated services, third-party content, or third-party software. The Terms of Use and the relationship between you and Pearson will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Pearson agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the County of New York, State of New York. The failure of Pearson to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or the Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use or to respond to a breach by you or other parties in no way constitutes a waiver of our right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of these Terms of Use or to act with respect to similar breaches. If a provision of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason, that provision will be deemed severable and must be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the intention of the parties. The validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions will not be affected. Those provisions will remain in full force and effect.
