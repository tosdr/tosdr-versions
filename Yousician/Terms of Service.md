Fees charged may be one-time payments or automatically renewing payments as described in more detail in the respective Services. By choosing to access and/or buying or subscribing to Paid Content, you authorize us to charge your credit card or other approved payment method for all the costs and charges that apply to such Paid Content. You are responsible for all applicable fees and charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all subscriptions and purchases made by you or through you or by anyone that has used your Account(s).¬†  
  
Please note that we may use a third-party payment processor to facilitate payments in the Services. If you make a purchase through a third-party application store, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, your purchase will be subject to such third party‚Äôs applicable payment policy.  
  
**PAYMENT INFORMATION**  
  
To access Paid Content of the Services, you must provide valid and accepted payment information.

You will get access to Paid Content as soon as the initial payment has been processed.  
  
**TRIALS**  
  
When you subscribe for Paid Content, we may from time to time offer a trial period (‚Äú**Trial Period**‚Äù) without payment or at a reduced rate. This may vary depending on promotions, type of subscription and the term you select at the time of purchase. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial Period and may cancel or change the Trial Period at any time without notice and liability within the limits permitted by applicable law.¬†  
  
We may require you to provide your valid payment information to start the Trial Period.

If you do not want to be charged, you must cancel your subscription to such Paid Content before the end of the Trial Period. If you cancel your subscription to Paid Content, your Account will only have access to those parts of our Services that you may access for free.

The subscription fee for our auto-renewable subscription plans may be billed as one-time advance payment for the subscribed period (_e.g._ 1, 3, 6 or 12 months) or in monthly installments charged every month in advance for the duration of the subscription period. The pricing and terms applicable to your subscription may vary depending on promotions, type of subscription and the subscription period you select at the time of purchase.  
  
If your subscription started with a promotion or trial at a reduced rate, your renewal rate may be higher than your initial rate.¬†  
  
In some cases, your payment billing dates or billing term of your subscription may change if your payment has not successfully settled on the original due date. We will inform you of the billing term change through email.  
  
If you choose to sign up for an auto-renewable subscription for Paid Content, you understand that and authorize that your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period and that payment for the renewal period is automatically charged from you using the payment information you have provided, unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period.

If you purchased a paid subscription via a third party, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, you can cancel the paid subscription via such third party following the applicable terms and payment policies of such third party.  
  
Unless prohibited by applicable law and except as specifically provided otherwise, any payments are always FINAL and NON-REFUNDABLE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR DISCLAIMERS SUCH AS THOSE SET FORTH ABOVE. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND, THEREFORE, THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS SHALL APPLY SOLELY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTIONS.  
  
Please note that if you are based in the EEA, you are provided with certain legal guarantees which cover the Services which we provide. Under this guarantee, Yousician may be liable for a lack of conformity of the Services, as provided under the applicable law, and which you discover: (i) within a period of two years from any one-time supply of the Services, or (ii) at any time during any continuous supply of the Services.  
  
**12\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**  
  
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOUSICIAN SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES OR INJURIES IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOST PROFITS, DEVICE FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND WHETHER OR NOT YOUSICIAN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANYTHING TO YOUSICIAN DURING SUCH TIME PERIOD, YOUR SOLE REMEDY (AND YOUSICIAN‚ÄôS EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY) FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH YOUSICIAN IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICE AND CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.  
  
Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability such as those stated above; thus, the above terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing limitations of liability shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions.  
  
BY ACCESSING THE SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED.

YOUSICIAN RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE ANY ACCOUNT THAT HAS BEEN INACTIVE FOR 180 DAYS AND HAS NO ACTIVE PAID SUBSCRIPTION.  
  
Yousician reserves the right to discontinue or cease to support the Services, Service Content or parts thereof at any time, at which point your license to use such Services, Service Content or parts thereof will be automatically terminated.

Where necessary, Yousician will use reasonable efforts to provide reasonable advance notice when we discontinue any Services, Services Content or a part thereof.  
  
Upon termination for any reason, you must cease all use of the Services. Your termination for any reason shall not release you from any liabilities or obligations set forth in the Agreement which (a) have expressly been stated as surviving any such termination or expiration, or (b) remain to be performed, or by their nature would be intended to be applicable following any such termination or expiration.

Yousician‚Äôs failure to enforce any right or provision of the Agreement shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or waiver of such right or provision in the future.¬†
