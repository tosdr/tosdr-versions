Fees charged may be one-time payments or automatically renewing payments as described in more detail in the respective Services. By choosing to access and/or buying or subscribing to Paid Content, you authorize us to charge your credit card or other approved payment method for all the costs and charges that apply to such Paid Content. You are responsible for all applicable fees and charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all subscriptions and purchases made by you or through you or by anyone that has used your Account(s).   
  
Please note that we may use a third-party payment processor to facilitate payments in the Services. If you make a purchase through a third-party application store, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, your purchase will be subject to such third party’s applicable payment policy.  
  
**PAYMENT INFORMATION**  
  
To access Paid Content of the Services, you must provide valid and accepted payment information. If the payment information provided by you is declined for payment of the Paid Content you are subscribed to, you must provide us with new valid payment information or your access to Paid Content may be suspended. You will get access to Paid Content as soon as the initial payment has been processed.  
  
**TRIALS**  
  
When you subscribe for Paid Content, we may from time to time offer a trial period (“**Trial Period**”) without payment or at a reduced rate. This may vary depending on promotions, type of subscription and the term you select at the time of purchase. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial Period and may cancel or change the Trial Period at any time without notice and liability within the limits permitted by applicable law.   
  
We may require you to provide your valid payment information to start the Trial Period. By providing this information, you agree that, unless you cancel your paid subscription prior to the end of the Trial Period, we may automatically begin charging you for such Paid Content you subscribed to on the first day after the end of the Trial Period on a monthly or other recurring basis notified to you, until you cancel your subscription to Paid Content (e.g. turn off automatic renewal from your account settings or via the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store). If you do not want to be charged, you must cancel your subscription to such Paid Content before the end of the Trial Period. If you cancel your subscription to Paid Content, your Account will only have access to those parts of our Services that you may access for free.  
  
**BILLING, RENEWALS AND CANCELLATIONS**  
  
The subscription fee for our auto-renewable subscription plans may be billed as one-time advance payment for the subscribed period (_e.g._ 1, 3, 6 or 12 months) or in monthly installments charged every month in advance for the duration of the subscription period. The pricing and terms applicable to your subscription may vary depending on promotions, type of subscription and the subscription period you select at the time of purchase.  
  
If your subscription started with a promotion or trial at a reduced rate, your renewal rate may be higher than your initial rate.   
  
In some cases, your payment billing dates or billing term of your subscription may change if your payment has not successfully settled on the original due date. We will inform you of the billing term change through email.  
  
If you choose to sign up for an auto-renewable subscription for Paid Content, you understand that and authorize that your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period and that payment for the renewal period is automatically charged from you using the payment information you have provided, unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. You can cancel your auto-renewing subscription to Paid Content purchased from our site from your account settings or by contacting our support. If you purchased a paid subscription via a third party, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, you can cancel the paid subscription via such third party following the applicable terms and payment policies of such third party.  
  
Unless prohibited by applicable law and except as specifically provided otherwise, any payments are always FINAL and NON-REFUNDABLE.

**11\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES**  
  
THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, AT YOUR OWN RISK, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT ANY MATERIAL, CONTENT, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DISPLAYED ON OR OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, APPROPRIATE, RELIABLE, OR TIMELY. WE ALSO MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS AND/OR YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, FREE OF VIRUSES, MALICIOUS CODE, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR OTHERWISE SECURE.   
  
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR DISCLAIMERS SUCH AS THOSE SET FORTH ABOVE. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND, THEREFORE, THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS SHALL APPLY SOLELY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTIONS.  
  
Please note that if you are based in the EEA, you are provided with certain legal guarantees which cover the Services which we provide. Under this guarantee, Yousician may be liable for a lack of conformity of the Services, as provided under the applicable law, and which you discover: (i) within a period of two years from any one-time supply of the Services, or (ii) at any time during any continuous supply of the Services.  
  
**12\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**  
  
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOUSICIAN SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES OR INJURIES IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, PERSONAL INJURIES, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOST PROFITS, DEVICE FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND WHETHER OR NOT YOUSICIAN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU FURTHER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUSICIAN IS NOT LIABLE, AND YOU AGREE NOT TO SEEK TO HOLD YOUSICIAN LIABLE, FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES AND OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES, AND THAT THE RISK OF THE SERVICES AND EXTERNAL SITES AND OF INJURY FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL YOUSICIAN BE LIABLE TO YOU, COLLECTIVELY, FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO YOUSICIAN IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT A CLAIM. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANYTHING TO YOUSICIAN DURING SUCH TIME PERIOD, YOUR SOLE REMEDY (AND YOUSICIAN’S EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY) FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH YOUSICIAN IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICE AND CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.  
  
Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability such as those stated above; thus, the above terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing limitations of liability shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions.  
  
BY ACCESSING THE SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DISCLAIMERS, LIMITATIONS AND WAIVERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN WILL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT(S), AGREEMENT OR ANY SERVICES.  
  
**13\. INDEMNIFICATION**  
  
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Yousician, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, representatives, and third party providers to the Services from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising from, incurred as a result of, or in any manner related to any claim or action based upon (a) your breach of, or failure to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) your use of the Services, and/or (c) the use of the Services by any other person using your Login Information. The provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your account(s) or the Services.  
  
**14\. FORCE MAJEURE**  
  
Yousician shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Yousician, including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Yousician’s control such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.  
  
**15\. TERMINATION**   
  
You may terminate this Agreement by deleting your Account and thereafter by ceasing to use the Services. If you have any subscription, and terminate this Agreement before the end of your subscription, you will not receive any refunds for any unexpired period of your subscription, unless prohibited by applicable law.  
  
WITHOUT LIMITING OUR OTHER REMEDIES, YOUSICIAN MAY LIMIT, SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE ACCOUNTS OR ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT AND/OR THE SERVICES OR PORTIONS THEREOF AND/OR TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND TAKE TECHNICAL AND LEGAL STEPS TO PREVENT YOU FROM ACCESSING THE SERVICES, AT ANY TIME WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, IF (I) YOU ARE DEEMED TO BE A REPEAT INFRINGER AS DESCRIBED ABOVE; (II) WE BELIEVE YOU TO BE, IN ANY WAY, IN BREACH OF ANY PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THESE TERMS OR RELATED POLICIES OR GUIDELINES OR THEIR LETTER OF SPIRIT; (III) YOUSICIAN ELECTS AT ITS DISCRETION TO CEASE PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE YOU RESIDE OR FROM WHERE YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS THE SERVICES; OR (IV) IN OTHER REASONABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AS DETERMINED BY YOUSICIAN AT ITS DISCRETION.  
  
YOUSICIAN RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE ANY ACCOUNT THAT HAS BEEN INACTIVE FOR 180 DAYS AND HAS NO ACTIVE PAID SUBSCRIPTION.  
  
Yousician reserves the right to discontinue or cease to support the Services, Service Content or parts thereof at any time, at which point your license to use such Services, Service Content or parts thereof will be automatically terminated. In such an event, and unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Yousician shall not be required to provide refunds, benefits or other compensation to users in connection with such discontinued Services. Where necessary, Yousician will use reasonable efforts to provide reasonable advance notice when we discontinue any Services, Services Content or a part thereof.  
  
Upon termination for any reason, you must cease all use of the Services. Your termination for any reason shall not release you from any liabilities or obligations set forth in the Agreement which (a) have expressly been stated as surviving any such termination or expiration, or (b) remain to be performed, or by their nature would be intended to be applicable following any such termination or expiration.  
  
**16\. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION**  
  
If a dispute arises between you and Yousician, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly through our support site [https://support.yousician.com/](https://support.yousician.com/) and seek resolution.  
  
If you are a United States resident, the laws of the State of New York without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions, will govern this Agreement and you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Yousician must be resolved exclusively by a court located in the State of New York. If you are a resident of a country other than the United States, the laws of Finland, without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions, will govern this Agreement and you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Yousician must be resolved exclusively by a court located in Helsinki, Finland. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST YOUSICIAN ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  
  
**17\. ASSIGNMENT, SEVERABILITY AND ENTIRE AGREEMENT**  
  
Yousician may assign the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Agreement without Yousician’s prior written consent and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is ineffective.  
  
If any provision of the Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.   
  
Yousician’s failure to enforce any right or provision of the Agreement shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or waiver of such right or provision in the future.   
  
The Agreement sets out the entire agreement between you and Yousician regarding the Services and supersedes all earlier agreements and understandings between you and Yousician.  
  
**18\.** **APPLE-SPECIFIC TERMS**
