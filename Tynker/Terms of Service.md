Additional Terms of Use for Tynker Live Classes
-----------------------------------------------

Effective Date: September 1, 2023

Welcome to **Tynker Live Classes** which is operated and owned by Neuron Fuel, Inc. and its related entities or body corporates (“**Tynker**”, “**us**”, “**we**” and “**our**”).

Your use of the Tynker Live Class Services is governed by the Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, and these Additional Terms of Use for Tynker Live Classes (“**Additional Terms**”) (collectively, “**Agreement**”). We recommend that you read all three documents before using such Live Class Services as they represent your agreement with Tynker with respect to your child(ren) attending one or more Tynker Live Classes.  You agree to abide and be bound by, and become a party to, these Additional Terms.

When you read these Additional Terms, you will come across certain capitalized terms. The capitalized terms which are not defined in these additional terms, will have the same meaning as set out in the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or comments regarding these Additional Term, please contact us at [liveclass@tynker.com](mailto:liveclass@tynker.com).

Our Tynker Live Classes are delivered by our Business Affiliate BYJU’S Future School. Here is a link to their [Terms](https://code.byjusfutureschool.com/terms-conditions) and [Privacy Policy](https://code.byjusfutureschool.com/privacy-policy).

The Tynker Live Classes are taught by independent professionals who have been selected by BYJU’s FutureSchool (“**Business Affiliate**”) to teach based on their experience and upon completing our selection process (“**Instructors**”). You understand that when you enroll your child to take our Live Classes, we will share the child’s name with the Instructor for purposes of teaching. By enrolling in or otherwise joining the Live Classes, you grant us permission to share the child’s information with the Instructor. Instructors are required to respect the privacy of all users. Instructors may only use such information to communicate with you or the child for purposes of class-facilitated transactions. Instructors may not use such information for any other purpose, such as sending unsolicited commercial messages or unauthorized transactions.

1. **Tynker Live Classes**
    1. The classes offered under the Tynker Live Class Services (_defined below_) are as follows:
        
        1. Tynker group classes wherein live classes are taken by Instructors for a group of children comprising of various fixed term courses as per the specified schedule (“**Group Classes**”); and
        2. Tynker private 1:1 classes which maybe in the form of (i) live 1:1 private-classes with a dedicated Instructor; or (ii) an offline interactive class with a designated personal  Instructor who will assign lessons offline to the Student, review Student’s work, answer technical coding questions by the student asynchronously on Tynker Platform (not live), and periodically have live catch up sessions with the student (both (i) and (ii) are collectively referred to as “Private Live Classes”).
        
        The Group Live Classes and the Private Live Classes are collectively referred to as “**Classes**”.
        
    2. The Tynker Live Classes comprise of the following (collectively “Live Class Services”):
        1. making the online platform (“Platform”) available to users that allows Parents and Instructors to connect in order to avail or provide the Classes to students subscribing for such Classes (“**Students**”);
        2. carrying out periodic assessments of the Students; and
        3. providing such other support services as may be necessary from time to time.
    3. In order to avail the Live Classes, you need to create an account with Tynker for the Student as per the Tynker Terms of Use (which may be free of cost or on paid basis) and enroll for the selected Live Classes.  In case you are already a registered user of Tynker and availing Tynker Home Courses, you can use the same account to enroll for the Tynker Live Classes. During enrollment, you (as a Parent) must also provide us a valid email id of either of the Parents or the Student’s appointed guardian for communication purposes so that we can send the confirmation of the enrollment, updates and links to classes and schedules from time to time. In order to provide the Classes, the Instructors also need to register themselves as an Instructor on the Platform. You may use the Live Classes only in accordance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.  Please note that for the Live Classes, the Students will have access to the courses only during the Live Classes and for any homework assigned by the Instructors. The courses designed for the Tynker Live Classes are unique and are different than the Home Courses available on the Platform to other Tynker users. Subscription to the Tynker Live Classes DOES NOT enable you to access the Home Courses or vice versa. You agree that Tynker and its Business Affiliate exclusively retain all ownership rights in the course content.
    4. As a Parent, you should select the classes that best suit the needs of your child(ren) based on your schedule, cost, and any other factors pertinent to you and your child(ren). We encourage you to share your preferences and special needs of the Students, if any, with us at the time of registration or soon thereafter so that we can select the best suited Instructor matching the Student’s needs.
        
        Upon commencement of the Private 1:1 Live Classes, the designated Instructor will assess the Student’s capability for the selected Class based on student’s age, interest and experience levels, and may suggest modification to the level chosen by the Parent, as the Instructor deems fit in the Student’s best interest.
        
    5. The Live Classes may be modified or discontinued in whole or in part of the Classes, the underlying curriculum, or place general limitations and restrictions on the Services related to Classes. Such modification or discontinuation of the Classes or related Services may be temporary, or permanent. Where such changes or limitations to the Classes adversely affect you, Tynker will try to bring these to your prior attention. However, a prior notice may not always be possible or practical, in which case we retain the right to make these changes without notice or liability of any kind.
2. **Recordings**
    1. **Recording of the Classes and ownership rights**
        
        Live Classes may be monitored and recorded, and you explicitly consent and grant permission to us and our Business Affiliate to (a) make videos or audio/sound recordings of, and to take screenshots during, any Live Classes, parent-teacher sessions, lectures, discussions and conversations, presentations, or similar activities, or to the extent required to improve the services, including for training and quality assurance purposes (collectively, “**Recordings**”); and (b) monitor live and recorded Live Classes in order to assess and audit the Instructor’s performance, for training and quality assurance purposes, and as otherwise required to provide the Services. The Recordings may be used for any lawful purpose. Parents are not permitted to record any Classes. Tynker and its Business Affiliate retains all ownership rights in the Recordings.
