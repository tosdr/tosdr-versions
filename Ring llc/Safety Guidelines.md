Why Ring Needs a Verification Code When Signing In
==================================================

Learn more about verification codes and why Ring requires them for signing in.

An extra layer of account security
==================================

When you sign in to Ring, we require you to enter your password and a 6-digit verification code. These two account security "steps" help us verify your identity, or Two-Step Verification.

Verification code requirements
==============================

When creating your Ring account, Ring offers you two options for how to receive your verification code: by text message to a phone number you provide, or you can generate a code in an authenticator app on a device you enroll in your Ring account.

**Verification** **codes by text message**

With this option, we'll send you a text with a 6-digit code to the phone number you provide, after entering your password. Enter that code, and you're in.

* This code expires after 10 minutes
    
* You can request to resend a code after 60 seconds during sign in if you didn't receive it

**Verification** **codes generated by an authenticator app**

With this option, you must open the authenticator app on a device you enroll to retrieve a 6-digit code each time you sign-in to Ring. We'll request this code after you enter your password.

* This code regenerates every 30-60 seconds
    
* You can only retrieve the code from your enrolled device

Troubleshooting your sign-in to Ring
====================================

If you're having trouble receiving a verification code by text message or authenticator app, you can use an alternate method to verify your account. [Learn more](https://support.ring.com/support/articles/q2eak/Getting-Your-Verification-Code)
