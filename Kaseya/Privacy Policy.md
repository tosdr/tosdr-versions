Kaseya Privacy Statement

### 1\. Overview

Kaseya, its affiliates and group partner companies (including those entities listed in Appendix A) (“we”, “us”, or “our”) recognize the need for protection and management of your information. We have therefore adopted this Privacy Statement to assist you in understanding what information we collect and how that information is used and shared. This Privacy Statement applies to the information we collect when you access any of the Kaseya websites that reference or link to this Privacy Statement, or when you provide any non-public information to us. If you are an employee of Kaseya, you may review the employee-specific privacy policy which can be found in your employee onboarding packet.

In many instances, the information we collect is “personal information” as that term is defined under various privacy laws.  Personal information is generally information or data that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as name, address, email address, phone number, device identifiers, and other information when linked or tied to a specific person’s device or account.

Before you access any Kaseya website, such as at [https://www.kaseya.com](https://www.kaseya.com/) (a “website”), purchase or use Kaseya Products, or provide any non- public information to us, you should review this Privacy Statement to understand our information collection and use practices.

### 2\. Information We Collect

We collect certain categories of information about you and the device that you are using, particularly when you visit our websites but also when you use or purchase Kaseya Products, when you provide us information to deliver you newsletters and other communications, when you contact us with inquiries, or when you register for a webinar.

In particular, we collect:

**Contact Information:** Contact information is information or data that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual. For example, when you access our websites or use Kaseya Products, we ask you to provide certain contact information when you create an account, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, user IDs and passwords, contact preferences, educational and employment background. If you do not wish to provide the information requested, you may not be able to proceed with the activity or receive the benefit for which the personal information is being requested.

**Payment Information:** If you purchase Kaseya Products from us, you will need to provide us with payment information. This may include billing and other transaction information, credit card numbers, or other financial information that we can use to ensure proper payment for the services you are purchasing.

**Automatically-Collected Information:** As is true of most websites and SaaS platforms, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

**Tracking and Location Information:** We may collect and/or track certain information that is derived from the use of Kaseya Products such as usage patterns, travel patterns, web site page views and traffic patterns. We may use this tracking and location information for statistical purposes to improve Kaseya Products and to help users manage their environment and infrastructure more efficiently, and in sometimes for investigative purposes.

**Mobile Device Information:** When Kaseya Products are deployed to mobile devices via a Kaseya Application installed on the device, our servers automatically record information that may include: the MAC (Media Access Controller) addresses from the network card in or used with your devices; web requests, Internet Protocol addresses, phone numbers, browser types, browser languages, the date and time of request; and other information regarding internet connection activities. In addition, the information collected and tracked depends upon the system configurations chosen by the administrator and the options enabled by the users and may include device location, device identifier and device user name; status of the mobile device SIM card; MAC addresses and device serial numbers; phone number, signal strength, cell tower, carrier, IMEI#, and other WWAN attributes; first and last name and email address of device user; device check-out/check-in; who uses which device as well as the physical status of the device at the start of a shift and then again at the end of a shift; applications loaded on the device; real-time GPS location tracking and mapping, including analysis of location data and history; or mobile device remote control, including screen capture. The administrator of the device can perform partial or complete erasure of data on user devices, including restoring the device to its factory default. The mechanisms that allow smartphones and mobile devices to be monitored run in the background of the devices. Individuals are notified that these functions may occur but may not be aware when these functions are occurring in real time.

**Kaseya Blog:** If you use our blogs or any community forum on our websites, you should be aware that any information you submit (including personal information) can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Although we are not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our blogs or community forums (or if we are unable to do so, we will tell you why), provided that you make such a request through our online portal accessible by clicking [here](https://kaseya-privacy.my.onetrust.com/webform/b96e80f8-1e37-4b9f-b6ab-d35715765e17/9257b5df-1221-4da5-8619-57ce380c4186).

**Images:** If you attend one of our live events, we may publish your image (in any form including photograph, film or livestream) on a Kaseya website, in print, via social media or other publication. We are the owner of any copyright and other intellectual property right in such images. If you upload images into our live event-related applications, we may retain, store and/or use these images.

**Telephone Calls**: From time to time, we may record phone calls for various purposes including customer service, fact confirmation and quality assurance. If you are in a jurisdiction which requires notice and opt in consent to record, we will provide a mechanism for you to do so.

**Backedup Content:**  Many Kaseya Products provide for the backup and/or storage of customer information (“Backedup Content”) as a Product feature. Backedup Content may include the personal information of customers, the clients of those customers, and the end-users of the customers and clients.  Kaseya collects Backedup Content under the direction of its customers, and often pursuant to settings and configurations in the Kaseya Products that are controlled by customers.  Kaseya has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data is found in the Backedup Content and processed by Kaseya customers.  Further, Kaseya generally is not aware of the information found in the Backedup Content. If your data is contained in Backedup Content and you no longer wish to have your data processed by Kaseya, please contact directly the customer (or client) that you interact with for removal of your information from Backedup Content. We may transfer Backedup Content to companies that help us provide our services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.

**Aggregated Data**. To better understand and service our customers, we may compile, aggregate, and anonymize personal data which we may share among our group partner companies to: improve the functionality, service, safety, and reliability of our Products; to understand and analyze use, demand, and general industry trends, and; generally for any purpose related to our business. Such aggregate information does not contain personal information and may be derived from information provided by customers, from use of Kaseya Products or from passive data collection techniques described herein.  Aggregated Data that does not include personal information may be shared with third parties; Kaseya does not sell its customers or end users’ personally identifiable information to third parties.

**Marketing Data.**  We collect marketing data when you visit our websites, when you provide it to us (for example, on the phone, in person or by webform), when you register for or attend an event or when we collect it from public databases, partners, social media sites or other third parties.  We are the controller of marketing data that we collect.  Marketing data includes your contact information and “automatic identifiers” like IP addresses, geographic locations, browser type, operating system.  We use marketing data to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected (for example, to send requested information, schedule demos, register for events and respond to questions).  We also use marketing data to send marketing material about our products and services.  We do not sell our marketing data to third parties.

**Employment Recruitment Information**.  When we are recruiting for positions within Kaseya or its affiliates, we collect data about candidates which may vary based on the nature of the position, the candidate’s location and how far in the recruiting process a person advances.  Such data may include contact information, resumes, qualifications, skills, educational history, interview notes, test or assessment results, background check results and other biographical information.  We are the controller of the data that we collect when we recruit candidates.  We collect some of this data directly from you, and also from recruiters, third-party employment sites, social media, personnel referrals, prior employers, references, Kaseya employees that you interviewed with, recruiting events and other sources.  We use this information to identify and evaluate candidates for positions within our company, to comply with our legal and compliance obligations, and to improve our recruiting practices.  We may share recruiting data among our affiliated companies and with third party service providers that help us in our recruiting efforts.

### 3\. Cookies, Beacons and Similar Tracking Technologies

**Tracking Technologies**.  Cookies, beacons, clear gifs and other similar technology (collectively, “**Cookies**”) are placed on your computer, smartphone or other device when you visit a website. Like many other website operators, Kaseya works with third-party service providers and partners (including marketing partners, customer service providers, and others) to use Cookies for a number of purposes. For example, these technologies are used in:

* Analyzing site usage trends;
