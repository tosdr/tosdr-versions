TO THE EXTENT ANY JURISDICTION DOES NOT PERMIT US TO DISCLAIM WARRANTIES IN THESE WAYS, WE DISCLAIM WARRANTIES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

**Limitation of Liability**

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU HEREBY RELEASE LEGACYBOX, TOGETHER WITH ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES, FROM ALL LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR USE OF THIS SITE AND THE SERVICES. You hereby agree that all rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code and any similar laws are expressly waived, if applicable to you. Section 1542 States: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY YOU MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

You acknowledge that you are responsible for any actions you take while on this Site or accessing or using any Services.   You recognize that your use of the Site and Services and any subsequent actions arising from your use are taken solely at your own risk.

IN NO EVENT WILL LEGACYBOX, OUR DIRECTORS, OUR OFFICERS, OUR EMPLOYEES, OUR CONTRACTORS, OUR AGENTS, OR OUR REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY OR UNDER ANY EQUITABLE THEORY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE AND THE SERVICES, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO THE SITE, ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE OR SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, CLINICAL OUTCOMES, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.  NO CAUSE OF ACTION, REGARDLESS OF FORM, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE OR THE SERVICES MAY BE BROUGHT BY YOU MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH ACTION HAS ACCRUED. 

**Indemnification**

You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Legacybox, our licensors and affiliates, and our respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, and representatives, from and against any and all claims, causes of action, demands, liabilities, losses, costs, or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising out of, in connection with, or resulting from:

1. your Materials or your access to or use of the Site and Services;
2. your violation of any of the provisions of these Terms of Use or Service Order Terms;
3. any activity related to your accessing the Services, including, without limitation, negligent or wrongful conduct; or
4. your violation of any third-party right, including, without limitation, relating to your Materials or any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property, or privacy right.

For purposes of clarity, these indemnification obligations do not apply for intellectual property infringement claims relating solely to our Site or Services independently of your Materials or our gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.

**Our compliance with COPPA**

THIS SITE AND SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USERS WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN THIRTEEN (13) YEARS OF AGE.  You can learn more about our compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) by reviewing our [**Privacy Policy**](https://legacybox.com/pages/privacy-policy-coppa)[**.**](https://legacybox.com/pages/privacy-policy-coppa)

**Force majeure**

If any loss, damage, delay, or non-performance is a result of acts of God, or natural disaster or catastrophe; pandemic, virus, plague, disease, or quarantine; war, invasion, other hostilities (including acts of terrorism), rebellion, or any other materially disruptive military or political event; embargo or labor dispute; power failures or other disruptions to services, the internet, and utilities on which Legacybox relies (including but not limited to, any outage in hosting services provided by a third-party host for Legacybox online services); or any other unforeseen and external occurrence for which Legacybox is not responsible and could not predict which is required for the performance of its obligations, then Legacybox will not be not be liable for any such loss, damage, delay, or non-performance of services to the full extent excused under applicable law.

**Non-assignable**

Your rights and obligations under these Terms of Use or relating to the Site or any Services are not assignable to any third party—neither voluntarily or by operation of law—without the prior written consent of Legacybox. Any assignment or purported delegation by you without Legacybox’s written consent will be null and void and of no force or legal effect.

**Choice of law**

These Terms of Use are governed at all times by the laws of the State of Tennessee applicable to agreements made and to be wholly performed within that state, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions or the conflict of laws provisions of any jurisdiction that would cause the application of any law other than those of the State of Tennessee.

**Arbitration & choice of forum**

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of Legacybox’s Site or Services, or your visit to the Site or access of the Services, will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court. You agree that the arbitration will occur before a single arbitrator. You also agree that both parties will be responsible for their own costs and attorney’s fees, unless the claim is frivolous, in which case attorney’s fees may be pursued.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator can, however, award the same damages and relief as a court on an individual basis, and an arbitrator will follow and apply these Terms of Use as a court would.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at Legacybox, Attn: Legal Department, 1110 Market Street, Suite 318, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 37402. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.

You agree that, if possible under all relevant rules, the arbitration will occur in the State of Tennessee, in Chattanooga, TN, or as close to it as possible. If it is not possible under all relevant rules for the arbitration to occur in Tennessee, then you agree that the arbitration may occur by telephone (which is usually cheaper and easier for both parties) or may be based on written submissions.

**Disputes as Individuals; Class Action Waiver**

You and Legacybox both agree that any dispute resolution proceedings, whether judicial or arbitrated, will be conducted only on an individual basis, and not in a class nor any other consolidated or representative action.  YOU AND WE BOTH HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE EACH OF OUR OWN RIGHT(S) TO BRING CLAIM(S) AGAINST THE OTHER AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, WHETHER A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION(S), OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING IN WHICH SOMEONE IS ACTING IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OVER MULTIPLE PARTIES.

**Merger**

This Terms of Use, together with the Privacy Policy, CCPA Policy (when applicable), Service Order Terms, and DMCA Policy (when applicable) represents the full agreement between you and Legacybox. No other representations (besides the individual price quote you are given for Legacybox’s services), whether oral or written, form any part of your agreement with Legacybox. Additionally, this Terms of Use cannot be orally modified, even by Legacybox personnel, and no provisions of it can be waived by either party except in writing.

**Severability**

If any court or other body of competent jurisdiction declares any part of this Terms of Use to be unenforceable, then that part will be deemed severed, and the enforceability of the remaining parts will not be affected. The unenforceable part will simply not be considered to be part of this Terms of Use.
