Additionally, if you choose to make a purchase on or through features on the Services, you may be required to provide your Personal Information to third parties for services such as credit card or other payment processing, order fulfillment, order tracking, and address verification. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies. You agree that we are not responsible for third parties’ processing of your Personal Information.

b. Non-Personal Information

“Non-Personal Information” means information that does not identify you, but provides insights regarding your use of the Site. For example, we collect information about your use of the Site, including but not limited to Internet connections, computer equipment, browser information, websites visited before entering and after leaving the Site, IP addresses, and other information about your use of the Site that does not identify you as a user.

You may be given the option to receive push notifications while using our Services. In order to serve push notifications, we may need to collect your IP address and a persistent identifier from your device. You can turn off push notifications in your device settings.

4\. How We Share Information
============================

We may share Personal Information with the following parties:

* Corporate affiliates, other affiliated entities, and associated entities for the purposes described in this Policy which are required to treat the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy;
* Service providers that help us administer and provide the Services (for example, a web hosting company whose services we use to host our platform). These third-party services providers have access to your Personal Information only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.  We have entered into contractual relationships with these service providers and require them to comply with all applicable information privacy laws and regulations and to use the Information only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.  We require that any third-party service providers limit their use of your Information solely to providing services to us and that they maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your Information and not make unauthorized use or disclosure of the Information;
* Authorized third parties, who are parties directly authorized by you to receive the applicable Information, such as when you authorize a third-party application provider to access your account. The use of your Information by an authorized third party is subject to the third party’s privacy policy;
* As we believe necessary: (i) under applicable law; (ii) to enforce applicable terms and conditions; (iii) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; (iv) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (v) to respond to claims that contact information (e.g. name, e-mail address, etc.) of a third-party has been posted or transmitted without their consent or as a form of harassment and (vi) to respond to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include authorities outside your country of residence; and
* Pursuant to your express consent.

5\. Information Security
========================

Legacybox uses industry standard protections for the Site, which are intended to mitigate against the loss, misuse, alteration, breach, and theft of its information and services. As needed, Legacybox may use security measures to protect its Site and online storage facilities, and that security service may be provided by a third party vendor. Legacybox reserves the right to provide information or access to any third party as it determines is necessary for security purposes.

Although we use reasonable security measures designed to protect your Information and materials, it is common knowledge that transmission of information via the Internet is not wholly secure, and we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of your Personal Information, or any other information or materials, transmitted to or through our Site or Services or otherwise provided to us.  We are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of such information.  It is your responsibility to safeguard any passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features associated with your use of the Service(s).  Any transmission of information is at your own risk. By using our Site and/or Services, you acknowledge and accept these risks.

If you have any questions about security on our Services, or if you become aware of _any unauthorized use of an account, loss of your account credentials_, or suspect a security breach, notify us immediately via email at privacy@legacybox.com.  If our security system is breached, we will notify you of the breach to the extent required under applicable law.

6\. Information Retention
=========================

We retain the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Site or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our products and services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.

7\. Links to Third Party Sites
==============================

The Site may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us.  If you click on a link to another site, you will be directed to that third party’s site.  Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, their content or services, or the persons or entities associated with those websites.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites.  We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of all third-party websites or services that you may visit.

8\. Children’s Privacy
======================

We do not sell products or services for purchase by anyone under the age of thirteen (13).  In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we will never knowingly request or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without verifiable parental consent.  In the event that we receive actual knowledge that we have collected such Personal Information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical.  We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage so that we can verify that minors are not using the Service(s).

9\. Your California Privacy Rights
==================================

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request and obtain a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.  Under Section 1798.83, California residents are entitled to request and obtain such information, by e-mailing a request to privacy@legacybox.com.  For more information regarding your privacy rights as a California resident, please see our Privacy Notice for California Residents https://legacybox.com/pages/your-california-privacy-rights.

10\. Changes in the Privacy Policy
==================================

We reserve the right to modify and update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting an amended version of the statement on our Site. Please refer to this policy regularly.  If at any time we decide to use Personal Information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you either on the panel home page of our Site or via e-mail.
