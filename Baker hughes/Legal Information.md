##### 10\. Additional Information for International Visitors to the Website 

Baker Hughes operates the bakerhughes.com and other websites from the United States and may transfer, disclose, and store your personal information in the United States, where we are headquartered, or in any other country where we or our business partners or vendors, who process data on our behalf, operate.

If you are located in the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland, we will implement appropriate measures when it is transferred outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland by processing it in a territory which the European Commission or other regulator has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information or by otherwise ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data, such as entering into the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.
