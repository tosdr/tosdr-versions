This California Privacy Section should be read in conjunction with our Privacy Notice. We have described the categories of personal information we collect, the sources from which we collect personal information, and our purposes for collection in the [“Personal Information We Collect, Why We Collect It, and How We Use It”](#_Personal_Information_We) section at the beginning of this Privacy Notice.

##### 10\. Additional Information for International Visitors to the Website 

Baker Hughes operates the bakerhughes.com and other websites from the United States and may transfer, disclose, and store your personal information in the United States, where we are headquartered, or in any other country where we or our business partners or vendors, who process data on our behalf, operate.

We take appropriate measures in compliance with applicable law to protect any personal information that we transfer to another location, including safeguards legally required to protect personal information during transfer and other processing outside the country where it was collected. 

If you are located in the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland, we will implement appropriate measures when it is transferred outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland by processing it in a territory which the European Commission or other regulator has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information or by otherwise ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data, such as entering into the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.
