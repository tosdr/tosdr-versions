WetHunt considers a "repeat infringer" to be any User or Member that has uploaded User Content to or through the Service and about whom WetHunt has received more than two takedown notices. WetHunt has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any User or Member after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or otherwise upon WetHunt’ sole and exclusive determination (without prejudice to the generality of other provisions of this Agreement).

  

a. Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.

  

If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a written "Notification of Claimed Infringement" containing the following information to the designated agent identified below. WetHunt may share your Notification of Claimed Infringement with the User or Member alleged to have infringed a right you own or control, and you consent to WetHunt making such disclosure. Your communication must include substantially the following:

  

1\. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the material(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed.

  

2\. Identification of the material allegedly being infringed, or, if multiple materials are covered by a single notification, then a representative list of such works.

  

3\. Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit WetHunt to locate the material on the Service.

  

4\. Information reasonably sufficient to permit WetHunt to contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address.

  

5\. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright or other intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law.

  

6\. Under penalty of perjury, a statement that the information in the Notification of Claimed Infringement is accurate and truthful, and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

  

You should consult with your own lawyer and/or review Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, as amended, (“DMCA”) or other applicable law regarding copyright or other intellectual property infringement to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.

  

In accordance with the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing, or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of WetHunt relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

  

b. Counter-Notification Procedure

If you have received a Notification of Claimed Infringement and believe that material on the Website was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us (the “Counter Notice”). Counter Notice must be submitted by the material’s original uploader or an agent authorised to act on their behalf.

Your Counter Notice must include substantially the following:

1.        Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address;

2.        A physical or electronic signature of a person authorised to act on behalf of the owner of the material(s) that dispute the Notification of Claimed Infringement;

3.        A description of the material that was removed and the location on the website (e.g., the URL) where it previously appeared.

4.        A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification;

Do not make false claims. Misuse of this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.

**a. Informal Dispute Resolution.** Prior to the initiation of formal dispute resolution procedures, you specifically agree to contact us at support@wethunt.com to resolve the Dispute informally, as follows:

First, you must provide a notice of the Dispute (the “Notice”) with (a) brief description of the Dispute, (b) a statement of your concerns and perspectives on the issues in Dispute, (c) a summary of supporting facts and circumstances, (d) your contact information (email, you user account credentials) and (e) other information which you deemed relevant.

Upon receipt of the Notice, the Company will submit to you a written response (the “Response”).

The parties will attempt to resolve the Dispute in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute without the necessity of any formal proceeding. In addition, to facilitate such negotiations, the parties may agree to utilize the services of a mediator whose fees will be split equally by the wethunt.com and you.

The Parties agree that any written statements, including the Response, and other documents, which will be prepared in connection with settlement, and as such will be privileged and will not be used against the Company unless it is subsequently introduced by the Company in any formal proceedings. The Parties also agree that the informal settlement will be conducted privately, amicably and confidentially.

Should the parties fail to reach agreement within 30 days after receipt of the Notice in accordance with Section 24 (a) above (or such longer period as the parties may agree in writing), then formal proceedings for the resolution of such Dispute may be commenced in accordance with Section 24 (b).

  

**b. Arbitration.** If the Parties are unable to resolve any Dispute arising under this Agreement as contemplated by Section 24 (a), then such Dispute will be submitted to mandatory and binding arbitration pursuant to the following conditions:

  

YOU AND WetHunt, AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS, AGREE TO ARBITRATION, AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE, OR THE WEBSITE, UNLESS YOU ARE LOCATED IN A JURISDICTION THAT PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF ARBITRATION FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.

  

THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") WILL EXCLUSIVELY ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE "Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

If you commence arbitration against WetHunt, you are required to provide a written notice of intent to arbitrate (the "Dispute Notice"), by an international courier with a tracking mechanism, or, in the absence of a mailing address, via any other method available, including via e-mail, to WetHunt at the Arbitration Notice Address as defined below within seven (7) days of such commencement. The Dispute Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (the "Demand").

The Dispute Notice to WetHunt must be addressed to Compliance Department of the Company at support@wethunt.com (the “Arbitration Notice Address”).

  

The Rules and AAA forms are available online at http://www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against WetHunt, then WetHunt will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon WetHunt’ receipt of the Dispute Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.

  

The arbitration shall be conducted exclusively in English. The Dispute will be resolved by a single, independent and impartial arbitrator acceptable to the parties involved in the Dispute. If the parties are unable to agree upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator within 30 days of the submission of the Dispute to arbitration, such arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the AAA Rules, as modified herein.

  

You and WetHunt agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the arbitration process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i ) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or WetHunt.

  

Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her final, confidential decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days upon a showing of good cause and in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim.

  

The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the Delaware without regard to its conflicts of laws principles in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this Section 24 in this Agreement. Any award rendered shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.

  

**c. Equitable Relief.** The foregoing provisions of this Section 24 do not apply to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such party’s copyrights, trademarks, patents , or other intellectual property. For the avoidance of doubt, you acknowledge that, in the event WetHunt or a third party breaches this Agreement, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against WetHunt, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement.

  

**d. Claims.** You and WetHunt agree that, notwithstanding any other rights a party may have at law or in equity, any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy) or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must be initiated with the AAA, filed in small claims court in Delaware as set forth, within one (1) year after the claim accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently and forever barred. This one (1) year period includes the thirty (30) day pre-dispute procedure set forth in Section 24(a) above.

  

**e. Improperly Filed Claims.** All claims you bring against WetHunt must be resolved in accordance with this Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section will be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, WetHunt may recover attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of its costs, provided that WetHunt has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you fail to promptly withdraw the claim.

  

**f. Modifications**. In the event that WetHunt makes any material change to this Arbitration provision (other than a change to WetHunt’ Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to WetHunt’ Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with WetHunt and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Section, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

**g. CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

  

YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU SPECIFICALLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AGAINST THE WetHunt IN A COURT OR IN ARBITRATION. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST WetHunt ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, you hereby confirm that arbitration claims may not be joined or consolidated in the arbitration proceeding. In no event shall the arbitrator have authority to preside over any form of representative or class proceeding or to issue any relief that applies to any person or entity other than you or WetHunt individually. If this Class Action Waiver is found to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then the entirety of this Section (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver.

  

THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THEY HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS SECTION 24 AND THAT THEY ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

**h. Enforceability.** If only the "Class Action Waiver" paragraph above or the entirety of this Section 24 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 24 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the applicable law, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 25 or Section 26 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement and/or your use of Services.

  

**25\. GOVERNING LAW**

The laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern this Agreement and your use of the Service. Your use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws. To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such action will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Delaware, and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any defense of inconvenient forum.

**26\. GOVERNING LAW FOR EU RESIDENTS**

If you are a resident of the European Union and European Economic Area, the agreement to arbitrate in Sections 24 and 25 will not apply to you. This Agreement, your use of the Website, and the relationship between you and us shall be governed by the laws of Cyprus, without regard to conflict of law rules. The United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is specifically excluded. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be in an appropriate court located in Limassol, Cyprus, and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction and venue in such courts, and waive any defense of improper venue or inconvenient forum.
