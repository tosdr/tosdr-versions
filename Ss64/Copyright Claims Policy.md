> **SS64 Interpretation of “Non-commercial”**
> 
> _Non-commercial use_ means that users may not sell, profit from, or commercialize SS64 materials or works derived from them. The guidelines below are intended to help users determine whether or not their use of SS64 materials would be permitted by SS64 under the "non-commercial" restriction. Note that there are additional requirements (attribution and share alike) spelled out in our license.
> 
> 1. **Commercialization is prohibited.** Users may _not_ directly sell or profit from SS64 materials or from works derived from SS64 materials.  
>       
>     Example: A commercial education or training business may not offer courses based on SS64 materials if students pay a fee for those courses and the business intends to profit as a result.  
>       
>     
> 2. **Determination of commercial vs. non-commercial purpose is based on the use, _not_ the user.** Materials may be used by individuals, institutions, governments, corporations, or other business whether for-profit or non-profit so long as the use itself is not a commercialization of the materials or a use that is directly intended to generate sales or profit.  
>       
>     Example: A corporation may use SS64 materials for internal professional development and training purposes.  
>       
>     Non-commercial use does not include the use of Content without prior written consent from SS64.com in connection with the development of any model, algorithm, or other generative AI tool, including, but not limited to, training or using the Content in connection with the development or operation of a machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) system (including any use of the Content for training, fine tuning, or grounding the machine learning or AI system or as part of retrieval-augmented generation.  
>       
>     
> 3. **Incidental charges to recover reasonable reproduction costs may be permitted.** Recovery of nominal actual costs for copying small amounts (under 1000 copies) of SS64 content on paper or CDs is allowed for educational purposes so long as there is no profit motive and so long as the intended use of the copies is in compliance with all license terms. Students must be informed that the materials are freely available on the SS64 Web site and that their purchase of copied materials is optional.  
>       
>     Example: An institution in a remote area has limited Internet access and limited network infrastructure on campus, and a professor offers to create CDs of SS64 materials relevant to her course. The professor may recover the costs of creating the CDs.
>

>

You may not use the Services in violation of applicable laws, including export controls and sanctions, or in violation of our or any third party’s intellectual property or other proprietary or legal rights.

> 
> Without SS64’s prior written consent, you shall not:
> 
> 1. Use the Content for the development of any model, algorithm, or generative AI tool, including, but not limited to, training or using the Content in connection with the development or operation of a machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) system (including any use of the Content for training, fine tuning, or grounding the machine learning or AI system or as part of retrieval-augmented generation).
> 2. use services, software or any manual or automatic device, tool, or process designed to circumvent any restriction, condition, or technological measure that controls access to the Services in any way, including overriding any security feature, bypassing or circumventing any access controls or use limits of the Services, or failing to abide by exclusionary protocols such as the Robots Exclusion Protocol or the Automated Content Access protocol (SS64’s robots.txt notice does not constitute SS64’s prior written consent under these Terms of Service).

Attribution
-----------

> 
> For entire pages and hard copies, just ensure the existing copyright notice (bottom right) remains in place.

> If you have questions about acceptable use of SS64 materials, please us.

Mirror Sites
------------

> While not expressly forbidden, mirror sites are not encouraged because duplicate pages on the internet tend to lower the google ranking of both sites. Of course if SS64.com were to disappear completely at some point in the future, then do 'mirror away'.
> 
> Something a number of people have done which works well (and stays up-to-date) is to save the main command list (in any web browser - File, Save as) that gives you an HTML page with all the links back to SS64.com. You can then copy the HTML into your own blog or forum.
