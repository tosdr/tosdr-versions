Privacy Policy
==============

Last modified: February, 2020.

Who We Are
----------

Mailpanion (“We”, “Our” or “Us”) collects and processes your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws. This Policy provides you with the necessary information regarding your rights and our obligations, and explains how, why and when we process your personal data.

The confidentiality and privacy of your data is very important to us and we are fully committed to protecting it. Mailpanion will never sell or rent your personal data to third parties and will only share it when necessary to maintain your account and the Mailpanion service. We are proud to say that we are one of the fighters for user privacy and service transparency.

What We Collect
---------------

Mailpanion users use Google integration features that require Mailpanion to access limited information from the Google account they provide. When these features are accessed by users and administrators, Mailpanion displays a message allowing the user to review the information that will be collected, including a link to this privacy policy, so they can choose to allow that access or cancel. The following list gives details of each Mailpanion Google integration feature, and if that feature is used, the corresponding data collected and its purpose.

* **Basic One-Time Permissions:** Obtain your name, email, and google id from Google after you authorize Mailpanion. This information will be used to register you and grant you access to the online dashboard.
* **Intercept Images in Your Emails:** As part of its integral functionality, Mailpanion automatically intercepts suspicious images in the body of emails you open a block the image from loading as needed. The content of your email is not accessed by Mailpanion. The detection and blocking feature can each be disabled by you in the settings on the dashboard.
* **Email Tracking and Tracker Blocking Statistics:** Mailpanion registers clicks on your emails and the links inside your emails and notifies you accordingly. Mailpanion stores quantitative information about interactions on your emails, such as time executed and type of action. This information is readily accessible to you. The user dashboard aggregates this information into general statistics viewable by you.
* **Tracker Links:** To improve the Mailpanion service, Mailpanion anonymously collects the links of email trackers. Email trackers are classified as single pixel images. Therefore, no sensitive data is ever collected. Tracker link collection aids the refinement of the tracker detection algorithm and will ultimately benefit you.

Only automated software uses the above permissions. No one at Mailpanion accesses your emails and your email body will never be stored. Mailpanion requires the most limited permissions from Google, so it does not and cannot send emails on your behalf, read your emails, and modify your Gmail settings. Specifically, Mailpanion does not acquire any permissions from Google to access or modify your Gmail account.
