##### Managing Your Preferences

You control the data we hold on you.  
When you register you will be given the opportunity to indicate whether or not you are happy for us to use your personal information in order to tell you about our offers, products or services. You can control the way in which we contact you by editing your marketing preferences information in the 'Manage my Preferences' section of your U Profile.

If you would like us to stop using your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, you can send us an email at [viewers@uktv.co.uk](mailto:viewers@uktv.co.uk). Please note that if you opt out of profiling and targeted advertising, this does not mean that you will receive less advertising when you use our UKTV Digital Services. This just means that the advertising you see may not be as relevant to you.

##### Where We Store Your Personal Information

Your personal information will only be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area if adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data. For example, we use processors who have signed up to European Commission approved [standard contractual clauses](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32010D0087).

In any event, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

##### How We Keep Your Personal Information Secure

We take privacy issues very seriously and we understand that keeping your personal information secure is very important to you. When handling your personal information, security is paramount and we use all reasonable measures to safeguard your information and to ensure it is adequately protected.

Our system is hosted by service providers whom we consider to have good reputations for security, but please note that we cannot guarantee that any personal information transmitted over the internet is completely secure.

### Your Rights

You have various rights with respect to our use of your personal information:

* **Access:** You have the right to request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. Please note that there are exceptions to this right, so that access may be denied if, for example, making the information available to you would reveal personal information about another person, or would reveal trade secrets, or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information. If we have deleted or anonymised your data then we won't be able to provide you with a copy of that data. If you wish to exercise this right, please contact us using the contact details provided below.
* **Accuracy:** We aim to keep your information accurate, current, and complete. We encourage you to contact us using the contact details provided below to let us know if any of your personal information is not accurate or changes, so that we can keep your personal information up-to-date. You can also review and correct/update some of your personal information by logging-in to your account and going to your Profile, if you have registered on one of the UKTV Digital Services.
* **Objecting:** In certain circumstances you also have the right to object to processing of your personal information: (i) which is based on our legitimate interests; (ii) for direct marketing purposes; and (iii) for profiling to the extent that it is related to direct marketing. If you would like to object to (i), please contact us using the contact details provided below. Please see the How We Use Your Personal Information section above for information on how to object to (ii) and (iii).
* **Erasing and Restricting:** You have the right to ask us to erase or restrict your personal information. If you would like us to stop using your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided below. Please note that there are exceptions to these rights, if, for example, we are under a legal obligation to continue to process your personal information.
* **Porting:** You have the right to request that your personal information is ported to you.
* **Complaints:** If you believe that your data protection rights may have been breached, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the country of your habitual residence, place of work or of the potential breach, or to seek a remedy through the courts. The supervisory authority in the UK is the Information Commissioner's Office, whose website at ico.org.uk provides information on how you can lodge a complaint.

When we ask you to supply us with information we will make it clear whether the information we are asking for must be supplied so that we can provide the products and services to you, or whether the supply of any information we ask for is optional. For example, registration is mandatory to use U on most platforms, and certain minimum details must be submitted in order to enter our competitions.

##### How Long We Keep Your Personal Information For

We will retain your personal information, whether or not your account is active, for as long as we reasonably believe it necessary to fulfil our business purposes or to comply with applicable law, audit requirements, regulatory requests or orders from competent courts. We will then delete or anonymise it. For example, we will normally delete or anonymise your U or UKTV Press account after 2 years of inactivity, but we will email you to warn you first.

##### Links

The UKTV Digital Services may contain links to other websites over which we have no control. We are not responsible for privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from our UKTV Digital Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your personal information.
