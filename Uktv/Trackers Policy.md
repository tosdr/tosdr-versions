Cookie Policy

Last updated: July 2024

UKTV Media Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of BBC Studios, the principal commercial arm of the British Broadcasting Corporation, operates a range of commercial websites. This notice describes how cookies and other specialist web technologies are used to support our websites and the options available to you.

To learn more about how we treat other personal data please read our [Privacy Policy](https://corporate.uktv.co.uk/legal/privacy-policy/).

### 1\. About cookies (and similar technologies)

A cookie is a small text file that is automatically sent to your device where it is stored by your web browser. The cookie stores a unique identifier (a string of random characters) so that your browser can be distinguished from others and are often used to link your browser to databases that hold data about your usage and inferred interests, along with other data such as your IP address. They are used for various functions - from enabling the website to work, by recognising the same user as they navigate from one page to another; to analysing what content is viewed and is popular, through to personalising content based on browsing behaviour and interests.

Cookies may be stored by the website you are visiting (a “first party cookie”) or by a technology provider, such as an analytics company, advertising network or social media platform (a “third party cookie”). Third party cookies may be used to link your browsing behaviour across multiple sites. Cookies are either stored for the duration of your visit (a “session cookie”) or they will remain on your device for a fixed period (usually several months, or longer) to remember you across multiple browsing sessions (a “persistent cookie”).

**Other types of storage, such as local or “HTML”storage**  
Many websites use local storage technologies that are similar to cookies but enable larger amounts of data to be stored. This means they can store information like your preferences and viewing history on your device rather than on their own systems.

**Other tracking technologies, such as pixels**  
Websites and email communications may also use embedded code to record how you interact with them (recognising your browser via the unique ID stored in their cookie or your device “AdID”). They are often used to send data about your browsing to a third party, such as a social media company or advertiser to measure engagement with their content or to personalise ads or marketing. 

**Tracking via Apps**  
Companies are unable to use cookies within Mobile Apps. Instead, they use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as the device Advertising ID (a random and resettable ID on your device), and other data such as your geo-location or your network location. This data is used in the same way as cookies, e.g. to analyse and improve services and to serve marketing and advertising to you (if the App is funded by advertising).

### 2\. How cookies are used on our services

Cookies are used for the purposes described below. The specific cookies used by a service are listed and described in the cookie management platform for that service. This is presented to you when you first visit the website, when we periodically refresh the cookies used, and/or when we periodically ask you to review your preferences. You can also load the preference centre by clicking on “Manage Cookies”, in the footer of the website.

##### Cookie Purposes

* **Essential:** these are cookies that are required to enable the effective operation of the service. For example, to enable you to navigate the service, to remember your cookie preferences, to keep our service secure and for system administration, such as preventing fraudulent or disruptive activity. Without these cookies the service may not operate as it should and so these are not optional. 
* **Performance:** these cookies are used to enable us to analyse and improve the performance of the service. For example, to help us to know how many users we have, which parts of our sites are most popular, what browsers are used (so we can maximise compatibility), the country or region where our users are located, and how long it takes for the site to load. This enables us to understand better who is using our site, and to improve and tailor our services accordingly. We might also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns (online and by email).

### 3\. Third Party Cookies

We use a few specialist companies to help us to run our services effectively and to provide marketing functionality, as described in the previous section. These technology providers use and control cookies on our services, which may be used for their own purposes, including for the purposes of tracking your browsing behaviour across multiple websites. We undertake checks to ensure that these companies keep your data secure and handle it fairly and responsibly.

Below we describe how we use the key technologies running through our services, with links to their privacy policies where you can find out more about what they do with your data. This is a list of the common technologies used to support our websites and other online services. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list. You can manage your preferences for these third party cookies via the “Manage Cookies” link in the footer of this website.

| PROVIDER | CATEGORY | PURPOSE | MORE INFO ABOUT THE PROVIDER’S USE OF YOUR DATA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### 4\. Your choices

We will ask for your prior consent for the use of cookies and other specialist technologies. We will ask for your consent again if any new types of cookies have been added to the apps and / or website.

You can manage your cookie preferences by clicking on ’Manage Cookies’ in the footer of the website.

You can also choose how cookies (across all websites) are handled on your device via your browser settings including to block or delete all cookies or just third party cookies. Each browser manufacturer is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. 

These browser settings will also only apply on the device on which you change them. If you want to control the cookies placed on your browser across all of your devices, you will need to separately change your browser settings on each device. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Be aware that if you choose not to receive cookies at any time, our UKTV Digital Services may not function properly, and certain services will not be provided. Please note that, unless you have adjusted your browser settings (as set out above) to block or limit cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our UKTV Digital Services via a browser. You should be aware that if you do delete your cookies, you will lose any preferences you have previously set.
