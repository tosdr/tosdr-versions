**THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AND LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT. PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.**  

The Terms of Use set forth herein (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of various websites, mobile application(s), kiosks, and other digital platforms (together, the “Digital Platforms”) owned, operated, licensed or controlled by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., its subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the "Company").

Supplemental terms of sale and terms of use (the “Supplemental Terms”) may apply to certain events, programs, activities or promotions, and such Supplemental Terms may be disclosed to you separately. Any Supplemental Terms and conditions are in addition to these Terms and, in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms.

  
**BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND, BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING all applicable laws and regulations (including export and re-export control laws), and PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THE “TERMS”).**

**If you do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Digital Platforms.**

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to add, modify, or delete any part of these Terms at any time. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. If you have provided us with your email address, we will notify you of any changes that are materially adverse to you by email. We may also notify you of non-material changes in our sole discretion. If you do not accept the updated Terms, you must contact us within 30 day of the notice of the change to close your account. Your keeping your account open or other continued use of the Digital Platforms constitutes your acceptance of the update. In addition, we may in our sole discretion require you to accept the updated Terms expressly in order to continue to use the Digital Platforms.

**1.              General Terms**  

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and the Company regarding your use of the Digital Platforms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

**2.              User Accounts and Registration**

In order to use most aspects of the Digital Platforms, you must register for and maintain an active personal user account (“**Account**”). You must be at least thirteen (13) years of age to obtain an Account. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you represent and warrant that you possess the legal consent of your parent or guardian to access and use the Digital Platforms.

Account registration requires you to submit to Company certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and date of birth, among others. You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, may result in your inability to access or use the Digital Platforms.   

**It is a condition of your use of the Digital Platforms that you provide user account registration details on behalf of yourself, and not others.  Although you may assist others in creating their own accounts, you may not impersonate others on the Digital Platforms.**

You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by Company in writing, you may only possess one Account.  You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity.

**3.              Mobile Network**

When you access the Digital Platforms through a mobile network, your network or roaming provider’s messaging, data and other rates and fees will apply.  Downloading, installing or using certain Digital Platforms may be prohibited or restricted by your network provider and not all Digital Platforms may work with your network provider or device.

**4.              Changes to the Digital Platforms**

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Digital Platforms and any material we provide on the Digital Platforms, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if, for any reason, all or any part of Digital Platforms is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Digital Platforms, or all Digital Platforms, to users, including registered users.

You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Digital Platforms (including but not limited to obtaining any necessary hardware and operating system software, or any internet connectivity that may be required to access the Digital Platforms).

**5.              Location Based Services**

Some of the features of the Digital Platforms may enable the Company to access your location in order to tailor your experience with the Digital Platform(s) based on your location ("Location-based Services"). In order to use certain Location-based Services, you must enable certain features of your hardware (e.g., your mobile phone), which enable the Company to identify your location through a variety of means, which may include IP address, cell tower location, geo-fencing technology, or detection by physical on-location Wi-Fi or Bluetooth sensors, as available. If you choose to disable any Location-based Services on your device, you may not be able to utilize certain features of the Digital Platforms. By enabling Location-based Services, you agree and acknowledge that: (i) device data we collect from you is directly relevant to your use of the Digital Platforms; (ii) we may provide Location-based Services related to and based on your then-current location; and (iii) we may use any such information collected in connection with provision of the Digital Platforms.

**6.             Guest to Guest Chat**

Our Digital Platforms may make available to you, at no charge, a guest-to-guest chat functionality that will enable you to stay connected with friends and family while sailing (the “Chat”). Please note G2G Chat functionality is available only while you are onboard one of our vessels, and only when you are connected to our Royal WiFi.

Importantly, you will only be able to use G2G Chat to stay connected with others in your reservation and/or stateroom. We may, in later releases, provide you the ability to stay connected with other guests onboard that are not in your traveling party.

We will retain G2G Chat history only for the duration of your voyage and we will purge all chat history once your voyage ends. Our Privacy Policy, and other applicable laws (including but not limited to the United States’ Stored Communications Act and the CLOUD Act) may apply with regard to the privacy of the content included in your G2G Chat communications.

You agree that you will not use G2G Chat to submit any material that you know to be false, defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane, threatening, or invasive of another guest’s privacy. You agree not to use G2G Chat to transmit any content intended to incite or provoke violence.

To the extent you use G2G Chat to upload, submit, store, send or receive content, you retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content.

When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our G2G Chat, you give us a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (i.e., adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works within our service), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. You represent and warrant that you have the necessary rights to grant us a license for any content that you submit to G2G Chat.

The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Digital Platforms.

For example, you may be able to use a Digital Key to open the door to your stateroom, a lounge, the gym, or certain other parts of the vessels.

None of the materials may be copied, reproduced, displayed, modified, published, uploaded, posted, transmitted or distributed in any form or by any means other than as described in the Linking Policy section or with the Company’s prior written permission.

We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of this information. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk. We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other visitor to the Digital Platforms, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents.

We may update the content on this Digital Platforms from time to time, but its content is not necessarily complete or up-to-date. Any of the material on the Digital Platforms may be out of date at any given time, and we are under no obligation to update such material.

**18.           Purchases**

All purchases through the Digital Platforms or other transactions for the sale of goods, or services or information formed through the Digital Platforms or as a result of visits made by you may be governed by separate terms of sale and terms of use.  Separate terms may be provided through the Digital Platforms, onboard our vessels, or via a separate channel (i.e., a port agent, prior to boarding).

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order prior to delivery.  Some situations that may result in your order being cancelled include system or typographical errors, inaccuracies in product or pricing information or product availability, fairness among customers where supplies are limited, or problems identified by our credit or fraud departments.  We also may require additional verification or information before accepting an order.  We will contact you if any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your order. 

When you provide payment information in connection with a purchase on the Digital Platforms, you represent and warrant that the information is accurate, that you are authorized to use the payment method provided, and that you will notify us of changes to the payment information. 

We may revise the pricing for products and services we offer.  When you place your order, we may estimate the tax and include that estimate in the total for your convenience.  The actual tax amount that will be applied to your order and charged to your payment method may differ from the estimate provided.

  **19.           Onboard Expense Account and Credit Card Charges**

We require credit card information in order to set up an expense account for sailing guests (the “Onboard Expense Account”). You may set up an Onboard Expense Account for you, your traveling party; or you may set up an Onboard Expense Account for sailing guest(s) even though you may not be part of a voyage.

More than one guest may use the same Onboard Expense Account. For example, you and all others in your stateroom may charge onboard purchases to the same Onboard Expense Account.  By including other guests in your Onboard Expense Account, you (a) authorize them to sign on behalf of the Onboard Expense Account and (b) authorize their purchases to be charged to your Onboard Expense Account and the credit card associated with it.

Prior to sailing, your Onboard Expense Account and the credit card associated with your Onboard Expense Account will not reflect any charges or authorizations.

By providing us credit card account information you certify you are the named cardholder and you authorize us to charge the credit card account you provide for any outstanding balance on the Onboard Expense Account prior to the end of your voyage.  You further agree to be personally liable for any outstanding balance disputed by the credit card issuer.

 Alternatively, in the event you are not the named cardholder, you certify you (a) are an adult with full legal authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the named cardholder, and (b) have received authorization from the named cardholder for us to charge the credit card account you provide for any outstanding balance on the Onboard Expense Account prior to the end of your voyage.  You further affirm that the named cardholder has had an opportunity to read these Terms, and that they understand and accept all these Terms. You further agree to be personally liable for any outstanding balance disputed by the named cardholder.

**20.           Vessel Operator**

  
Sailings may be operated by the Company, or its affiliates. **See your passenger ticket contract for the identity of the specific operator/carrier for your sailing.**

**21.           Nonrefundable Deposit Program**  

A booking made under the non-refundable deposit cruise fare rate (an "NRD Booking") requires the payment of a non-refundable deposit at the time of booking. The deposit is not refundable at any time after it has been paid. Payment of the full non-refundable deposit and the full name for each guest is required at the time of booking. Deposits made toward Guarantees and Grand Suites and higher categories are non-refundable and subject to NRD Booking terms. 

Each time the guest changes the ship or sail date of an NRD Booking prior to the final payment due date, payments made towards the NRD Booking will be applied to the balance of the modified booking and a $100 USD per person service fee will be charged to the modified booking.   
  
This offer is available exclusively to residents of United States and Canada. Prices are subject to availability, subject to change without notice; capacity controlled, and may be withdrawn at any time. The Company reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update fares, fees and surcharges at any time without prior notice.

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those Claims.   

**25.           Governing Law  
  
**

All matters relating to the Digital Platforms and these Terms of Use and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Florida or any other jurisdiction).

**26.           Forum Selection**

Unless you and the Company agree otherwise, to the greatest extent permitted by law, the state and federal courts in Florida will have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes (except for disputes brought in small claims court) that are not subject to arbitration or over any action involving the applicability or enforceability of the arbitration provision or any of its parts. You and the Company consent to the jurisdiction of those courts and waive any objections as to personal jurisdiction or venue in those courts, as well as any right to seek to transfer or change venue to another court.

**27.           Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

**Please read this arbitration provision carefully.** It affects your and our rights if there is a dispute. It requires you and us to resolve most disputes in arbitration after first trying to work it out between you and us. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court and uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Discovery is more limited in arbitration than in court. Arbitrators can award the same individualized remedies that a court can award. And their rulings are legally binding, subject to very limited review by courts. **Arbitration will take place on an individual basis.** Class and representative proceedings are not allowed, and you and we cannot seek, and arbitrators cannot award, relief on behalf of others.

_(a)    Claims Subject to Arbitration:_ Except as specified in paragraph (b) below, **any dispute or claim between you and us** must be arbitrated. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

·      claims arising out of or relating to the Terms, the Digital Platform, purchases of goods or services, or any other aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;

·      claims that arose before this or any prior agreement between you and us (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising or disclosures for any of our products or services);

·      claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of bodily injury;

·      claims relating to the retention, protection, use, or transfer of information about you or any of your accounts for any of our products or services;

·      claims relating to communications with you, regardless of sender, concerning any of our products or services, including emails and automatically dialed calls and text messages; and

In this arbitration provision only, references to "we" "us", and "our" include our past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venturers, as well as our and each of those entities' agents, employees, predecessors, successors, and assigns. In this arbitration provision only, references to "you" and "your" include all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of your account or use of the Digital Platforms, as well as your and each of those person's assignees, heirs, trustees, agents, or other representatives. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against you or us on the other's behalf. **By agreeing to arbitrate, you and we each waive the right to sue in court, to trial by jury, or to participate in a class or representative action.** This agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of the Terms or any other contract between you and us.

_(b)    Claims Not Subject to Arbitration:_ You and we agree that the following disputes or claims cannot be arbitrated:

·      claims arising from bodily injury or death;

·      claims arising from alleged infringement of intellectual property rights;

·      claims seeking only individualized relief asserted by you or us in small claims court, so long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction, in which case either party may elect arbitration;

·      disputes over the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision, whether a dispute or claim can or must be brought in arbitration, or whether paragraphs (d), (g), or (h) of this arbitration provision have been violated.

These exclusions from arbitration are intended to be interpreted narrowly.

_(c)     Pre-Arbitration Notice of Disputes and Informal Resolution:_ Before either you or we commence arbitration, the claimant must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to us should be sent by U.S. mail or professional courier service to: Legal Department, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., 1050 Caribbean Way, Miami, Florida 33132 ("Notice Address"). The Notice to you will be sent to your address on file with your account or, if we do not . The Notice must include: (a) the claimant’s name, mailing address, email address, and phone number; (b) the account user name; (c) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (d) the specific relief sought. The Notice must be personally signed by you (if you are the claimant) or by our business representative (if we are the claimant). To safeguard your account, please be advised that we cannot disclose information about your account to anyone but you, unless you have provided us with signed, written permission to do so. Accordingly, if you have retained an attorney to submit your Notice, please also provide signed written authorization for us to discuss your account and share your account records with your attorney.

After the Notice containing all of the information above is received, within 60 days, either party may request an individualized discussion (by telephone or videoconference) regarding settlement (“Informal Settlement Conference”). You and we must work together in good faith to select a mutually agreeable time during business hours for the Informal Settlement Conference (which can be after the 60-day period). You and our business representative must both personally participate in the Informal Settlement Conference, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Your and our lawyers (if any) also can participate.

Any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations periods will be tolled during the Informal Resolution Period, which is the period between the date that a fully complete Notice is received by the other party and the later of (i) 60 days later or (ii) the date an Informal Settlement Conference is completed, if timely requested.

_(d)    Commencing Arbitration:_ An arbitration proceeding cannot be commenced until after the Informal Resolution Period has ended. A court will have authority to enforce this paragraph (d), including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations without first providing a fully complete Notice and participating in a timely requested Informal Settlement Conference. The court also may enjoin the assessment or collection of arbitration fees incurred as a result of such arbitrations. Further, unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider shall not accept nor administer any arbitration unless the claimant has complied with the Notice and Informal Settlement Conference requirements of paragraph (c).

_(e)     Arbitration Procedure and Minimum Recovery:_ The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this arbitration provision, and will be administered by the AAA. (If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer arbitrations consistent with this arbitration provision, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties or by the court.) The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by writing to the Notice Address. As in court, you and we agree that any counsel representing someone in arbitration certifies that they will comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including a certification that the claim or the relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under that rule, the AAA Rules, or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate represented parties and counsel. The arbitrator may consider rulings in arbitrations involving different customers, but an arbitrator’s ruling is not binding in proceedings involving different customers. Except as provided in paragraph (g) below, the arbitrator shall apply the same substantive law that a court would apply and can award the same individualized remedies (including punitive and statutory damages and statutory attorney's fees and costs) that a court could award under applicable law. Unless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your residence. The arbitrator may also conduct hearings telephonically, by videoconference, or decide matters based on papers submitted by the parties. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you are entitled. If you have complied with the requirements of this paragraph and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that exceeds the value of our last written settlement to you before the appointment of the arbitrator, then we will pay you $5,000 in lieu of any smaller award (the “Minimum Recovery”). In determining whether you are entitled to the Minimum Recovery, the arbitrator shall not consider amounts offered or awarded for attorneys' fees or costs. Any disputes as to recovery of the Minimum Recovery shall be resolved by the arbitrator, and must be raised within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

_(f)     Arbitration Fees:_ We  will pay all AAA filing, administration, case-management, hearing, and arbitrator fees (“AAA Fees”) if we initiate an arbitration. If you initiate arbitration of claims valued at $10,000 or less, we will pay all AAA Fees, so long as you have fully complied with the Notice and Informal Settlement Conference requirements in paragraph (c). In such cases, we will pay the filing fee directly to the AAA upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration or, if the AAA makes you pay the filing fee, we will send that amount to the AAA and request that the AAA reimburse you. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief you seek is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.

_(g)    Requirement of Individual Arbitration:_ The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general proceedings; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or request for relief shall be severed and decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.

_(h)     Coordinated Arbitrations:_ If 25 or more claimants submit Notices or seek to file arbitrations raising similar claims and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (whether such cases are pursued simultaneously or not), all the cases must be resolved in staged proceedings. You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your claim. In the first stage, we and claimants’ counsel will each select up to 25 cases (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by different arbitrators. If feasible, the arbitrators will be from the respective claimants’ home states. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed or proceed in arbitration, and the AAA must not assess or demand payment of fees for the remaining cases or administer or accept them.

The arbitrators are encouraged to resolve the cases within 120 days of appointment or as swiftly as possible thereafter, consistent with fairness to the parties. After the first stage is completed, the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining cases, and we will pay the mediation fee. If the parties cannot agree how to resolve the remaining cases after mediation, they will repeat the process of selecting and filing up to 50 cases to be resolved individually by different arbitrators, followed by mediation.

If any claims remain after the second stage, the process will be repeated until all claims are resolved, with four differences. First, a total of 100 cases may be filed in the third and later stages. Second, the cases will be randomly selected. Third, arbitrators who decided cases in the first two stages may be appointed in later stages if different arbitrators are not available. Fourth, mediation is optional at the election of counsel for the claimants.

Between stages, counsel will meet and confer regarding ways to improve the efficiency of the staged proceedings, including whether to increase the number of cases filed in each stage. Either party may also negotiate with AAA regarding the amount or timing of AAA fees.

If this paragraph applies to a Notice, the Informal Resolution Period for the claims and relief set forth in that Notice will be extended (including the tolling of any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period for the claims and requested relief) until that Notice is selected for a staged proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court will have the authority to enforce this paragraph, including by enjoining the mass filing, the prosecution or administration of arbitrations, or the assessment or collection of AAA fees.

This paragraph and each of its requirements are intended to be severable from the rest of this arbitration provision. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court decides that the staging process in this paragraph is not enforceable, then the cases may be filed in arbitration and the payment of AAA filing, administration, case-management, hearing, and arbitrator fees will be assessed as the arbitrations advance and arbitrators are appointed rather than when the arbitrations are initiated.

_(i)      Future Changes to Arbitration Provision:_ Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject that change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the first notice of the change to the Notice Address provided above. To be effective, your rejection must include your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, account user name (if any), and a statement personally signed by you that you wish to reject the change to the arbitration provision. By rejecting that future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute or claim between you and us in accordance with the language of this provision, as amended by any changes that you did not timely reject.
