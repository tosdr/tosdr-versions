Any and all Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.  
  
13.2 Arbitration Rules  
  
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800- 778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any Disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance- based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For Disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrate or may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  
  
13.3 Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration  
  
If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.  
  
13.4 Authority of the Arbitrator  
  
The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Capitalise.ai. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Capitalise.ai.  
  
13.5 Waiver of Jury Trial  
  
YOU AND CAPITALISE WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, OTHER THAN IN RESPECT OF EXCLUDED DISPUTES.

13.7 Confidentiality  
  
No part of the procedures will be open to the public or the media. All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order, or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party will be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information needed to enforce this arbitration agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.  
  
13.8 Right to Waive  
  
Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.  
  
13.9 Opt-out  
  
You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Capitalise.ai can force the other to arbitrate.

The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Tel Aviv-Jaffa in respect of Excluded Disputes and hereby submit themselves to the jurisdiction of these courts.13.13 U.N. Convention. The application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or other international laws is expressly excluded, whether the claim is in arbitration or at court.  
  
14\. General  
  
(i) if any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and if such provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable nonetheless, the provision shall be deemed to be sever able from the remainder of these Terms and shall not cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of these Terms; (ii) You acknowledge and agree that Capitalise.ai has the right, at any time and for any reason, to redesign or modify the Capitalise.ai IPR and other elements of the Services or any part thereof; (iii) these Terms are the entire agreement between you and Capitalise.ai regarding the subject matter herein and these Terms shall not be modified except by a written instrument executed by both parties; (iv) Capitalise.ai may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion.

Any unauthorized assignment will be void and of no force or effect; (v) no provisions of these Terms are intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person or entity other than you and Capitalise.ai any rights, remedies or other benefits under or by reason of these Terms; (vi) Capitalise.ai’s failure to enforce any rights granted here under or to take action against you in the event of any breach here under shall not be deemed a waiver by Capitalise.ai as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breaches; (vii) all waivers must be in writing. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion; (viii) ANY CAUSE OF ACTION INITIATED BY YOU AND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.
