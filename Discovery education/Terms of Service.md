These Terms of Service and Licence (these “**Standard Terms**”) are applicable to any Order Form (each, an “**Order Form**”) issued by Discovery Education Europe Limited ( “**Discovery Education**”) to the individual or entity listed in the Order Form (“**Subscriber**”) to provide access to the Discovery Education: Pathway CPD products and services identified therein (the “**Services**”) and to Subscriber’s use of the Services. Each Order Form shall be deemed to be part of these Standard Terms and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. These Standard Terms supersede all other prior and contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, communications or understandings, oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof. In no event shall the terms and conditions of any other purchase agreement amend or modify the terms and conditions of these Standard Terms.

### 1\. RIGHTS OF ACCESS AND USE

1.1. **Grant of Licence**. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Discovery Education grants to Subscriber, and, if Subscriber is a school rather than an individual, to those of its authorized educators employed by Subscriber whose names and email addresses are listed in the Order Form (the “**Users**”), for the Term, a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable and revocable licence to access the Service(s) and any and all content included therein (the “**Content**”), and to download, stream, and edit the Content pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in these Standard Terms. Discovery Education may, in its sole discretion, make changes to the Services and/or the Content. All rights not expressly granted to Subscriber and its Users pursuant to these Standard Terms are reserved to Discovery Education, and all uses of the Content by Subscriber and its Users not expressly permitted herein are prohibited.

1.2. **Access**. Discovery Education shall provide Subscriber access to the Service(s) by the date identified in the Order Form. Access rights granted to Subscriber shall be limited to those access rights necessary to use of the intended functionality of the Service(s). Discovery Education reserves the right to restrict or prevent access to activities or suspected activities that involve security breaches, hacking, distributed denial of service attacks, or uploading a virus, Trojan horse, time bomb, unauthorized application, or any other harmful form of programming or vandalism.

1.3. **Permitted and Prohibited Uses.**

a. **Use for Educational, Non-Commercial Purposes Only**. Subscriber and its Users may use the Service(s) and the Content for bona fide educational and research purposes only and may not use them in any commercial or for-profit manner. Discovery Education reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to limit Subscriber’s and/or any Users’ use of the Service(s) in the event that Discovery Education, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems Subscriber’s and/or such Users’ use thereof to be inconsistent with educational and research purposes, and/or inconsistent with these Standard Terms.

b. **Downloading of Content**. Users may download, for non-commercial instructional use, including for lesson plans, copies of (i) images; (ii) videos and video clips; and (iii) worksheets or other documents; in each case if designated on the Service(s) as downloadable. Copies must be deleted or erased after use or expiration of the Term, whichever occurs first. Such downloading shall be for individual User convenience only, and Users may not (1) systematically download any of the Content, (2) create distribution “libraries”, or (3) transfer, sell, rent, display, or exhibit any of the Content to any third party other than Users.

c. **Editing Content**. Users may edit reading materials and such other content as is designated on the Service(s) as editable (together the “**Editable Content**”). The Editable Content, as edited by User, as well as any work containing User-edited content, may not contain any libelous or unlawful materials or content or any commercial advertising materials, will not infringe upon any party’s proprietary rights, including but not limited to statutory or common-law copyright, trademark and right of privacy, and may not violate any law, regulation or right of any kind whatsoever or give rise to any actionable claim or liability. Under no circumstances may a User convert the Content from digital to analogue format, such as by recording a video clip onto a DVD. Violation of this Section 1.3(c) may constitute copyright infringement. User must maintain all copyright, trademark and proprietary notices included with, attached to or embedded all editable videos and video clips without modification, obstruction or deletion. The Content may include certain ancillary educational materials, such as teacher reading materials, diagrams, exercises and other graphic devices that support the Services (“**Ancillary Materials**”). User may modify, alter and revise the Ancillary Materials to meet specific instructional needs, provided that the following statement is prominently displayed on all such revised Ancillary Materials, in addition to any other proprietary notices, and with the understanding that Discovery Education or its content provider shall continue to own the Ancillary Materials: “_Revised with the permission of Discovery Education. Discovery Education and its content providers are not responsible for the content or accuracy of the revision_”.

d. **Dissemination of Content**. In the course of using any Content as permitted hereunder, Subscriber and its Users may not make the Content, or any part thereof, available to any party who is not a Subscriber or a User, except as permitted herein. Subscriber and its Users must ensure that the Content is at all times kept on a secure server, viewable only by Subscriber and/or its Users.

e. **Prohibited Uses**. Except as expressly set forth herein, neither Subscriber nor the Users may (i) copy, reproduce, alter, modify, transmit, perform, create derivative works of, publish, sub-license, distribute, or circulate the Service(s), the Content, or any portion thereof; (ii) disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer the Service(s) or any portion thereof, or use a robot, spider, or any similar device to copy or catalog the Content or any portion thereof; (iii) take any actions, whether intentional or unintentional, that may circumvent, disable, damage or impair the Service(s)’s or the Content’s control or security systems, nor allow or assist a third party to do so; or (iv) use the Content in a manner that disparages the Service(s), the Content or Discovery Education or its content providers, or in any manner that Discovery Education may, in its sole discretion, deem inappropriate. Subscriber and the Users acknowledge and agree that the Service(s) and the Content possess a special, unique and extraordinary character that makes difficult the assessment of the monetary damages that would be sustained as a result of unauthorized use, and that unauthorized use may cause immediate and irreparable damage to Discovery Education for which Discovery Education would not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, Subscriber agrees that, in the event of such unauthorized use, in addition to such other legal and equitable rights and remedies as may be available to Discovery Education, Discovery Education shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity of proving damages or furnishing a bond or other security.

f. **Credentials**. Each User shall have a valid generic or individual username, password, passcode, and in certain circumstances, IP authentication, for the purpose of accessing the Service(s) and the Content (the “**Log-In Information**”). Subscriber and its Users must keep all Log-In Information strictly confidential, and all Log-In Information may be used only by the assigned User. Subscriber and its Users are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of all Log-In Information, and for preventing access to the Service(s) and/or the Content by unauthorized persons using a User’s Log-In Information. Unauthorized access to or use of the Service(s) and/or the Content by someone using a User’s Log-In information may be attributed to such User. Subscriber acknowledges that Discovery Education may require access to Subscriber’s systems in order to perform single sign-on integration services to facilitate User access to the Service(s) and Content. Subscriber hereby grants to Discovery Education a limited licence to access such systems.

1.4 **Subscriber Changes to Users**. If Subscriber is:

* an individual educator licensing the Service(s) for him or herself, the Service(s) is personal to Subscriber and Subscriber shall be entitled to use the Service(s) at any school or educational establishment where Subscriber works during the Term, subject to notifying Discovery Education of any change in Log-In Information necessitated by any such move; or
* a school or educational establishment licensing the Service(s) for individual named educators in its employ, it acknowledges that the Service(s) is personal to the school or educational establishment and may not be reassigned to different educators should any of the original named educators leave its employ during the Term. If an educator leaves the relevant school or educational establishment, Subscriber shall notify Discovery Education in writing that such educator has moved if they no longer wish such educator to have continued access to the Service(s) and may request that Discovery Education change its authorized educators by emailing such changes to Discovery Education at schoolsupport@discoveryed.com and such changes shall take effect on the anniversary of the Effective Date. In the event such requested changes result in changes to the delivery of Services or Fees, Discovery Education shall notify Subscriber in writing.
