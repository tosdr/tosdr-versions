_This page describes our Cookie policy for www.discoveryeducation.co.uk and_ www.espresso.co.uk _(the website)._

_If you do not accept this Cookie policy, please do not use this site._ 

**Last updated:** 30 August 2023

Introduction
------------

Discovery Education’s websites, [www.discoveryeducation.co.uk](http://www.discoveryeducation.co.uk/) and [www.espresso.co.uk](http://www.espresso.co.uk/), and other websites that link to this Cookie Policy (collectively our “Websites”), online services, interactive applications, and marketing campaigns use cookies and other related technologies (for convenience all technologies are referred to in this Cookie Policy as “cookies”). This Cookie Policy explains our use of cookies on our Websites, online services, interactive applications, and marketing campaigns. For more information about how we process your personal information, please read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.discoveryeducation.co.uk/privacy-policy/).

What is a cookie?
-----------------

A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your device when you visit a website or online service. Cookies allow a website to recognise users when they return to a website. Cookies may contain data, and that typically includes a unique identifier and a site name. A cookie could also include personal data if you have provided that information to a website. The next time you visit the same website, the browser will give back the cookie to identify you or your device to personalize your experience.

The cookies we set are called “first-party cookies.” The cookies set by other parties are called “third-party cookies.” Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service that you are using (such as interactive content and analytics).

Cookies that are created temporarily while you are visiting a website and are automatically deleted when you leave the website are called “session cookies.” Session cookies can be used to recognize and link your actions during a single browsing session. Cookies that can be stored for longer are called “persistent cookies,” and can be used to remember your preferences or actions on the website or service that you are using.

Cookie Inventory
----------------

The names and description of the cookies on our Websites are available in our cookie inventory.

Social Media Buttons
--------------------

We include buttons for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn to promote webpages or share on these social network sites. These buttons work using pieces of code coming from the social networks themselves. This code places cookies. These social media buttons also can store and process certain information. Please read the privacy policies of these social networks (which can change regularly) to read what they do with your personal data which they process using these cookies.

How we use Cookies
------------------

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons including:

* for security and fraud prevention purposes,
* to tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,
* to remember your preferences and settings,
* to help you sign into our online services,
* to adapt the display format of our content to your device and preferences,
* to facilitate and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, advertisements, and web searches, and
* to analyze how well our websites are working.

Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and online services to work, and we refer to these as “essential” cookies. Some cookies measure traffic and statistical data about usage of our Websites and online services, which we use to understand how our Websites and online services are being used, and we refer to these as “performance” cookies. Other cookies enable us to personalize your experience or otherwise improve the functionality of our Websites and online services, and we refer to these as “functional” cookies. Lastly, we also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, advertisements, and web searches, and we refer to these as “targeting” cookies.

We never use targeting cookies on our online services aimed at students. For students using our online services, we only use strictly necessary cookies and limited performance and functionality cookies in order to provide our services to our users.

Third Parties
-------------

Cookies are also placed by third parties we have engaged. These companies have their own privacy policies and data collection practices. Please refer to each company’s privacy policy to better understand their privacy practices and the controls available to you.
