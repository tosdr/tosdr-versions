If you are a contracted tutor, instructor, expert, or educator (collectively, “Professionals”) through the Site, then we (or our business partner(s) who process payment transactions for us) will collect bank account or other financial information in order to facilitate payments to you based upon invoices you submit through the Site and in conjunction with your signed independent contractor agreement(s). Please note that for security we do not store sensitive cardholder data, such as full credit or debit card numbers, card authentication data, or sensitive bank account information.

**Personal, professional, and education-related information.** Professionals who seek to enter into independent contractor agreements with Varsity Tutors or its related and/or affiliated entities are asked to provide additional personal information in support of the Professional’s respective skills and experience, as well as a social security number or taxpayer identification number for tax purposes and government-issued identification, as necessary to facilitate payment and to comply with legal obligations.

**Student data.** Varsity Tutors for Schools LLC (“VTS”) is an affiliate of Varsity Tutors that contracts with Schools, School Districts, and other local or state education agencies across the US (“Schools”). In conjunction with those agreements between VTS and Schools (“School Agreement(s)”), we may collect and have access to certain personal data of School students that, alone or in combination, is linked or is linkable to a specific student (“School Data”) who has access to the Site through the agreements with Schools. Varsity Tutors or VTS shall only collect and use School Data for the purposes of providing the services set forth in the respective School Agreement(s). General terms between VTS and Schools are set forth [here](https://www.varsitytutors.com/school-solutions/terms).

This includes comments, reviews, documents, questions, chats, messages, assessments, videos, or photos. Such shared content may be publicly viewable by others depending on where it is posted, shared, or viewed. We also collect any other information you may provide to us or authorize us to collect, including any other identifier that permits the ability to contact you. If you communicate with Varsity Tutors or its affiliates by e-mail; post messages to forums; make telephone or cell phone calls or texts; communicate through electronic devices or other interactive devices; complete online forms, surveys, sweepstakes, or contest entries; or communicate with Varsity Tutors or its affiliates by any means, any information provided in such communication may be collected by Varsity Tutors.

In addition, we may post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our Site that may contain personally identifiable information; however, if/when that happens, we obtain the person's consent via email or other means prior to posting the testimonial, which authorizes us to post certain information along with their testimonial. We may invite you to complete a survey or participate in a promotion, either through the Site or through a third-party platform.

### LSOs

### Behavioral Targeting

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites.
