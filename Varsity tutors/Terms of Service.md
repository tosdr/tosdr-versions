You acknowledge that the Consent to Communications provision of this Agreement is not binding on you unless you have provided your Express Written Consent (as defined above) to this Agreement.

a) **Agreement to Receive Communications from Company.**

By using the Platform and providing your phone number and/or email on the Platform, you agree and acknowledge that Company may communicate with you via email, text messaging, text receipts, Short Messaging Service (“SMS”), facsimile, and all phone calls at the number you provide. Such communications may be for any purpose, including marketing purposes, purposes related to Tutors and the Service provided to Tutors, and purposes related to Students and the Service provided to Students, using all methods now known and discovered in the future, including, but not limited to, auto-dialers, artificial messages, pre-recorded messages, general telemarketing practices, and all other electronic communication. You agree that these calls may be regarding products and/or Service that Company may market to you and that you are not obligated to receive such calls in order to purchase said products and/or Service. **Company will not charge you a fee for sending SMS text messages, but your communication Service provider may. You agree to pay any fee(s) or charges(s) that you may incur for incoming and outgoing text messages from or to Company or Company's assigns, successors, Servicers or agents, without reimbursement from Company or them.**

You understand that, should the phone number provided above cease to be a valid means to contact you or if you cease to retain ownership of the phone number, you have an obligation to provide Company notification of same through email at [dnc@varsitytutors.com](mailto:dnc@varsitytutors.com). You understand and agree that, if Company sends you a communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address or phone number on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive communications, Company will be deemed to have provided the communication to you. Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add Company to your email address book so that you will be able to receive the communications Company sends to you.

By electronically providing your Express Written Consent to this consent to communications, you are confirming that you have agreed to the terms and conditions herein and you have had an opportunity to download or print a copy of the Agreement for your file.

Company may modify or terminate its text messaging service from time to time, for any reason, and without notice, including the right to terminate text messaging with or without notice, without liability to you, any other User or a third party.

**4\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**
------------------------------------------

You expressly acknowledge that the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision of this Agreement is not binding on you unless you have provided your Express Written Consent (as defined above) to this Agreement. If you have provided your Express Written Consent (as defined above), the following provisions of this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision are binding on you.

a) **Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Company.**

YOU AND COMPANY MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY ARBITRATION, as set forth below. This arbitration provision (“**Arbitration Provision**”) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after the Agreement terminates or your relationship with Company ends. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. Except as expressly provided below, this Arbitration Provision applies to all claims between you and Company, including Company’s affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and assigns, and each of Company’s respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or shareholders.

Except as expressly provided below, ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US (EACH A “**CLAIM**” AND COLLECTIVELY, “**CLAIMS**”) SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY. These claims include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: this Agreement and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof); the Platform; the Service; any other goods or service made available through the Platform; your relationship with Company; the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of this Agreement; payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you; any promotions or offers made by Company; any city, county, state or federal wage-hour law; trade secrets; unfair competition; breaks and rest periods; expense reimbursement; wrongful termination; discrimination; harassment; retaliation; fraud; defamation; emotional distress; breach of any express or implied contract or covenant; claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws; claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Company and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance for employees eligible under the specific benefit plan), and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common law claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Provision) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.

BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. This Arbitration Provision is intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of this Arbitration Provision are expressly excluded from the requirement to arbitrate.

b) **Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.**

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS (“**CLASS ACTION WAIVER**”). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS SECTION (b) SHALL NOT APPLY TO REPRESENTATIVE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST COMPANY, WHICH ARE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY IN SECTION (c).

The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Provision, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Consumer Arbitration Rules (“**AAA Rules**”), disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any claims, the class, collective, and/or representative action on such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other claims to the fullest extent possible.

c) **Representative PAGA Waiver.**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration Provision, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Company agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“**PAGA**”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and Company agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “**representative PAGA Waiver**”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Provision or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Provision or the requirement that any remaining claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Provision; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those claims, the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

d) **Rules Governing the Arbitration.**

Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Provision shall be administered by the AAA pursuant to its  [Consumer Arbitration Rules](https://www.adr.org/node/158#%2540%253F_afrWindowId%253D57rsw71ei_1%2526_afrLoop%253D1335893675945842%2526doc%253DADRSTAGE2021424%2526_afrWindowMode%253D0%2526_adf.ctrl-state%253D57rsw71ei_79) that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Arbitration Provision. Copies of the Consumer Arbitration Rules can be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class proceeding.

As part of the arbitration, both you and Company will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.

e) **Arbitration Fees and Awards.**

The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA Rules subject to the following modifications:

* If you initiate arbitration under this Arbitration Provision after participating in the optional Negotiation process described in section (j) below and are otherwise required to pay a filing fee under the relevant AAA Rules, Company agrees that, unless your claim is for $5,000 or more, your share of the filing and arbitration fees is limited to $50, and that, after you submit proof of payment of the filing fee to Company, Company will promptly reimburse you for all but $50 of the filing fee. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
* If Company initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Provision, Company will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
* Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
* At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable arbitration fees and costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.
* Although under some laws Company may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Company agrees that it will not seek such an award.
* If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Company’s last written settlement offer made after you participated in good faith in the optional Negotiation process described in section (i) below, then Company will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000, whichever is greater.

f) **Location and Manner of Arbitration.**

Unless you and Company agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between you and Company will take place in the county of your billing address. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Company agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as determined by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.

g) **Exceptions to Arbitration.**

This Arbitration Provision shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in section (c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; and (4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of law.

Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with any local, state, or federal agency and nothing in this Arbitration Provision shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any local, state, or federal agency, to the extent you are entitled to pursue such a claim, in order to fulfill the party’s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration, however you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative complaint and instead may seek such relief only through arbitration under this Arbitration Provision. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Provision prevents your participation in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision.

h) **Severability.**

In addition to the severability provisions in section (c) above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Provision shall be given full force and effect.

i) **Opting Out of Arbitration.**

You may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate claims defined in section (e)(3) pursuant to the terms of this section. If you do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Provision with respect to claims, you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such claims by notifying Company in writing of your desire to opt out of arbitration for such claims, which writing must be dated, signed and delivered by: (1) electronic mail to [corporate@varsitytutors.com](mailto:corporate@varsitytutors.com) or (2) by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or by any nationally recognized delivery Service (e.g, UPS, Federal Express, etc.) that is addressed to:

Varsity Tutors LLC.  
Attn: Legal Department  
101 S. Hanley Rd., Suite 300  
St. Louis, MO 63105

In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Provision with respect to claims, (B) the writing must include the name, phone number, and email address associated with you, and (C) the email or envelope containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days of the date this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the 30-day period, you and Company shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Provision in full.

You should assume that there may be now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against Company alleging class, collective, and/or representative claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf, and which, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree to arbitration of claims with Company under this Arbitration Provision, you are agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all monetary and other relief, against Company in an individual arbitration provision. You are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to recover monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class, collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Provision and you will not be subject to retaliation, if you exercise your right to assert claims or timely opt-out of arbitration, for any claims under this Arbitration Provision.

j) **Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.**

Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and Company may agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by you and Company. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this section must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“**Notice**”). The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.
