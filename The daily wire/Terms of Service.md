As part of registering or submitting information to purchase a Subscription Paid Services, you authorize DW (either directly or through its affiliates, subsidiaries or other third parties) to request and collect payment (or otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing actions) from our payment provider or your designated banking account, and to make any inquiries DW or its affiliates may consider necessary to validate your designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from your payment, credit card or banking account provider (e.g., updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to us by your credit card company). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE MAY SUBMIT CHARGES WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. YOU ALSO REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD THAT YOU SUBMIT IN CONNECTION WITH A TRANSACTION.

**c. Price Increases.** Daily Wire may increase the price of Subscriptions at any time; however, we will give you at least thirty (30) days advance notice of any price increase. This advance notice will give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the price increase goes into effect in the following billing cycle. If you do not cancel your Subscription before the price increase goes into effect, you will be deemed to have agreed to the price increase.

**d. Free Trial Period.** Your Subscription may begin with a free trial. If this is the case, we will begin charging you for your Subscription at the end of the free trial period and the date of such charge will be considered your purchase date for purposes of calculating any renewals of your Subscription. To avoid being charged, you must cancel your Subscription before the end of the free trial period.

**e. Promotional Codes.** If you use a promotional code to obtain a Subscription, such code only applies to the period identified in the Additional Terms provided with the promotional code. Promotional codes may not be applied to renewal periods of existing Subscriptions. Please carefully review the Additional Terms provided with the promotional code before use. Promotional codes do not apply to gift membership purchases or membership upgrades, unless otherwise provided.

**f. Renewal Terms. YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE RENEWED AUTOMATICALLY, AND YOU WILL BE CHARGED IN ADVANCE OF EACH BILLING CYCLE UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR RENEWAL. DW RESERVES THE RIGHT, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, NOT TO RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.** For all subscriptions, you must cancel your automatic subscription renewal before it renews in order to avoid the billing of subscription fees for the renewal term to your credit card.

**g. Cancellation Process.** If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of your current subscription period. You must cancel your subscription prior to 11:59 p.m. Central time on the day before your next automatic renewal date in order to avoid being charged for the next renewal period. You may cancel your Subscription renewal by either: (i) going to [https://www.dailywire.com/account/subscription](https://www.dailywire.com/account/subscription%20%20) and selecting “cancel” at the bottom of the subscription level section of your settings page, or (ii) by contacting us using the request form at [https://support.dailywire.com/hc/requests/new](https://support.dailywire.com/hc/requests/new%20) specifying the email address used for the account and clearly indicating that you want to cancel your Subscription renewal.

**h. Refund Policy.** Unless required by law, all purchases of subscriptions, whether for yourself or as a gift are final and are nonrefundable/nonreturnable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used subscription periods or terms. We reserve the right to issue or not issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we do issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.

**i. Text Promotions and Discounts.** Send JOIN to 83400 to receive promotional and discount text messages from Daily Wire. Please see the “Text Messaging” section above for additional information.

In the event such a chargeback is issued by you, DW reserves its right to terminate any existing subscription and prevent you from using the service at its discretion.

**12\. Dispute Resolution**

Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Service, the Content, your UGC, any applicable Additional Terms, or the relationship of the parties, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a **“Dispute”**) shall be solely and exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If we are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute.

No Dispute may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator, if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof. **BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO PRESENT A DISPUTE IN COURT, RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE.**This Section 12 shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq., and not by the law of any state, and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis.

Either party may seek enforcement of this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.
