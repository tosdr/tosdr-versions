**7\. Cookies and Online Tracking Technologies** 

DW may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) and other third-party tracking technologies such as web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage) to collect general and personally identifiable information, including Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information about visitors to the Websites. The information collected is used to improve the experience of the Websites and Services, such as allowing us to recognize you when you revisit the Websites to provide you with customized information and/or to remember your preferences. We use cookies and other third-party tracking technologies such as web beacons to collect Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.

If you use our mobile application on a desktop, a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a Resettable Device Identifier from your device. Resettable Device Identifiers (also known as mobile advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the “Identifier for Advertisers” (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.

We and our service providers may use session-replay tools, which record your interactions with our Services, such as how you move throughout our Services and engage with our webforms. In addition to the uses described in the “How we use the Information we Collect” section above, this information helps us improve our Services and identify and fix technical issues visitors may be having with our Services.

For more information on how to manage cookies and the categories of cookies used on the Websites, please see below (“Preference Management”).

**8\. Online Advertising**

We may partner with third parties (Third Party Providers and Advertisers, collectively known as “Advertisers”) that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant online advertising to you. Our partners may place or recognize a cookie on your computer, device or directly in our emails/communications, and we may share Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information with them, as permitted by law and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Our partners may link the Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. For example, our partners may deliver an ad to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you based on the fact that you visited a particular website. We may use automated decision-making to customize your experience based on your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information.

Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an ad network may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown on the Websites, the Services or on third-party websites.

We offer you the ability to opt out of sales and sharing of your personal information as set forth in the “Right to Opt Out of Sales and Sharing of Personal Information” section below.

We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share the personal information of consumers under sixteen (16) years of age.

If you provide content to the Services, such as submitting comments or content as a part of a DW subscription, any information that you submit will become public. It may become accessible through search engines or, if you sign in using credentials from a third-party social networking service, to users on that service.

This Section 9 does not apply to information obtained by Daily Wire through the text messaging short code. Daily Wire does not sell, rent, loan, trade, lease or otherwise transfer for profit any phone numbers or personal information collected through the Daily Wire short code texting program to any third party. Nonetheless, Daily Wire reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, to avoid liability, or to protect Daily Wire’s rights or property.

**10\. Retention of Information**

We will store your Personal Information for no longer than is necessary for the performance of our obligations or to achieve the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected, or as may be required or permitted under applicable law. To determine the appropriate retention period, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the data; the purposes for which we process the data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means; and the applicable legal requirements. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, at the end of the retention period we will remove Personal Information from our systems and records or take appropriate steps to properly anonymize, deidentify, or aggregate it, where legally applicable.

The specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you:

Where required by law, we will provide this information in a portable and, if technically feasible, readily usable format.

Right to Delete Your Personal Information. You have the right to request that we delete Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Under the CCPA and CPRA, we may decline to delete your Personal Information under certain circumstances, for example, if we need the Personal Information to complete transactions or provide services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes (including maintaining business records), to comply with law, or to exercise or defend legal claims. Note also that we are not required to delete your Personal Information that we did not collect directly from you.

Right to Opt Out of Sales and Sharing of Personal Information. You have the right to opt out of the sale of your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information, and to request that we do not share your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising. To opt-out, please click here or use the “Do Not Sell or Share My Information” link contained in the footer of the DW website.  Please note that opting-out of the sale of your information for interest-based advertising purposes does not mean you will stop seeing ads, including interest-based ads, and your information that was collected and sold prior to 90 days before your opt-out request may be further used and sold for interest-based advertising purposes

Alternatively, to submit a request to exercise any of your California privacy rights, please contact us using one of the following methods:  
• Via our [Privacy Center](https://privacy.dailywire.com/)  
• Via email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.dailywire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  
• Call us at ​​1(866)TDW-CPRA (839-2772)

Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. We do not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes to which the right to limit use and disclosure applies under the CCPA and CPRA.

Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making. You have the right to opt out of automated decision-making, including profiling, that we use to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to your performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements.  

Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights. If you choose to exercise any of your privacy rights under the CCPA and CPRA, you also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us.

You may use an authorized agent to submit requests. We do not discriminate against a user if they exercise any of the rights available under the CCPA or CPRA. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data and permitted under the law. We will make a good faith estimate of the value of the consumer’s data based on relevant expenses related to the collection and retention of Personal Information as part of each such program.

In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information as permitted by applicable state laws that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described below or in its program terms. Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional. You will have to affirmatively opt-in to the program and you can opt-out of each program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable program description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program | Incentive Offered | Material Term | How to Opt In |
| Email Sign Up Discount | First-time email signup consumers earn 10% off their first purchase. | The Email and Text Message Sign Up Discount is available to consumers who are 18 years of age or older, and discounts are redeemable only at https://store.dailywire.com on full price styles, exclusions apply. We collect your email address to facilitate our operations, send you marketing messages, and to provide you with benefits. | Participating in the Email Sign Up Discount is entirely optional but is subject to additional terms and conditions and exclusions. You may opt in by providing your email address on our website at the link available from time to time at our store page, https://store.dailywire.com and opting in to receive messages from us. |

The financial incentive we offer to consumers through each program is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. We have made a good faith estimate of the value of the consumer’s data based on relevant expenses related to the collection and retention of personal information as part of each program.

Participants in a financial incentive program may make a personal information deletion request as set forth herein. Consumers that are part of a rewards program will then be sent an email requesting that they confirm that they want to delete their respective program data. You may also terminate program participation at any time, as explained in each program’s terms or by calling us at (818) 699-9948. Upon a termination request, some program data associated with the terminated account may be retained for recordkeeping, tax reporting, and other legally permissible purposes. You can opt out of non-program marketing emails or delete your personal information from our active marketing lists and retain your program account and benefits.

We will not fulfill a request pursuant to CCPA or CPRA unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the consumer about whom we collected Personal Information and/or Sensitive Personal Information. We will take appropriate steps to confirm the identity of a consumer making a request for purposes of verifying the authenticity of the request. You may be required to provide certain Personal Information to allow us to verify that you are the consumer about whom the request is being made. If you request that we provide you with specific pieces of Personal Information about you, we will apply heightened verification standards. An authorized agent may submit a request on behalf of a consumer if the consumer has provided the authorized agent with power of attorney in accordance with necessary state law; alternatively, the agent must (1) present verifiable written authorization from the consumer that the agent has the consumer’s permission to submit the request; and (2) independently verify the agent’s own identity with Daily Wire. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. Some Personal Information we maintain about consumers (e.g., clickstream data) is not sufficiently associated with enough Personal Information about the consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular consumer’s Personal Information. Accordingly, we will not include such information in response to consumer requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. We will use Personal Information provided in your request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses unless you also provided the Personal Information to us for another purpose.

We do not sell the Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.

Please note that while CCPA and CPRA rights do apply to Personal Information collected from job applicants and employees, this policy only covers those individuals in their capacity as users of our website. Separate privacy disclosures will be made to these parties during their application and onboarding processes.
