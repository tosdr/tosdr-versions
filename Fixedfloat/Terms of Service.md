Please read these terms of service (the "Terms") carefully before using our Service. By accessing or using any part of the site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree with these Terms or any of its Clauses, you shall immediately cease to use any FixedFloat services.

### Section 1 General Provisions

1.1.These Terms constitute a legal agreement between us ("**FixedFloat**", "**We**", "**Us**", "**Ourselves**") and users, clients, visitors and others (without limitation), who access the Services (as defined below) ("**User**", "**You**", "**Your**").

1.2.The FixedFloat services ("**Service**") refers to the services provided to you by FixedFloat, which are offered through the fixedfloat.com website ("**Website**"), widgets and mobile applications.

1.3. FixedFloat offers an exchange of cryptocurrencies ("**Exchange**"), based on an order ("**Order**") that was created by the User in the Service.

1.4. One of the parameters of the Order is the exchange rate type: fixed ("**Fixed rate**") or floating ("**Float rate**") type of exchange rate. Fixed rate involves fixing the exchange rate: the User receives the exact amount that was displayed when creating the Exchange. Float rate implies a change in the exchange rate depending on market conditions. The exchange rate is finally set when the User's transaction receives the required number of blockchain network confirmations.

1.5. The headings used in this agreement are included for convenience only and will not limit or otherwise affect these Terms.

1.6. If the User does not read and accept the Terms of Service, the User should not use or continue using the Services.

### Section 2 Using of Service

2.1. You hereby confirm that you are an individual, legal person or other organization with full capacity for civil rights and civil conduct when you use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence or you have consent from your legal representative or guardian to use the Service.

2.2. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service or any contact on the Website through which the service is provided, without express written permission by us.

2.3. To make an Exchange, the User must create an Order with a choice of direction, amount, type of exchange and an indication of the User's address, to which the funds should be received during the Exchange, and send funds to a specially generated address (or a combination of an address and a MEMO/Destination tag) on the Order page.

2.4. Only one transaction is allowed per address.

2.5. By choosing Fixed rate, you acknowledge and agree that FixedFloat will execute Exchange and send the exact amount that was displayed on the order page when it was created, if the following conditions are met:

● You sent funds and the transaction got into the mempool or block of the blockchain network within 10 minutes from the moment the order was created.

● You sent the exact amount that was displayed on the Order page, which does not include network fees and withdrawal fees.

● The market rate from the moment the Order was created to the appearance of the transaction in the mempool of the blockchain network was not changed by more than 1.2%

Otherwise, the execution of the order with the payment of the exact amount that was displayed on the page of the created order before payment will be impossible. You will be able to make a choice on the order page: continue the order at the new market fixed rate at the time of the choice (when possible) or make a refund minus the network commission.

2.6. By choosing the Float rate, you acknowledge and agree that the exchange rates for the Float rate type are approximate and change over time. The service fee and the network fee for consolidating an incoming transaction, as well as for sending a transaction, are already included in the final displayed rate. The exchange rate is finally set within 10 minutes after your transaction receives the required number of confirmations in the blockchain network.

2.7. If the User's transaction does not arrive at the Service address after 30 minutes for an Order with a Float rate and after 10 minutes for an Order with a Fixed rate, the Order automatically switches to the "Order expired" status. If funds are received before 24 hours have passed since the creation of the Order, the User's transaction is automatically displayed in the Order. The User can choose on the Order page: continue the Order at the current market rate and or make a refund minus the network commission.

2.8. Sending a transaction on an Order after 24 hours has passed since the creation of the Order is a violation of the Exchange rules.

2.9. The minimum and maximum allowable actual amount for Exchange is always displayed on the main page of the site in the "Send" and "Receive" fields. Sending a transaction on an Order, the amount of which is less than the minimum limit, is prohibited and is a violation of the Exchange rules.  
When sending a transaction for an Order, the amount of which exceeds the maximum limit of the Service, a form will be available on the Order page for the User to automatically return a part of the amount that exceeds the original amount of the created Order, while the other part of the amount will be exchanged.

2.10. When creating an Order, the User is fully responsible for the correctness of the chosen direction of the Exchange, the specified receiving address, the type of exchange rate and amount, as well as for being aware of the features of the selected currencies and networks. FixedFloat is not responsible if the transaction was sent to incorrectly specified details when creating an order. To make sure in the chosen direction and the details entered when creating the Order, the User can specify his email address to receive notifications about the status of the Order, containing all information about the Order, before the direct payment of the Order.

2.11. Automatic refund through the form on the Order page to the addresses of the Service, including the addresses of other Orders, is prohibited and is a violation of the Exchange rules.

2.12. You acknowledge and agree that you must send funds in a single transaction for the Order you have created in the same currency and blockchain network that was selected when creating the Order.

2.13. Sending funds to the address specified in the Order in a currency and/or blockchain network other than that specified in the Order is a violation of the Exchange rules.

2.14. You acknowledge and agree that Orders are executed fully automatically and when the User contacts technical support with a request to suspend the Order, change the Order data or refund the funds that were sent by the User for the Order, FixedFloat has the right to refuse this request without giving reasons.

2.15. Suspension of the User's Order in order to change the receiving address or return the funds that were sent by the User under the Order is possible only if, when creating the Order, the User indicated his email address to receive notifications about the status of the order or if the User created the exchange from his registered account. The user must send an email from their email address with information about the required changes. The term for consideration of the request is 24 hours after the Order is suspended and the FixedFloat email is received from the user.

2.16. Sending funds after 24 hours after the creation of the Order is a violation of the Exchange rules.

2.17. Creating an Order specifying the address of the Service from another Order is a violation of the Exchange rules.

2.18. Sending funds on the Order in more than one transaction is a violation of the Exchange rules.

2.19. Sending transactions to FixedFloat addresses via third-party smart contracts is prohibited and is a violation of the Exchange rules, unless it is expressly allowed on the Order page.

2.20. The possibility of exchanging or refunding funds in case of violation of the Exchange rules is described in section 4.

2.21. An order is accessed via a URL link containing the Order ID and data about the receiving address that was entered when the order was created. If the link to the Order or the Order ID is lost, the User can contact technical support to search for the Order. In this case, the User must provide complete data about his order, namely: the direction of the exchange being made; the transaction by which the funds were sent to the address of the Service; the receiving address that the User entered when creating the Order. If all the necessary data is not provided, the search for the Order will be refused.

2.22. If the User has created an Order and sent a transaction in accordance with the Terms of Use of the Service, but FixedFloat cannot perform an Exchange or return for its own technical reasons, the User is offered a solution based on the technical capabilities at the time of the request, which takes no more than 24 hours to complete.

2.23. If the User has created an Order and sent a transaction in accordance with the Terms of Use of the Service, but during the process of processing the Order, unforeseen and independent of FixedFloat factors occur that contribute to the non-fulfillment of the Order, the Order completion time in this case is not regulated and depends solely on the elimination of the relevant factors.

2.24. The Service provides non-custodial services, which means that we do not store your funds on deposits and balances.

2.25. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

2.26. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Website (or any part or content thereof) without notice at any time.

### Section 3 Prices and Exchange Rates

3.2. We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the service.

3.4. The number of transaction confirmations required for a transaction to be considered accepted for an Order is different for each of the cryptocurrencies. The required number of transaction confirmations is subject to change at the discretion of FixedFloat without notice.

### Section 4 Processing Orders in Violation of the Exchange rules

Violation of the Exchange rules makes it impossible to automatically process and fulfill the Order. For each case of violation of the Exchange rules, the User must contact the technical support on the site and register a request for manual processing by technical specialists.

4.1. Sending funds after 24 hours from the moment the Order was created

When sending funds for the Order after 24 hours after the creation of the Order, the transaction will be attached to the Order within 24 hours after the registration of the User's request. The User will be able to choose whether to continue the order at the market rate, at the time of attaching the transaction, or to make a refund.

4.2. Sending two or more transactions for one Order

For one Order, only one transaction is processed and double payment for the Order is prohibited. If two or more transactions arrive at the Order address, the Order is still executed only with the first transaction. The exchange of funds for other transactions at the current market rate at the time of manual processing of the Order or the return of funds minus the network commission is carried out within 24 hours after the registration of the User's request.

4.3. Attempt to make a double exchange

If, when creating an Order or when automatically refunding funds, the User indicated the address of the Service from another Order, then when contacting technical support, the User must provide his address in order to receive funds for exchange or return. Sending funds to the User's address is carried out within 24 hours after registration of the User's request. The total amount to be sent will be recalculated taking into account the additional expenses of the Service for the miner fee for sending the transaction and consolidating funds.

4.4. Sending or returning funds by the User to the address of our Service

If the User sent funds or the service returned funds to the FixedFloat address from which they were sent earlier, he must inform technical support about the transaction as a result of which the funds were sent and his address for the return of funds. Technical specialists have the right to demand proof that this transaction was sent on behalf of the User, if this fact is not obvious. Sending a refund to the User's address is carried out within fourteen (14) days after providing all evidence that the transaction was sent or initiated by the User.

4.5. Sending funds below the limit

If the User has sent a transaction, the amount of which is less than the amount of the Order and less than the minimum limit, a form will be available on the Order page for issuing an automatic refund to the User. FixedFloat reserves the right to refuse a refund.

4.6. Sending funds using a third-party smart contract

The service does not automatically process transactions sent through third-party smart contracts. When sending such a transaction, the User must inform technical support about it. The transaction will be attached to the order within seven (7) days after the registration of the User's request.

4.7. Sending funds to a blockchain network other than the one specified in the Order

4.7.1. If for the Order the currency was sent to the address of the Service in a network different from the one that was selected when creating the Order, and this network is supported by the Service, then the request will be processed within seven (7) days after the registration of the request. The user can choose to continue the order at the rate at the time of attaching the transaction, or make a refund.

4.7.2. If for the Order the currency was sent to the address of the Service in a network different from the one that was selected when creating the Order, and this network is NOT supported by the Service, then the request will be processed within thirty (30) days after the registration of the request. The User can only request a refund if the amount sent is equivalent to more than twenty (20) USD. The commission for the restoration of funds and their return depends on the complexity of the work to restore them and is set individually for each case, but cannot be less than ten (10) USD. FixedFloat has the right to refuse to refund these funds without giving reasons.

4.8. Sending funds in a currency other than that specified in the Order

4.8.1. If a currency other than that specified in the Order is sent to the address of the Service in the same network as the selected currency in the Order, and this currency is also supported by the Service, then the request will be processed within seven (7) days after the request is registered. The user can choose whether to continue the order at the rate at the time of attaching the transaction or to make a refund.

4.8.2. If a currency other than that specified in the Order is sent to the Service's address in a network other than the one selected when creating the Order, and this currency and network is supported by the Service, then the request will be processed within seven (7) days after the request was registered. The user can choose whether to continue the order at the rate at the time of attaching the transaction or to make a refund.

4.8.3.If a currency other than that specified in the Order is sent to the Service's address in the same network that was selected when creating the Order, but this currency is NOT supported by the Service, then the request will be processed within thirty (30) days after the request was registered. The user can only request a refund if the amount sent is equivalent to more than twenty (20) USD. To return funds, the User is obliged to pay a commission for sending a return (miner fee), as well as a service commission in the amount of ten (10) USD for making a return of sent funds.

4.8.4. If a currency other than that specified in the Order is sent to the address of the Service in a network different from the one that was selected when creating the Order, and this currency is NOT supported by the Service, but the network is supported by the Service, then the request will be processed within thirty (30) days after the registration of the request. The user can only request a refund if the amount sent is equivalent to more than twenty (20) USD. To return funds, the User is obliged to pay a commission for sending a return (miner fee), as well as a service commission in the amount of ten (10) USD for making a return of sent funds.

4.8.5. If a currency other than that specified in the Order is sent to the Service's address in a network other than the one selected when creating the Order, and the network is NOT supported by the Service, then the request will be processed within thirty (30) days after the request was registered. The user can only request a refund if the amount sent is equivalent to more than twenty (20) USD. The commission for the restoration of funds and their return depends on the complexity of the work to restore them and is set individually for each case, but cannot be less than ten (10) USD. FixedFloat has the right to refuse to refund these funds without giving reasons.

4.9.Sending funds for an Order as a transaction with incorrect parameters

Sending funds for an Order as a transaction with incorrect parameters. If the Order specifies the need to specify additional parameters when sending a transaction (such as MEMO, Destination tag, Comment and others), then sending a transaction on the Order without the specified parameters or with incorrect parameters may lead to an irretrievable loss of the User's funds. If the transaction was sent without specifying the required parameter, the User must report this to the technical support service, as well as provide evidence that this transaction was sent directly or initiated by the User. The evidence is a letter received to our mail from the official mail of the Service from which the transaction was sent. The email must contain confirmation that this particular User initiated the transaction. The commission for the restoration of funds and their return is 10% of the amount, but cannot be less than ten (10) US dollars. The term for consideration of the request is 14 days after the provision of all evidence. If the User and/or the Service from which the transaction was sent does not provide proof within 2 weeks, We will refund the funds to the address from which the transaction was received, without additional parameters (such as MEMO, Destination tag, Comment and others). FixedFloat has the right to refuse to return these funds without giving reasons. The user can only request a refund if the amount sent is equivalent to more than ten (10) US dollars.
