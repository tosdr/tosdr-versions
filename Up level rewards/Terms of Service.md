**RewardZone USA, LLC – Level Up Rewards Program** 

  

**Terms & Conditions** 

  

**Last Modified: 1/23/2022**

  

RewardZone USA, LLC ("Level Up", “we,” “us,” and “our”) operates this website (“Website”), as well as other websites (collectively, the “Websites”), where you can earn merchandise and/or gift cards (collectively, “Rewards”) by, as detailed below, registering and providing personally identifiable information, registering for and/or purchasing certain products and/or services (“Deals”) available on the Website from our advertiser clients (“Advertisers”), and completing the Reward claim process, which requires ID verification. 

  

By accessing and using the Website, you agree to and accept these Terms & Conditions, as well as our [Privacy Policy](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/policies/privacy) and any additional terms, conditions, and policies published on the Website (collectively, the “Agreement”). If you do not agree to and accept the terms of the Agreement in their entirety, you do not have permission to visit and/or use the Website.

  

**Mandatory Arbitration.**  These Terms & Conditions contain a mandatory arbitration provision, as detailed below, that requires you to arbitrate, individually, all disputes or claims that you may have with us, our parent, related parties, Advertisers or the persons to whom we share your contact information where you have given us your consent to do so (“Marketing Partners””), all of whom are third-party beneficiaries of the mandatory arbitration provision. Thus, for example, if you provide prior express written consent to be contacted via telemarketing or SMS/text messaging, any claims that you may have regarding any telemarketing or SMS/text messages that you receive from us or our Marketing Partners are subject to the mandatory arbitration provision. The mandatory arbitration provision also waives your right to participate in a class action or multi-party arbitration. There are two narrow exceptions to the mandatory arbitration provision: (1) you may opt-out by providing written notice of your decision to do so within thirty (30) days of the date that you first register on a Website; and (2) you may opt-out by filing a claim in Small Claims Court provided the requirements described below are met.

  

**How the Rewards Program Works.** To qualify for a Reward, you must: (1) be a U.S. resident, 18 years of age or older; (2) provide accurate registration information (including your name and contact information, i.e., valid residential, phone number and/or email addresses), and (3) **COMPLETE THE REQUIRED NUMBER AND LEVELS OF DEALS WHICH REFERS TO A GROUP OF DEALS ("LEVELS"), WHICH USUALLY REQUIRE PAID PARTICIPATION OR PAID SUBSCRIPTION**, within a sixty-day period that commences on the date that you complete your first Deal.  If one or more Deals that you select requires longer than 60 days to earn credit – for example, you must pay for a monthly subscription charge following a trial period - you will have the length of time required to earn credit for the Deal plus an additional 60 days thereafter to complete the requisite number and Levels of Deals. The requirements to get credit for a Deal are included in the text box that appears when you click on Deal.  **Once you have completed the required number and Levels of Deals to qualify for the Reward you have chosen, you must promptly complete the Rewards claim process, which requires Identity Verification, to claim and obtain your Reward.** Once you start the Rewards claim process, you must complete it within thirty (30) days.  

  

**Registration and Verification.** You must provide accurate registration information, including your name and contact information, i.e., valid residential and email addresses.

  

**Survey Questions.** While on the Website, you will be presented with survey questions. Completion of the survey questions is not required to earn or claim your Reward. If you do not wish to respond to survey questions, please simply select the “Skip the Survey” button which will bring you to the end of the survey section. To the extent that you elect to respond to survey questions and consent to telemarketing, information concerning your responses to the survey questions may be shared with our Marketing Partners. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, please see the terms on Telemarketing and Text Messages and the Privacy Policy. 

  

**Optional Offers.** While on the Website, you may be presented with optional marketing offers from our Marketing Partners. Completion of the optional marketing offers does not count towards your Reward requirements and is not required to earn or claim your Reward. Optional marketing offers are principally distinguished from Deals on the Website because they are described as “Offers” and do not appear on the various Levels on the Website.  

  

**Choose your Reward.** To earn your Reward, you must complete the number of Deals at each Level that correspond to the Reward value of your choosing. The program allows you to select or change your Reward value up until you begin the Rewards claim process. Once you start the Rewards claim process, you cannot change the Reward Value you selected. 

  

At each Level, you can choose to continue to complete Deals or claim a Reward and exit the program. You can complete Deals and claim Rewards at values of $5, $100, $250, $500, $750, and $1000 as set out below:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Reward Value (USD)** | **Total Number of Deals Required to Claim Reward** | **Number of Deals Required at Level 1** | **Number of Deals Required at Level 2** | **Number of Deals Required at Level 3** | **Number of Deals Required at Level 4** | **Number of Deals Required at Level 5** |
| $5  | 2   | 1   | 1   | \-  | \-  | \-  |
| $100 | 5   | 1   | 1   | 3   | \-  | \-  |
| $250 | 10  | 1   | 1   | 3   | 5   | \-  |
| $500 | 15  | 1   | 1   | 3   | 5   | 5   |
| $750 | 20  | 1   | 1   | 3   | 5   | 10  |
| $1000 | 25  | 1   | 1   | 3   | 5   | 15  |

  

**Complete Deals.** The various Levels and Deals are only available after you have completed the registration process, reviewed the survey pages or skipped the survey pages by clicking the "Skip" button that's on every page, and viewed optional offers which do not need to be completed to qualify for a Reward

  

To be credited with completion of a Deal, you must:

  

* access the Deal through the Website on a Deal page or through a valid link provided to you by customer support;
* complete the requirements to get credit for the Deal which are included in the text box that appears when you click on a Deal and/or in the Representative Deal Chart;
* use the same accurate contact information for completing the required Deals as you did during the registration process;  
* not have a third party (friend, relative, etc.) complete Deals for you; or 
* sign up for the same Deal more than once.  

  

If you do not complete all the required Deals during your initial visit to the Website, click the “Reward Status” button (located in the footer section of the Website’s landing page), log in, and use the provided link that will enable you to resume signing up for Deals. If you are unable to resume signing up for Deals via this method, please contact customer support for assistance. You should retain any confirmation emails or other documentation received applicable to the completed Deals so that, if requested, you can document completion of the required Deals.  

  

For a Deal that requires a subscription or purchase, the Advertiser must be able to successfully bill your credit card at least once or for the number of times specified in the Deal’s terms to receive credit. Many Advertisers will not accept prepaid cards to complete Deals or give credit for a “quick cancel.” (I.e., a cancellation prior to the Advertiser’s stated trial period).  For Deals that involve apps, in most cases it must be the first time you’ve installed the app on your device, and you may need to reach a certain level to get credit as specified in the Deal terms.  

  

Refer to the [Representative Deal Chart](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/policies/page/representative_offer_chart) for a brief description of most Deals, information on initial and ongoing commitments, and how to cancel.  

  

**Reward Status.** You can check on your progress at any time by logging in with your email address on Reward Status. It may take up to five business days for your completed Deals to display, so please be patient.  

  

**Proof of Deal Completion.** You must retain: 

* The original email, receipts, and confirmations for completed Deals. Copy and paste emails are not accepted. 
* Proof of payment including copies of bank or credit card statements. When you make copies of your statements, we ask that you cover your account number.  
* For mobile apps and games, we may ask for screenshots of your device’s home screen, the in-app screen showing the specific level reached, the account screen, and/or the app installation date from the App or Play Store.
* Receipts for in-app purchases, if a purchase was made. 

  

**Courtesy Deal Credit.** If a technical issue occurred through no fault of your own that prevented a Deal from automatically crediting to your Reward Status, we may grant a courtesy Deal credit with acceptable proof. Our customer support team is available to provide assistance with a courtesy Deal credit [here](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/contact). 

  

If we determine misuse or abuse of our courtesy Deal credit policy has occurred, we may revoke your right to request future courtesy Deal credits or forfeit eligibility for a Reward, and/or permanent suspension of your account. 

  

**Reward Claim Process.**  

  

**1\. Start Rewards claim process by clicking on the “Claim Reward” or “Cashout” popup notification.** Once you have completed the required number and Levels of Deals, a popup will appear alerting you that you are ready to proceed to the Reward claim process. Click on the popup to proceed to the Rewards claim process pages. Alternatively, you may log into the Website and click the “Rewards Status” button at the bottom of the page, also available [here](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/login?ReturnUrl=%2Fincentivestatus). Enter the email address you registered with and click on the “Check Reward status” button. If you have completed the required number of Deals in each of the relevant Levels (depending on the Reward you are seeking to claim), you will be eligible to start the Rewards claim process by clicking on the “Claim Reward” button.  

  

**2\. Verifying your Deals.**  Some Deals may require verification, such as “proof of completion,” to confirm that you completed certain Deals. See Proof of Deal Completion above. 

  

**3\. Submit claim ticket.** Once all Deals have been verified, accurately fill out and submit your claim ticket to start the Rewards claim process. Once you have submitted a claim ticket for a particular Reward, you may not change your Reward.  You must provide accurate information consistent with the information provided during the registration process to ensure the timely processing of your claim ticket. Failure to provide accurate information may result in processing delays and/or disqualification of your claim.  

  

**4\. Submit claim form and identity verification.** Once you submit your claim ticket, you will be prompted to verify your identity (“Identity Verification”). We use the information gathered in the Identity Verification process exclusively for fraud prevention and to ensure that Rewards are not earned through bots, automated processes, or fraudulent use of software or by users who engage in prohibited and/or fraudulent activities.  If you provide your prior written consent, we will ask you to upload a selfie (video or still image) and current government issued photo ID which will be used by our third-party service providers solely for Identity Verification.  This information will be deleted within 60 days. 

\[ES|F1\] If you do not consent to Identity Verification by our third-party service providers, we will provide alternative method which will consist of a manual Identity Verification review by our customer service team,  By continuing your participation in the Program, you agree that you will be required to pass Identity Verification to claim a Reward and our determinations made concerning Identity Verification are final.  

A Rewards claim will not be fulfilled if your identity has not been verified. 

  

**5\. Receive your Reward.** Within 72 hours of receipt of your claim ticket and verification submissions, we will issue an email to you regarding the status of your submission. If we have any questions concerning your submission, you will need to promptly respond and address those issues. Otherwise, your submission may remain incomplete and your time to claim the Reward may lapse. If you have any questions or concerns, you must promptly [contact customer service](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/contact) to address the same. Once you have successfully completed your submission, we will send you your Reward within 7-10 business days. We reserve the right to audit claims to ensure that only users who fully comply with these Terms & Conditions can claim a Reward. 

  

**6\. Substitution Policy.** We reserve the right to substitute a Reward of equal or greater value if the Reward you earned is unavailable for any reason. 

  

**7\. Lost, Stolen or Mis-Delivered Rewards.**  We are not responsible and will not replace any lost, stolen or mis-delivered Rewards unless the mis-delivery is clearly because of our error.

NOTE: We rely on our users providing accurate registration information so we and our Advertisers and Marketing Partners can connect with and market to our users. If your registration information (name, postal address, email address) does not match the information on your claim ticket and claim verification form, we reserve the right to disqualify you. In some instances, our system may pre-populate inaccurate registration information. If this happens, contact us [here](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/contact) and provide us with the correct information so we can provide instructions on how to correct this. 

  

**Limitations - Household Waiting Period Rule.** Rewards are limited to one Reward of any kind per person and household (persons living at the same residential address) per eligibility period.  You and the members of your household must wait sixty (60) days after submitting a claim completing all the Deals required for a Reward with a value of $100 or less starting when you submit a claim before becoming eligible for another Reward of any kind.  You and the members of your household must wait twelve (12) months after completing all the Deals required for a Reward with a value greater than $100 starting when you submit a claim for a Reward before becoming eligible for another Reward of any kind.  A household means a residence – where you live – and cannot be a PO box, where you work, or other non-residential address. We may ask you to prove your household address so we can ensure compliance with the rule depending on the Reward Level. 

  

**Limitations - Employees.** Employees of RewardZone USA, LLC and its parent, subsidiaries and related parties and its advertising, publisher, fulfillment, agency, and Marketing Partners, and their immediate families (including those living in the same households) are not eligible to earn a Reward. If we determine you are associated with RewardZone USA, LLC, we reserve the right to disqualify you.

**Telemarketing and Text Messages.** Where you provide “prior express written consent” within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), you consent to receive telephone calls, and text and SMS messages to the telephone number(s) that you provided from us and the Marketing Partners. You are not required to provide this consent to earn a Reward or purchase any of the other goods or services offered on the Websites. If you provide consent, we and any of the Marketing Partners may send you SMS messages from their short codes or long codes. Our short codes are 53294, 91982, 27367, 68766, and 411411; we may acquire additional short codes. Message Frequency Varies, maximum 15 messages per month. Message and data rates may apply.

Compatible carriers include: AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, Boost, Alltel (Verizon Wireless), U.S. Cellular, MetroPCS, T-Mobile ® United Wireless, Virgin Mobile, Boost Mobile, Cellcom, C Spire Wireless CellSouth, Cricket, Cincinnati Bell, and Virgin Mobile®. T-Mobile® is not responsible for delayed or undelivered messages. 

Further, where you submit your personal information to us, such act constitutes an inquiry for purposes of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”) (16 CFR §310 et seq.), and applicable state do-not-call regulations.  As such, even where your telephone number is listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the TSR and applicable state do-not-call regulations.

Any claims you may have under the TCPA and TSR against us or any of the Marketing Partners will be subject to the Arbitration/Dispute Resolution provision below.

  

**Privacy, Security and Links.** See our [Privacy Policy](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/policies/privacy), which is incorporated herein by reference, for more information concerning our collection and use of your information, the security of your information, and how to have your information deleted from our database. The Website contains links to other sites or services. For example, when you link from a survey question, optional offer, or Deal advertisement to another site, you are leaving the Website and are subject to the privacy policies and terms and conditions of those sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, content, or security of such third-party sites. 

  

**Publicity.** We may use your first name, last initial, and City and State of residence (for example John S. Wichita, KS) on a Website. We may also ask for a testimonial and/or a picture of you with your Reward. If you submit either, you grant us a royalty-free license to display and use what you submit to us in any medium. 

  

**Tax Liability.** You are responsible for all local, state, and federal taxes on any Reward you receive. 

  

**Agreement; Choice of Law/Jurisdiction and Venue.** You agree that these Terms & Conditions constitute the agreement between you and us, and that New York law controls, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. Any dispute that is not resolved by arbitration and proceeds in a state or federal court will be adjudicated in a court in the state of New York. You expressly waive any defense or objection to venue or personal jurisdiction.

  

**Arbitration/Dispute Resolution.** You agree to arbitrate all claims arising out of or related to the Agreement. If you have a dispute concerning any aspect of the Agreement, including without limitation, your participation in the Rewards Program or a telemarketing call or SMS/text message that you received from us or a Marketing Partner, you should first contact customer support on any of the Websites or complete a customer support ticket [here](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/contact). We will attempt to resolve the matter to your satisfaction within thirty (30) days of our receipt of a customer support ticket. We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer during this process. If we provide you with a final written settlement offer and you don't accept it, if we can't otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, or if you choose to skip this step, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in the county where you live by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration online by following the instructions at [https://apps.adr.org/webfile/](https://apps.adr.org/webfile/).

  

An AAA arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute or claims that you may have with us—and our Marketing Partners who are third-party beneficiaries of the mandatory arbitration provision—arising out of or related to the Agreement. Matters subject to mandatory arbitration include, without limitation, whether this Arbitration/Dispute Resolution provision applies to your claim or dispute, and any claim that all or any part of the Agreement, including this provision, are/is unenforceable. If the claim is against us, you will need our mailing address to file online. To obtain our mailing address, contact us by clicking [here](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/contact).

  

Either party may submit the dispute for resolution by arbitration at a location reasonably convenient to both parties. If either party files for arbitration, it will be conducted in accordance with the then current AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.  

If you proceed to arbitration against us, you will pay all AAA filing fees and we will pay for all administration and arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). For claims brought by you of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on submissions. The arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable relief, including injunctive relief. Any award will be final and conclusive to the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you initiate arbitration against us and the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our final written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will pay you a minimum recovery of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), plus we will reimburse any reasonable expenses incurred by your attorney, if any, including fees reasonably accrued for investigating, preparing, and pursuing the claim in arbitration. Although under some laws we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we agree that we will not seek such an award from you. You and your attorneys are not required to keep the results of the arbitration confidential. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in such a suit. 

  

**Class Action Waiver.** The arbitration provision contained in these Terms & Conditions does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining, or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement.  

  

**Exceptions to Mandatory Arbitration.** There are two narrow exceptions to mandatory arbitration. First, you may opt-out of the Arbitration/Dispute Resolution provision by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first register on any of the Websites. To obtain our mailing address, contact us by clicking [here](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/contact).

  

Second, you may choose to pursue your dispute or claim in Small Claims Court rather than by arbitration, but only if your dispute or claim qualifies for Small Claims Court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over both you and RewardZone USA, LLC is proper.

  

Other than these two exceptions, you must arbitrate any claims as provided above.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, VIA YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AS WELL AS YOUR RIGHT TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT OR MULTI-PARTY ARBITRATION BROUGHT AGAINST US, OUR MARKETING PARTNERS, OR ANY SERVICE PROVIDER USED BY US TO PROVIDE THE SUBJECT SERVICE.

  

**Policy Against Spam.** We require that all emails promoting the Websites are sent only to users who have agreed to receive such emails. We prohibit any advertising of the Websites using unsolicited “spam” emails. If an advertiser or other person advertising or promoting our Sites fails to comply with our “no spam” policy, we will take appropriate disciplinary action against such person up to and including terminating our agreement with such person. If you feel you’ve been sent unsolicited spam emails promoting a Website and would like to register a complaint, please let us know [here](https://contact.uplevelrewards.com/contact). We will immediately investigate all allegations of spam email and take appropriate action.

Please note that some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. We do not represent that your use of any content will not infringe the rights of any third parties. 

  

**Limitation of Liability.** To the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or relating to the Terms & Conditions, the Websites, or any Rewards, no matter how caused. In no event will our total cumulative liability to any user exceed an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the value of the Reward for which the consumer has registered, (ii) $1,000, or (iii) the actual dollar amount consumer spent on the Website and third-party sites completing sponsored Deals. 

  

**Liability Release**. By accessing one of the Websites or participating in our Rewards Program, you release us and our respective parents, subsidiaries, and other associated companies, and the directors, shareholders, officers, employees, or agencies of any of the above organizations, for any and all liability for any injury, death, loss, tax liability, or damage of any kind arising from your participation in the Rewards Program, or resulting from acceptance, possession, use, or misuse of any sponsored Deals or Reward.

  

**Indemnification.** You agree to indemnify and hold us, our parents, subsidiaries, and related parties, and each of their respective members, officers, directors, employees, agents, and/or other partners, harmless from and against any and all claims, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and settlement costs), damages, suits, costs, demands, and/or judgments whatsoever, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (i) your use of a Website, any service provided by us, user generated content (“UGC”) or Content; (ii) your breach of these Terms & Conditions; (iii) your violation of any rights including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights; or (iv) any deceptive, threatening, libelous, obscene, harassing, or offensive material contained in any of your email communications or other submissions to a Website.

  

**Updates.** We may revise these Terms & Conditions at any time. Your continued use of a Website and/or participation in the Rewards Program evidences your acceptance of any changes. If you do not accept any of the Terms & Conditions, you do not have permission to complete our registration process or access a Website.

  

**Trademarks.** All trademarks associated with the Deals and Rewards are the intellectual property of their respective owners. Those owners do not endorse, administer, or sponsor the Rewards Program or the Website.
