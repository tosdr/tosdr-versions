The European Wax Center mobile message service (the "Mobile Service") is operated by European Wax Center (“European Wax Center”, “we”, or “us”). Your use of the Mobile Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Mobile Terms”). We may modify or cancel the Mobile Service or any of its features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use of the Mobile Service following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.

By consenting to European Wax Center’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive marketing text messages from and on behalf of European Wax Center through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other technology. Service-related messages may include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).

You understand that you do not have to sign up for the Mobile Service in order to make any purchases, and your consent is not a condition of any purchase with European Wax Center. Your participation in the Mobile Service is completely voluntary.

We do not charge for the Mobile Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider.

You may opt-out of the Mobile Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to 95086 or click the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation text message. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If you have subscribed to other European Wax Center mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires otherwise, you will need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their respective mobile terms.

For Mobile Service support or assistance, text HELP to 95086 or email [guestservices@waxcenter.com](mailto:guestservices@waxcenter.com).

We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Mobile Service at any time and will notify you of these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.

The wireless carriers supported by the Mobile Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the Mobile Service with your new number.
