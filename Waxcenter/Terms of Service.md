Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).

You understand that you do not have to sign up for the Mobile Service in order to make any purchases, and your consent is not a condition of any purchase with European Wax Center. Your participation in the Mobile Service is completely voluntary.

We do not charge for the Mobile Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider.

You may opt-out of the Mobile Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to 95086 or click the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation text message. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If you have subscribed to other European Wax Center mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires otherwise, you will need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their respective mobile terms.

For Mobile Service support or assistance, text HELP to 95086 or email [guestservices@waxcenter.com](mailto:guestservices@waxcenter.com).

We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Mobile Service at any time and will notify you of these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.

The wireless carriers supported by the Mobile Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the Mobile Service with your new number.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any information sent through the Mobile Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance on the information or Mobile Service.
