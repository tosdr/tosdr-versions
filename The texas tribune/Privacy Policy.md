Introduction
------------

This Privacy Policy (“**Privacy Policy**”) explains how Texas Tribune, Inc. (“**The Texas Tribune**,” “**we,**” and “**us**”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information.

This Privacy Policy applies when The Texas Tribune collects data from guests (“**you**”) through the websites, mobile applications, software, and services controlled, whether partially or otherwise, by The Texas Tribune (the “**Services**”). If a service is co-branded or developed by a third party, the third party’s privacy statement may also apply.

We have included several annotations in boxes to help explain the legal jargon and emphasize key sections. These annotations are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

“**Personal Information**” includes information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you (e.g., name, address, telephone number, email address, and location). We do not consider “Personal Information” to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual. By disclosing your Personal Information to us or using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of it consistent with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy (which is expressly incorporated into any Service’s terms of use).

* use the Services; and
* communicate with us.

We also collect information, such as anonymous usage statistics, by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technology as you use the Services. When we link Personal Information with other information, we treat all of the linked information as Personal Information.

**Personal Information Collection**.

In general, you can visit the Services without identifying yourself or revealing any of your Personal Information. In a few areas on the Services, we ask you to provide Personal Information, such as your email address, first and last name, and address that will enable us to enhance your use of the Services or for purposes such as facilitating correspondence with you, registering your entitlement to access certain special features of the Services, in connection with your participation in promotions or special programs, or to complete transactions, including donations. It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Services.

**Outside Sources.** We may obtain information, including Personal Information, about you from third parties and sources other than the Services, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. For example, we may obtain commercially available demographic information from third parties or collect device ID information from your device as you use the Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Automatic Data Collection.** We and our vendors and suppliers may collect your usage activity, preferences, and browser details (such as your IP address and browser type) during your use of the Services.
