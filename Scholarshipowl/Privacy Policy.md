3\. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION AS A BUSINESS
--------------------------------------------

### a. Voluntary Disclosure

We may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you register with our Site(s)/Services, purchase a service, complete a scholarship application, claim a scholarship, leave a testimonial, communicate with us (online or offline), and at other times. You are not required to provide us your Personal Information; however, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Site or Services or we may not be able to fulfill your requested interaction.

### b. Cookies

We use cookies (a small text file placed on your device to identify your device and browser) to improve the experience of a Site and Services, such as keeping track of your activities on the Site, recognizing return visitors, and analyzing our promotions and Site traffic. Some third parties who advertise on our Site(s) may also use cookies similar technologies. Many web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Instructions for how to manage cookies in popular browsers are available at: [Internet Explorer](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Cookies), [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en&ref_topic=14666), [Safari (iOS)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [Safari (Mac)](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac), and [Opera](https://blogs.opera.com/news/2015/08/how-to-manage-cookies-in-opera/). However, certain features of our Site(s) or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies.

We use the following types of cookies:

* Session Cookies: Session cookies keep track of you or your information as you move from page to page within the Site/Services and are typically deleted once you close your browser.
* Persistent Cookies: Persistent cookies reside on your system and allow us to customize your experience if you leave and later return to the Site/Services. For example, persistent cookies may allow us to remember your preferences.
* Strictly Necessary Cookies: Strictly necessary cookies are, as their name suggests, necessary for the operation of the Site and/or Services. These are cookies that facilitate our compliance with laws, allow us to verify your identity before you access restricted areas of the Site/Services, manage our network, or keep track of user input.
* Advertising Cookies: Advertising cookies are used to learn more about you and advertise our products/services that might interest you; however, we do not use advertising cookies in a manner that would constitute cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising as contemplated by applicable privacy laws.
* Analytics Cookies: Analytics cookies help us understand how our Site and Services are working and who is visiting our Site or using our Services. Google Analytics is one tool we use, and you can learn more by reviewing [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

Depending on the circumstances, we may use cookies to collect Personal Information, Usage Data, or both.

### c. Tracking Pixels and Clear GIFs

We employ software technology that enables us to track certain aspects of a user's visit to a Site. This technology helps us better manage content on the Site(s) by informing us what content is effective, how consumers engage with the Site(s), and how consumers arrive at and/or depart from the Site(s). The software typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) "tracking pixels" and (2) "clear gifs." Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. We utilize tracking pixels provided by third-party social media platforms such as Pinterest, Facebook, and TikTok. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether or not a user has viewed a particular web page or email message. User activity information may be associated with additional information about a user's session, such as IP addresses and the type of browser used, and Personal Information, if provided by the user.

If you arrive at a Site by "clicking through" from another website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching that led you to that Site, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the Privacy Policy of any website from which you reached a Site to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information. We may retain information about you provided to us by other websites and will only use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Such information may be associated with other Usage Data or Personal Information.

We are not permitted to provide access to specific pieces of Personal Information if disclosure of the Personal Information creates a high risk of potential harm such as financial information, social security numbers, and driver’s license numbers. We will not provide specific pieces of Personal Information in response to a request unless you expressly request them.

### b. Right to Deletion

You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information we have collected about you. Please understand that we are not required to honor a deletion request if a legal exemption applies such as if we need the information to complete a requested or reasonably anticipated transaction, prevent security incidents or fraud, enable internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations, or comply with legal obligations.

### c. Right to Correct

You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we maintain about you. After you request to correct inaccurate Personal Information, we will provide instructions for you to provide us with optional documentation to support your request and we will consider it.

We may decline to correct your Personal Information if a legal exemption applies such as if we determine that your request is fraudulent or abusive or if we determine that the information we have on file is more likely than not correct. We may decide to delete your allegedly inaccurate Personal Information instead of correcting it.

### d. Right to Opt-Out from the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information

You have the right to direct us not to sell or share your Personal Information to Third Parties. Please note that opting out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information will not impact any sale or sharing of your Personal Information that may have occurred prior to the date of your request.

We will recognize browser-based opt-out signals as required by law, specifically Global Privacy Control. If we receive an opt-out signal and are able to identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal as a request to opt out of the sale or sharing of all Personal Information we have on file for the consumer and disable cookies and other tracking tools placed by Third Parties. If we receive an opt-out signal and are not able to identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal as a request to opt out limited to the Personal Information we collect from the consumer during the online session during which the signal is present and to disable cookies and other tracking tools placed by Third Parties.

If you are a Connecticut, Colorado, Utah, or Virginia resident, and you make a request to limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information as defined under your applicable state’s law, we will treat that request as a revocation of your consent for us to collect and process your Sensitive Personal Information and will delete your Sensitive Personal Information subject to any exemptions available under applicable law.
