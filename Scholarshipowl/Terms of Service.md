9\. Governing Law & Jurisdiction
--------------------------------

These Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with law of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any conflicts of laws provisions that would require the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby expressly reject any application to these Terms of Use of: (i) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, and (ii) the 1974 Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods, as amended. All disputes arising out of these Terms of Use not subject to binding arbitration (below) will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware, and the parties agree and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts, except that nothing will prohibit us from instituting an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain injunctive relief or protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or to otherwise protect our interests.

10\. Binding Arbitration
------------------------

Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use, the Site(s), and/or the Services, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a “Dispute”) will be solely and exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If the parties are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute by sending notice demanding arbitration to the other party. The demand for arbitration will be made within a reasonable time after the Dispute has arisen, but in no event will it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim, or facts forming the basis of the Dispute. The arbitration will be initiated and conducted according to American Arbitration Association rules and procedures for commercial arbitration, including, as applicable, provisions for the resolution of consumer disputes (the “Arbitration Rules”). The arbitration will be conducted in New Castle County, Delaware before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules, or such other location as the parties may agree in writing. A party may choose to participate in the arbitration by live video conference. The decision of the arbitrator will be final without option to appeal. Disputes with an amount in controversy of $10,000 or less will be determined on the basis of written submissions only. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive, special, consequential, or indirect damages against any party. Arbitration costs and fees will be divided in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Each party will be responsible for paying its own attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. No disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE; AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO PRESENT ITS CLAIM OR DISPUTE IN A COURT OF LAW EXCEPTING THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM OR DISPUTE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION RULES. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s), if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

12\. Supplemental Terms for Future Minds Fund Students and Donors
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following supplemental terms apply to your participation in the Future Minds Fund (“Fund”).

### 12.1 The Role of the Fund

The Fund will make available multiple scholarship opportunities for students. Scholarships will be funded via donations from us and individual donors. Through a fiscal sponsorship agreement with the Players Philanthropy Fund (“PPF”), donations are tax deductible to the fullest extent permitted by law. PPF is a Maryland charitable trust with federal tax-exempt status as a public charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (Federal Tax ID: 27-6601178). Your donation will be made to PPF and then earmarked for the Fund. The Fund allows donors to designate donations for particular student(s) of their choosing up to the maximum amount for which a student is eligible. Amounts donated above the maximum of a student’s eligibility or amounts donated designated for a student later determined by us to be ineligible, will be collected and pooled in one or more of scholarship funds and we will use such funds, along with undesignated funds and our donations, to award scholarships to students who have applied based on our evaluation of each student’s submission in conjunction with the applicable scholarship’s criteria, as described more fully below.

### 12.2 Scholarships Available Through the Fund

All scholarships available through the Fund require that student applicants be US citizens, permanent residents, or legal temporary residents at least 16 years of age who complete and provide all information requested as part of the scholarship application. If you are under 18 years of age, you must have parent or guardian consent to submit an application. Each student may only apply one time to each scholarship. Additional eligibility criteria apply for each scholarship as discussed more fully on the respective scholarship page.

We will award scholarships based on our determinations of greatest financial and personal need amongst applicants using information provided in applicant submissions, the scholarship’s eligibility criteria, and the goal of each scholarship. We will give preference to students who have written a compelling narrative and to students who have previously been awarded a scholarship by us either as part of the Fund or otherwise. We may award full or partial scholarships. Our scholarship award determinations are final.

If a scholarship is funded entirely by donor-designated donations, we will award the scholarship after the scholarship has been fully funded. If a scholarship has not been fully funded via donor-designated donations after thirty (30) days, we may, at any time in our sole discretion, elect to (i) pay out the partial scholarship based on the donor-designated donations or (ii) pay out a full or partial scholarship based on the donor-designated donations supplemented by other available funds in accordance with the scholarship award criteria above.

Scholarship recipients will have three (3) business days after notification to accept the scholarship and return all required documentation, otherwise the scholarship will be forfeited. If we determine after notifying a student that they have been awarded a scholarship but prior to payment of the scholarship that it was awarded in error or the student violated any of these Terms of Use, we may revoke the scholarship award upon notice to such student. The number of scholarships awarded within each category will vary based upon available funds. We may terminate the Fund at any time, with or without notice, upon awarding scholarships using available funds.

14\. Supplemental Terms for ScholarshipOwl for Business Users
-------------------------------------------------------------

The following supplemental terms apply to your use of ScholarshipOwl for Business, our scholarship application management system for businesses and non-profit organizations.

### 14.1 Personal Information Processing as Service Provider

We may collect and process certain information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is reasonably capable of being associated with scholarship applicants (“Applicant PI”) on your behalf. Subject to the limited license below in section 12.2, we will not sell Applicant PI; share Applicant PI for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes; retain, use, or disclose Applicant PI for any purpose other than the specific purpose of providing the ScholarshipOwl for Business Service to you or as otherwise permitted by applicable data privacy laws and regulations, including retaining, using, or disclosing Applicant PI for a commercial purpose other than providing the ScholarshipOwl for Business Service to you; retain, use, or disclose Applicant PI outside of the direct business relationship between you and us; or combine Applicant PI we process on your behalf with personal information we process on behalf of ourselves or third parties. The processing we undertake in connection with the ScholarshipOwl for Business Service includes collecting Applicant PI as directed by you and processing Applicant PI for the purposes of administering scholarships on your behalf. We will provide reasonable assistance to you in responding to legally valid data subject requests related to Applicant PI we collect and process on your behalf by providing you copies of and/or deleting Applicant PI we hold on your behalf. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for (i) informing us of such request and providing all information we need in order to assist you in response to such request and (ii) responding to data subject requests, and if we receive a data subject request relating to your Applicant PI, we may forward such request to you for response. We will use reasonable technical, organizational, and physical safeguards to protect Applicant PI we process on your behalf from unauthorized or unlawful access, disclosure, use, or deletion. We will treat Applicant PI we process on your behalf as your confidential information under an obligation of confidentiality. We will return or delete all Applicant PI we process on your behalf as requested by you at the end of your use of the ScholarshipOwl for Business Services unless we need to retain the Applicant PI for compliance with applicable laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that when not acting on your behalf we may also collect and/or process the personal information of an applicant on behalf of ourselves or another client and that all personal information we collect and/or process in that capacity is not considered Applicant PI.

### 14.2 Limited License to Use Applicant PI for Marketing Purposes

You grant us a limited, perpetual, global, non-revocable license to use Applicant PI for our own marketing purposes such as advertising other of our products or services to consumers. We agree that if a consumer whose Applicant PI we received from you exercises a right under applicable laws to prevent the sale of their personal information to third parties, and you provide us with notice of that request either through a tool we make available to you or through a written notice, we will not use such consumer’s Applicant PI for our marketing purposes and will only process it in accordance with our obligations in providing the ScholarshipOwl for Business Service to you.

### 14.3 Compliance with Privacy Laws

You and we will at all times comply with all applicable data privacy laws and regulations, including without limitation the California Consumer Privacy Act, California Privacy Rights Act, Connecticut’s Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring, Colorado Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act. You represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from and have provided all legally required notices to the individuals whose Applicant PI we collect and/or process on your behalf. If we determine that we are no longer able to comply with applicable data privacy laws and regulations with regard to our activities processing Applicant PI on your behalf or in our use of Applicant PI that you provide to us pursuant to section 12.2, we will provide notice of such determination to you within five (5) business days of making that determination. You may take reasonable and appropriate steps, at your own cost, to stop and remediate our unauthorized or noncompliant use of the Applicant PI.

### 14.4 Subprocessors

We will not disclose Applicant PI we process on your behalf to any third party (including subprocessors) without your prior consent. You consent to our disclosure of Applicant PI we process on your behalf to the subprocessors identified on our subprocessor webpage. We will notify you of any proposed changes to the subprocessors used by posting an update on our subprocessor webpage. You should regularly check the subprocessor webpage for changes. You will have ten (10) business days to object to each change beginning on the date we post the change to the subprocessor webpage (the “Objection Period”). If you do not object to the changed subprocessors by sending us written notice within the Objection Period, you will be deemed to have approved and consented to the changed subprocessor. We will not disclose Applicant PI we process on your behalf to a new subprocessor until the expiration of the Objection Period. If you object to a subprocessor, you and we will negotiate in good faith to resolve your reasonable concerns related to the subprocessor or arrive at a workaround plan. If you and we are unable to arrive at a mutually agreeable accommodation, you or we may immediately terminate your Account and use of the ScholarshipOwl for Business Service. We will have no liability to you for a termination as a result of inability of you and we to reach a mutually agreeable accommodation. In connection with any authorized onward transfer of Applicant PI we process on your behalf, we will (i) require by contract that the subprocessor not disclose the Applicant PI to any other third party and only process such Applicant PI for the purpose of providing services to us; and (ii) contractually impose upon the subprocessor data protection obligations that are at least as restrictive as those under these supplemental terms, including, but not limited to, the obligation to provide at least the same level of privacy and data security protection for such Applicant PI as is required under applicable data privacy laws and regulations.

### 14.5 Compliance Assessment

You may take reasonable and appropriate steps, at your cost, to ensure we process Applicant PI on your behalf in compliance with these supplemental terms and with applicable data privacy laws and regulations, including, no more than once per twelve-month period upon at least thirty (30) days advance written notice to us, conducting an assessment of our processing practices. You may use a third-party independent assessor to conduct the assessment so long as such third-party assessor agrees to confidentiality restrictions at least as restrictive as those in the Terms of Use. We will reasonably cooperate with such an assessment so long as you take reasonable efforts to minimize the burden of such assessment on our everyday business operations. We will also, upon your reasonable request and at your cost, provide you with information in our possession necessary to demonstrate compliance with these supplemental terms and applicable data privacy laws and regulations in connection with our processing of Applicant PI on your behalf.

### 14.6 Prematurely Canceling Scholarships

If you provide a scholarship using the ScholarshipOwl for Business Service, you are required to complete the scholarship process and award the scholarship in accordance with the terms you present to the applicants. If you cancel a scholarship offer prior to the originally published end date, you must award the scholarship to an applicant who applied prior to the cancellation of the scholarship. Failure to award scholarships may result in immediate termination and a prohibition against your future use of the ScholarshipOwl for Business Service.

### 14.7 Escrow

We may give you the option to escrow funds for disbursement to scholarship winners with the Future Minds Fund (“Fund”), a non-profit organization. You will not receive interest on the escrowed funds. After you determine the winner of your scholarship, and inform us of the winner, we will instruct the Fund to award the scholarship on your behalf. If (i) you placed funds to award as part of a scholarship offer into escrow with the Fund, (ii) you cancel such scholarship offer prior to the originally published end date after receiving at least one qualified application, and (iii) you do not select a winner(s) of the scholarship and inform us of the winner(s) within five (5) days after the date you canceled the scholarship offer, you authorize the Fund to disburse the escrowed funds to one or more applicants selected by the Fund in its sole discretion. If your scholarship does not receive at least one qualified application prior to its published end date or the date of cancellation (whichever is earlier), we will instruct the Fund to return the escrowed funds to you within thirty (30) days after the published end date or the date of cancellation (whichever is earlier). The Fund may also return the escrowed funds to you at any time in its sole discretion and without notice, and is under no obligation to escrow funds for you.

### 14.8 Cancellation

You may cancel your Account with the ScholarshipOwl for Business Service by (i) submitting a cancellation request through your Account on the ScholarshipOwl for Business Site; (ii) sending an email to support@scholarshipowl.com specifying the email address used for the Account and clearly indicating that you want to cancel, or (iii) calling customer service at 800 494 4908 Monday - Friday, 11a.m. to 6p.m. EST

### 14.9 Termination
