1\. Your relationship with TasksBoard

1.1 Your use of TasksBoard‚Äôs products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù in this document and excluding any services provided to you by TasksBoard under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and TasksBoard. ‚ÄúTasksBoard‚Äù means TasksBoard by EchoWave LLC, ROC Office, Jazeera, RAK, UAE. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with TasksBoard, your agreement with TasksBoard will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the ‚ÄúUniversal Terms‚Äù.

1.3 Your agreement with TasksBoard will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the ‚ÄúAdditional Terms‚Äù. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.

1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and TasksBoard in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the ‚ÄúTerms‚Äù.

1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.

4\. Provision of the Services by TasksBoard
