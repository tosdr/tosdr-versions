TasksBoard - Terms of Service

1\. Your relationship with TasksBoard

1.1 Your use of TasksBoard’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by TasksBoard under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and TasksBoard. “TasksBoard” means TasksBoard by EchoWave LLC, ROC Office, Jazeera, RAK, UAE. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with TasksBoard, your agreement with TasksBoard will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.

1.3 Your agreement with TasksBoard will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.

1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and TasksBoard in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.

1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.

2\. Accepting the Terms

2.1 In order to use the Services, you must firstly agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.

2.2 You can accept the Terms by:

(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by TasksBoard in the user interface for any Service; or

(B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that TasksBoard will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with TasksBoard, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the USA, UAE, or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.

2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.

3\. Language of the Terms

3.1 Where TasksBoard has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with TasksBoard.

3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.

4\. Provision of the Services by TasksBoard

4.1 TasksBoard has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”).

You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.

4.5 You acknowledge and agree that while TasksBoard may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by TasksBoard at any time, at TasksBoard’s discretion.

5\. Use of the Services by you
