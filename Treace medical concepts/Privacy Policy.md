**Cookies and Tracking Technologies.** A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies or similar technologies, such as web beacons and tracking pixels to analyze trends, administer our website, personalize content and ads, track users’ movements around our website to provide you with the most relevant browsing experience, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or of the service we provide as some of our features or services may not function properly without cookies.

We use the following cookies:

* **Strictly necessary cookies**. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.
* **Functionality/preference cookies.** These are used to recognize you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* **Statistical, analytical or performance cookies.** These allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
* **Marketing/targeting cookies.** These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests.
* **Third party cookies.** These cookies are placed on your device by a website from a domain other than our website. Please note that various third parties may also use these types of cookies, over which we have no control. These named third parties may include, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services. These third party cookies are likely to be analytical cookies or performance cookies or targeting cookies.

If you want to remove existing cookies from your device you can do this using your browser options. If you want to block future cookies being placed on your device you can change your browser settings to do this. Please bear in mind that deleting and blocking cookies may have an impact on your user experience as parts of the site may no longer work. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings to block cookies, our system may issue cookies as soon as you visit our site or click on a link in a targeted email that we have sent you, even if you have previously deleted our cookies.

In addition, we use web beacons and pixels, which are images that can be placed in web pages and some forms of email. These technologies can be used to deliver cookies and to collect information about your use of the site. Finally, we may also collect information through tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel or Javascript tag) that is placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows us to collect information regarding the use of the page of the site that contains the tracking pixel. We may use tracking pixels to trigger ads on participating websites based on activity tracked from the browser on a device used to visit our Sites. Other entities may have access to some of this information.

By using your website and services you affirmatively agree to the use of cookies disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

**Public Forums, Testimonials, and Patient Stories.** We offer features on our websites that allow users to connect and share their stories. You do not have to use these features, but if you do, please use common sense and good judgment when posting in these communities or sharing your information, photos, or videos with others. Please be aware that any personal information you choose to submit in any communities, forums, or reviews can be read, collected, or used by others, and could be used to send unsolicited messages to you. Despite our safety and privacy controls, we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter inappropriate or illegal conduct from others when using the Services.

However, we routinely conduct business with medical practices, and as a result, situations arise when we may receive and store identifiable patient health information. We do so in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including those under HIPAA and the HITECH Act. For more information on your healthcare provider’s information-sharing practices, please contact the provider’s office.

        **vii. Right to Non-Discrimination for Exercising Your Rights****.** If you choose to exercise any of your rights, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us.

     **B. How to Exercise Your Rights to Know, Correct and Delete**

You may submit requests regarding your rights to know, delete and correct, described above, by clicking [Your California Privacy Choices](https://www.lapiplasty.com/california-consumer-privacy-act/), by email to [privacy@treace.net](mailto:privacy@treace.net) or by calling us at 1-877-360-3232. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with the requests to know, delete and/ or the correct. Our verification procedure may differ depending on whether you have an account with us or not and the request you are making. The following generally describes the verification processes we use:

* * * **Password Protected Accounts.** If you have a password-protected account with us, we may use existing authentication practices to verify your identity but will require re-authentication before disclosing, correcting or deleting data. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity relating to your account, we will require further verification (as described below) before complying with a request to know or delete.
        * **Verification for Non-Accountholders.** If you do not have, or cannot access, a password-protected account with us, we will generally verify your identity as follows:
        * * For _requests to know categories of personal information_, we will verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty by matching at least two data points provided by you with reliable data points maintained by us.
            * For _requests to know specific pieces of personal information_, we will verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty by matching at least three data points provided by you with reliable data points maintained by us.  We will also require a declaration, signed under penalty of perjury, that the person requesting the information is the person whose information is the subject of the request or that person’s authorized representative.  We will maintain all signed declarations as part of our records.
            * For _requests to correct or delete personal information_, we will verify your identity to a reasonable degree or a reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the sensitivity of the personal information and the risk of harm posed by unauthorized deletion.  We will act in good faith when determining the appropriate standard to apply.

If there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity, we will state so in response to a request to know or delete personal information, including an explanation of why we have no reasonable method to verify your identity.

If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to know, delete or correct, we may require the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit the request. We may also require you to do either of the following: (1) verify your own identity directly with us; or (2) directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. This requirement does not apply if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4121 to 4130.

We will respond to requests to know, requests to delete and / or delete no later than 45 calendar days. If we cannot verify your request within 45 days, we may deny your request. If necessary, we may take up to an additional 45 days to respond to your request but in such an event will provide you a notice and an explanation of the reason that we will take more than 45 days to respond to your request.

Nevada law provides that Nevada residents may opt-out of the “sale” of “covered information” to third parties, including but not limited to name, address, social security number, and online service activity.
