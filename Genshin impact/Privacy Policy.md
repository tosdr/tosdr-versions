**Cross-border data transfer**

As a global company, COGNOSPHERE may transfer your personal data to our affiliates, third party service providers and partners that operate around the world, which are located in countries other than the country in which you are resident (e.g. Singapore). These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area and the UK, which have been formally recognised as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant “adequacy decisions” from the European Commission, where applicable.

Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The safeguards we use are the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as issued on 4 June 2021, including the UK Addendum, and/or the UK International Data Transfer Agreement permitted under Article 46 of the UK GDPR. This is how transfers of personal information between us and other companies will be safeguarded.  All companies are required to protect personal information that they process from Europe in accordance with European Union data protection law. Transferred personal information includes basic information such as your name or contact information such as your email address.

**Children's Notice**

Our Services are not marketed to, or intended for, children.  Children for the purposes of our Services are (a) under the age of 13 years old or, if older (b) between 13 and 18 years old but under the age at which they can give valid digital consent to processing of their personal information under applicable data privacy laws. We strive to follow the different minimum age guidelines set by the laws of individual regions when determining the age that children can access certain features of our Services.

Children are not permitted to use these Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Though our Services are not intended for children as the primary audience, we may collect age information before allowing a user to proceed for certain Services. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information about a child that is not subject to an exemption under applicable privacy law, we will take measures to promptly remove that information from our records.

**Data Protection Supervisory Authority**

To lodge a complaint with your national or regional data protection supervisory authority, please contact the competent authority.
