[California Consumer Privacy Act Rights and Additional Information](#top-of-page)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Residents of California are afforded specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). These rights are discussed below and apply _only_ to residents of California.

Your Rights

California residents have the following rights related to their Personal Information:

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to request that we disclose the following to you: (1) the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you; (2) the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you; (3) the categories of sources from which we have collected your Personal Information; (4) the categories of Personal Information we have disclosed for a business purpose; and (5) the categories of third parties to whom we have shared your Personal Information. You also have the right to request that we disclose the business purpose(s) for collecting or sharing your Personal Information.
* **Right to Access.** You have the right to access the Personal Information we hold about you. When requested (as described below), we will provide, free of charge, the Personal Information as required by the CCPA. To the extent possible, the information will be provided in a portable and commonly used format so that it can be transferred to another entity.
* **Right to Request Deletion.** In certain circumstances, you have the right to request the erasure of your Personal Information. Upon verifying the validity of your deletion request, we will delete your Personal Information from our records, and direct any service providers to delete your information, as required by the CCPA.
* **Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information.** You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information. To exercise the right to Opt-Out, please click on the DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION button [DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION](#)
* **Right to Non-discrimination.** You have the right not to be discriminated against in service or price if you exercise any of your CCPA data privacy rights.

Please note that the above rights are not absolute, and Prestige may be entitled to refuse or limit the requests, where exceptions under the applicable law apply.

Exercising Your Rights under the CCPA

You can exercise any of your rights as described in this Privacy Policy and under applicable data protection laws by contacting Prestige as provided in the **Contact Details** section above. Prestige will not discriminate against you for exercising such rights.

Except as provided under the CCPA, there is no charge for the exercise of your legal rights. However, if your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, Prestige may either: (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request.

Verifying Consumer Requests

Prestige verifies each data subject access request individually and confirms that the request is made by the individual owner of the email address used for or provided in connection with such request. If Prestige is not reasonably able to confirm the identity of the person making the request, we may require additional information in order to confirm such identity. Where Prestige has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the person making the request, we may deny and closeout such request.
