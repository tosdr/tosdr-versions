You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including our directors, officers, agents, partners, members, stockholders, and employees (collectively herein, “us” or “we”), from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (1) your use of our Website; (2) your breach of these Terms of Use; (3) your violation of the rights of a third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights and privacy rights, in connection with the use of our Website; (4) any overt harmful act toward any other user of our Website; and/or (5) your Feedback.

We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.

**9\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION**
--------------------------

**a. Binding Arbitration**

We hope we never have a Dispute with you. However, if we do, in order to expedite any such Dispute’s resolution and control the cost, you and we agree first to attempt to negotiate any dispute (except for “Excepted Disputes” expressly provided below) informally for at least sixty (60) days. If you have a Dispute with us, you may notify us at the Contact Us information further below. Please provide us with your name, how to contact you, what your concern is, and how you would like your concern resolved. After sixty (60) days, we may commence an arbitration if the Dispute is not resolved. Any appeal of an arbitration award, to the extent permitted below, must be made before the state or federal courts of Westchester County, New York. This arbitration agreement shall survive the termination of your relationship with us.

For this section, “Dispute” means any claim or controversy between you and us relating to, arising out of, directly or indirectly, in connection with, or concerning our Website, including without limitation our Privacy Notice and/or these Terms of Use, or under any theory of recovery including contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or common or civil law.

**Excepted Disputes.** Disputes involving or concerning (a) the enforcement, validity, or protection of our intellectual property, (b) relating to or arising from allegations of theft, piracy, plagiarism, or unauthorized use of our Website against you; and/or (c) any claim for injunctive relief are not subject to the binding arbitration hereunder. Such Disputes, however, must be made before the state or federal courts of Westchester County, New York, and remain subject to the class action waiver set forth further below.

**Small Claims Court.** Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis under the above class action waiver, and subject to a potential collective damages award of $15,000 (USD) or less.

**b. Arbitration Procedure**

Arbitration of any disputes arising under these Terms of Use are subject to the sole discretion of Prestige. If arbitration is elected, you and we agree to binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not before a court, judge, or jury. The arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The venue for arbitration shall be Westchester County, New York. Each party shall be responsible for their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings.

The Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in Westchester County, New York, state or federal courts. You agree that application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.

AAA shall conduct the arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in effect upon first notice of a Dispute and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow New York law. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, or upon subsequent agreement of the Parties, the arbitration will take place in Westchester County, New York. _The parties may litigate in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to enforce an arbitration award._

**30-day Right to Opt-Out.** You have the right to opt out of the provisions of these Terms that mandate arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to privacy@PrestigeBrands.com within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to a version of these Terms of Use containing an arbitration provision. Your notice must include your name, postal address, and email address, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of arbitration, all other parts of these Terms of Use will continue to apply to you. Opting out of arbitration has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter into in the future, with us, including if your originally did not op-out of arbitration when you agreed to these Terms of Use.

###### c. Class Action Waiver.

_Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts on a representative capacity are not allowed. Nor is it allowed to combine the proceedings of two or more individuals without prior consent of all parties._ ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CAN’T BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. This class action waiver agreement shall survive the termination of your relationship with us.

**d. Limited Time to Commence a Dispute.** In no event shall any Dispute brought hereunder by either party be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.

**e. Forum Selection Cause.** If these provisions are found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of the provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided solely and exclusively by the state or federal courts located in Westchester County, New York. The Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in Westchester County, New York, state or federal courts. You agree that application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.

**10\. MISCELLANEOUS**
----------------------

_**a. Governing Law.**_ These Terms of Use and your use of our Website are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law principles or international conventions, including without limitation the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act or the U.N. Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

_**b. California Residents.**_ If any complaint with us is not satisfactorily resolved, you can contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834 or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254.

_**c. No Waiver.**_ Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

_**d. Survival.**_ In the event of termination of our relationship, including your right to access or use our Website, whether by you or by us, the following sections of these Terms of Use shall survive: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

_**e. No Relationship.**_ There is no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of our Website.

**f. Drafting.** You agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.
