### Your Order

You fully understand and agree that you will become a member of our development team at Mabuhay Network LLC, and that your device registration is provided as a free benefit of your membership. We reserve the right to revoke your membership at any time. You are not directly purchasing a UDID registration or app downloads. Your purchase covers the time and resources it takes for us to add you to our team and provide support.

### Refunds

You fully understand that we are under no obligation to refund any order. Due to Apple's policies, a registration can't be removed once it has been submitted. If you fraudulently dispute the payment for an order, we will disable your access to our service and pursue legal action.

### Software
