Atlassian Customer Agreement
============================

[Download PDF](https://wac-cdn-bfldr.atlassian.com/K3MHR9G8/as/wzpcqw4mgmtncj59k5gmrxk/ACA_October_2024)

_Effective starting:  October 15, 2024_

This Agreement is between Customer and Atlassian. “**Customer**” means the entity on behalf of which this Agreement is accepted or, if that does not apply, the individual accepting this Agreement. “**Atlassian**” means the Atlassian entity that owns or operates the Products that Customer uses or accesses listed at [https://www.atlassian.com/legal/product-terms.](https://www.loom.com/legal/product-terms)

**If you (the person accepting this Agreement) are accepting this Agreement on behalf of your employer or another entity, you agree that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to this Agreement, and (ii) you agree to this Agreement on behalf of your employer or such entity.**  

**If you are accepting this Agreement using an email address from your employer or another entity, then: (i) you will be deemed to represent that party, (ii) your acceptance of this Agreement will bind your employer or that entity to these terms, and (iii) the word “you” or “Customer” in this Agreement will refer to your employer or that entity.**  

**By clicking on the “Agree” (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you at the time of placing an Order, downloading Products, or by using or accessing the Products, you confirm you are bound by this Agreement. If you do not wish to be bound by this Agreement, do not click “Agree” (or similar button or checkbox), download the Products, or use or access the Products.**

### 1\. Overview

This Agreement applies to Customer’s Orders for Products and related Support and Advisory Services. The terms of this Agreement apply to both Cloud Products and Software Products, although certain terms apply only to Cloud Products or Software Products, as specified below. In addition, some Products are subject to additional Product-Specific Terms, and Support and Advisory Services are subject to the applicable Policies.

### 2\. Use of Products

2.1. Permitted Use.  Subject to this Agreement and during the applicable Subscription Term, Atlassian grants Customer a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the Products and related Support and Advisory Services for its and its Affiliates’ internal business purposes, in accordance with the Documentation and subject to Customer’s Scope of Use, as specified in the Order and the Product-Specific Terms.

2.2. Restrictions.  Except to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, Customer must not (and must not permit anyone else to): (a) rent, lease, sell, distribute or sublicense the Products or (except for Affiliates) include them in a service bureau or outsourcing offering, (b) provide access to the Products to a third party, other than to Users, (c) charge its customers a specific fee for use of the Products, but Customer may charge an overall fee for its own offerings (of which the Products are ancillary), (d) use the Products to develop a similar or competing product or service, (e) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Products, (f) modify or create derivative works of the Products, (g) interfere with or circumvent Product usage limits or Scope of Use restrictions, (h) remove, obscure or modify in any way any proprietary or other notices or attributions in the Products, or (i) violate the Acceptable Use Policy.

2.3. DPA.  The DPA applies to Customer’s use of Products and related Support and Advisory Services and forms part of this Agreement. 

### 3\. Users

3.1. Responsibility.  Customer may authorize Users to access and use the Products, in accordance with the Documentation and Customer’s Scope of Use. Customer is responsible for its Users’ compliance with this Agreement and all activities of its Users, including Orders they may place, apps and Third Party-Products enabled, and how Users access and use Customer Data.

3.2. Login Credentials.  Customer must ensure that each User keeps its login credentials confidential and must promptly notify Atlassian if it becomes aware of any unauthorized access to any User login credentials or other unauthorized access to or use of the Products. 

3.3. Domain Ownership.  Where a Cloud Product requires Customer to specify a domain (such as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) for the Cloud Product’s or a feature’s operation, Atlassian may verify that Customer or an Affiliate owns or controls that domain. Atlassian has no obligation to provide that Cloud Product or feature if Atlassian cannot verify that Customer or an Affiliate owns or controls the domain. Product administrators appointed by Customer may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to Customer’s domain, which become “managed accounts” (or similar term), as described in the Documentation

3.4. Age Requirements.  The Products are not intended for use by anyone under the age of 16. Customer is responsible for ensuring that all Users are at least 16 years old.

### 4\. Cloud Products

This Section 4 only applies to Cloud Products.

4.1. Customer Data.  Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement.

4.2. Security Program.  Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures. Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures. Further information about Atlassian’s security program is available on the Atlassian Trust Center at [https://www.atlassian.com/trust](https://www.loom.com/trust), as updated from time to time.

4.3. Service Levels.  Where applicable, service level commitments for the Cloud Products are set out in the Service Level Agreement.

4.4. Data Retrieval.  The Documentation describes how Customer may retrieve its Customer Data from the Cloud Products.

4.5. Removals and Suspension. Atlassian has no obligation to monitor Customer Data. Nonetheless, if Atlassian becomes aware that: (a) Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others (including relating to a takedown request received following the guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations at [https://www.atlassian.com/legal/copyright-and-trademark-violations](https://www.loom.com/legal/copyright-and-trademark-violations)), or (b) Customer’s use of the Cloud Products threatens the security or operation of the Cloud Products, then Atlassian may: (i) limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or (ii) suspend Customer’s or any User’s access to the relevant Cloud Products. Atlassian may also take any such measures where required by Law, or at the request of a governmental authority. When practicable, Atlassian will give Customer the opportunity to remedy the issue before taking any such measures.

### 5\. Software Products

This Section 5 only applies to Software Products.

5.1. Modifications.  Atlassian may provide some portions of the Software Products in source code form for Customer to use internally to create bug fixes, configurations or other modifications of the Software Products, as permitted in the Documentation (“**Modifications**”). Customer must keep such source code secure (on computer devices and online repositories controlled by Customer), confidential, and only make it available to Customer’s employees who have a legitimate need to access and use the source code to create and maintain Modifications. Customer may only use Modifications with the Software Products, and only in accordance with this Agreement, including the Third-Party Code Policy, the Documentation, and Customer’s Scope of Use. Customer must not distribute source code or Modifications to third parties. Customer must securely destroy the source code at the earliest of: (a) Customer no longer needing to use source code to create or maintain Modifications, (b) termination or non-renewal of a relevant Subscription Term, or (c) Atlassian’s request for any reason. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Atlassian has no support, warranty, indemnity or other responsibility for Modifications.

5.2. License Verification. Upon Atlassian’s written request, Customer will promptly confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer’s use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer’s Scope of Use, provided Atlassian gives Customer reasonable advance notice and uses reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to Customer. If Customer exceeds its Scope of Use, Atlassian may invoice for that excess use, and Customer will pay Atlassian promptly after invoice receipt.  

5.3. Number of Instances.  Unless otherwise specified in the Order or the Product-Specific Terms, Customer may install up to one (1) production instance of each Software Product included in an Order on systems owned or operated by Customer or its Users. 

### 6\. Customer Obligations

6.1. Disclosures and Rights.  Customer must ensure it has made all disclosures and obtained all rights and consents necessary for Atlassian to use Customer Data and Customer Materials to provide the Cloud Products, Support or Advisory Services. 

6.2. Product Assessment.  Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use.

6.3. Sensitive Health Information and HIPAA.  Unless the parties have entered into a ‘Business Associate Agreement,’ Customer must not (and must not permit anyone else to) upload to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to process) any patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

7\. Third-Party Code and Third-Party Products
---------------------------------------------

7.1. Third-Party Code. This Agreement and the Third-Party Code Policy apply to open source software and commercial third-party software Atlassian includes in the Products.

7.2. Third-Party Products. Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“**Third-Party Products**”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.

### 8\. Support and Advisory Services

Atlassian will provide Support and Advisory Services as described in the Order and applicable Policies. Atlassian’s provision of Support or Advisory Services is subject to Customer providing timely access to Customer Materials and personnel reasonably requested by Atlassian.

### 9\. Ordering Process and Delivery

No Order is binding until Atlassian provides its acceptance, including by sending a confirmation email, providing access to the Products, or making license or access keys available to Customer. No terms of any purchase order or other business form used by Customer will supersede, supplement, or otherwise apply to this Agreement or Atlassian. Atlassian will deliver login instructions or license keys for Products electronically, to Customer’s account (or through other reasonable means) promptly upon receiving payment of the fees. Customer is responsible for the installation of Software Products, and Atlassian has no further delivery obligations with respect to the Software Products after delivery of license keys.

### 10\. Billing and Payment

10.1. Fees. 

(a) Direct Purchases.  If Customer purchases directly from Atlassian, fees and any payment terms are specified in Customer’s Order with Atlassian. 

(b) Resellers.  If Customer purchases through a Reseller, Customer must pay all applicable amounts directly to the Reseller, and Customer’s order details (e.g., Products and Scope of Use) will be specified in the Order placed by the Reseller with Atlassian on Customer’s behalf. 

(c) Renewals.  Unless otherwise specified in an Order and subject to the Product, Support or Advisory Services continuing to be generally available, a Subscription Term will automatically renew at Atlassian’s then current rates for: (i) if Customer’s prior Subscription was for a period less than twelve (12) months, another Subscription Term of a period equal to Customer’s prior Subscription Term, or (ii) if Customer’s prior Subscription Team was for twelve (12) months or more, twelve (12) months. Either party may elect not to renew a Subscription Term by giving notice to the other party before the end of the current Subscription Term. Customer must provide any notice of non-renewal through account settings in the Products, by contacting Atlassian’s support team or by otherwise providing Atlassian notice.

(d) Increased Scope of Use. If Customer exceeds the Scope of Use purchased, unless otherwise agreed with Atlassian in writing, Customer must upgrade its subscription or pay for the increased Scope of Use. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Order, Atlassian will charge Customer for any increased Scope of Use at Atlassian’s then-current rates, which may be prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.

(e) Refunds. All fees and expenses are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. For any purchases Customer makes through a Reseller, any refunds from Atlassian payable to Customer relating to that purchase will be remitted by that Reseller, unless Atlassian specifically notifies Customer otherwise at the time of refund.

(f) Credit Cards. If Customer uses a credit card or similar online payment method for its initial Order, then Atlassian may bill that payment method for renewals, additional Orders, overages to scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.

10.2. Taxes. 

(a) Taxes Generally.  Fees and expenses are exclusive of any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding or similar taxes or levies that apply to Customer’s Orders. Other than taxes on Atlassian’s net income, Customer is responsible for any such taxes or levies and must pay those taxes or levies, which Atlassian will itemize separately, in accordance with an applicable invoice.
