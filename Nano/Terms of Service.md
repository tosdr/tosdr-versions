### Nano.org public discourse policy

Nano Foundation believes that a diverse community is best served by a free and open exchange of ideas. To ensure, at all times, that a robust and vibrant marketplace of ideas is maintained on our Site, we require all those who use our website to respect the limits set forth in this Policy. While we will endeavor to review any violations of this Policy on a case-by-case basis, we are a small organization and have finite resources to dedicate to reviewing communications that have been flagged for potential violations. Accordingly, there are occasions in which content will be removed under this Policy without explanation. We will endeavor to constantly improve upon the way in which we review the content on our Site.

If you believe that there is content on our website that violates our Public Discourse Policy please either use the flagging feature built into our website or email us with a link to the offensive content at: [info@nano.org.](mailto:info@nano.org)
