OverDrive Cookie Policy
=======================

This Cookie Policy describes what cookies and similar technologies are used on OverDrive websites and apps ("Services"), why they are used, and how you can control their use.

What are Cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are small data file identifiers that are transferred to your device or web browser. They allow OverDrive to recognize your device or web browser when you visit or use the Services.

What types of Cookies does OverDrive use?
-----------------------------------------

The Services may use the following types of cookies:

Required cookies:  
OverDrive uses first party cookies (i.e. cookies set directly by OverDrive to your device) that are strictly necessary. These are essential cookies that let you move around the Services and use their features. Without these cookies, core functionality cannot be provided. You cannot object to these cookies as otherwise the Services cannot be provided.

Performance and Reliability Cookies:  
These cookies allow us to monitor and improve the Service's performance and reliability. They alert OverDrive when the Service is not performing at expected levels.

Research and Analytics Cookies:  
These cookies help OverDrive understand user behavior within the Services. For example, they collect information about which features of the Services are most popular. This information helps OverDrive design a better experience for all users.

Does OverDrive use third party cookies?
---------------------------------------

Some Services may use third party cookies. Specifically, some Services use New Relic ([https://newrelic.com](https://newrelic.com/)) for performance and reliability. The Libby and Sora apps use Firebase ([https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/)). Some Services may use Google Analytics ([https://analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com/)) for research and analytics. Some Services may also use Google Ads ([https://ads.google.com](https://ads.google.com/)), HubSpot ([https://www.hubspot.com/](https://www.hubspot.com/)), or similar for remarketing.

How does OverDrive use cookies?
-------------------------------

OverDrive uses cookies for many purposes, such as to support the internal operations of the Services, make improvements to the Services, and to improve your experience. Some examples of how we use cookies include:

* Determining your library card authentication status
* Detecting your web browser language
* Displaying your indicated font preference
* Keeping you logged in as you navigate related webpages
* Monitoring performance-related issues
* Determining how many active installations of Services exist
* Tracking what OverDrive-hosted webpages you visit

What if you do not want cookies to be set on your device?
---------------------------------------------------------

If you do not want OverDrive-hosted websites to collect information through the use of cookies, you can set your web browser to block cookies. Each browser is different, so you should check your browser or device's "Help" menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You should note that if you block cookies from OverDrive-hosted websites, your ability to use or access certain functions may be impaired.

You can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and/or opt out of Google Ads by using Google Ads Settings.
