EULA (End User License Agreement)
=================================

**Last updated:**  **January 1, 2024**

Please read this User Agreement (“Agreement”) carefully before enabling EarnApp by Bright Data (“EarnApp”). By enabling EarnApp, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not enable EarnApp.

YOU CANNOT USE EARNAPP IF:

* YOU ARE NOT OF LEGAL AGE IN THE COUNTRY OF YOUR OFFICIAL ADDRESS OR IN ANY OTHER WAY LEGALLY INCOMPETENT TO FORM A BINDING AGREEMENT AS INTENDED HEREIN. 
* YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING EARNAPP OR PRODUCTS OF SIMILAR TYPE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, INCLUDING THE LAWS OF YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCY OR ONE YOU’RE USING THE APPLICATION AT;
* YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS SIMILAR TO THIS AGREEMENT BY LEGAL AGREEMENTS WITH YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER, MOBILE SERVICE PROVIDER, ETC., THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GOVERN HOW YOU CAN SHARE YOUR INTERNET TRAFFIC, IP, AND DEVICE’S RESOURCES;
* YOU ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OR HAVE DEVELOPED A COMPETING PRODUCT AND INTEND TO ACCESS THE APPLICATION FOR COMPETITIVE PURPOSES (E.G., MONITORING AVAILABILITY, PERFORMANCE, OR FUNCTIONALITY).

**Description of EarnApp**
--------------------------

EarnApp is a software component that uses your IP address and free resources to download a few web pages in the background from well known Internet sites, in consideration of payments made to you. This is done in a way that does not materially interrupt you. The webpages are then sent to Bright Data’s customers, who use them to, among others, improve their databases, offer better products, services and pricing.

EarnApp customizes your network settings by modifying the system settings on your device. By enabling EarnApp, you are incorporated to be part of the Bright Data network, and EarnApp calculates the credits you earn using a proprietary algorithm. Credits, if verified by Bright Data, may be redeemed for value.

Information regarding your use, credits and applicable rates can be found on the EarnApp dashboard (https://earnapp.com/dashboard) or FAQ page (https://earnapp.com/faq/).

**EarnApp+ (EarnApp Plus)**  
EarnApp also offers EarnApp Plus. EarnApp Plus is an EarnApp mode that uses your browser to download a few web pages in the background from well known Internet sites, in consideration of payments made to you on a real Google Chrome browser. This is done in a way that does not materially interrupt you. The webpages are then sent to Bright Data’s customers, who use them to, among others, improve their databases, offer better products, services and pricing.

Information regarding your use, credits and applicable rates can be found on the EarnApp dashboard (https://earnapp.com/dashboard) or [FAQ page](https://help.earnapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/12456135504657-How-much-will-I-get-paid-for-EarnApp-and-what-are-the-requirements-) .

**Referral Program**  
EarnApp also offers a referral program in which users are rewarded for recommending qualified installations (new customer downloads). A Qualified Installation is an installation of EarnApp by a third party referred by you.   
  
Earnings from referral programs will be added to EarnApp balance and will show in your dashboard.  
  
As EarnApp Plus is a fixed paid plan it is not part of the Referral Program. Commissions earned within the EarnApp Plus model do not apply as referrals.  
  
Information regarding your use, credits and applicable rates can be found on the EarnApp dashboard (https://earnapp.com/dashboard) or FAQ page (https://earnapp.com/faq/).  
  
  
  
**Privacy**

You understand that through your use of the EarnApp you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the applicable privacy policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information within the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Bright Data and its affiliates.

**Restrictions**

EarnApp is intended for use on personal devices only (such as personal computers, mobile devices, SmartTVs, etc. that are in actual use by you as part of your everyday life). For the avoidance of doubt, EarnApp should not be installed in hosting services (including personal /”home servers”) or on other non-personal use devices. Installing EarnApp on non-personal devices constitutes a violation of EarnApp’s terms of use.

In consideration for continued access to the EarnApp, you agree to adhere to the terms governing member conduct as written herein. You understand that your account and any Credits you have earned can be terminated or suspended at the sole discretion of Bright Data if Bright Data reasonably believes you have violated the terms of member conduct in any way. You understand that EarnApp and software embedded within EarnApp may include security components that monitor the use and conduct of users. You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the security measures, monitoring measures, or usage rules embedded into EarnApp. Any unauthorized modification of any kind of the software provided by Bright Data, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.

When using EarnApp, you agree not to:

1. cheat, defraud, game, mislead, misinform, trick, or deceive Bright Data in any way in order to accrue Credits or for any other reason;
2. attempt to fraudulently manipulate your accrual, retention, balance, or redemption of Credits;
3. impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, a Bright Data official, forum leader, guide or host, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;
4. forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any Content transmitted through the Bright Data Service;
5. interfere with or disrupt EarnApp or servers or networks connected to EarnApp, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to EarnApp, including using any device, software or routine to bypass our robot exclusion headers;
6. intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, national or international law, including, but not limited to, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any rules of any national or other securities exchange, including, without limitation, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, and any regulations having the force of law;

You acknowledge that Bright Data may or may not pre-screen content, but that Bright Data and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any content that is available via EarnApp. Without limiting the foregoing, Bright Data and its designees shall have the right to remove any content that violates applicable law, this Agreement or is otherwise objectionable.

You acknowledge, consent and agree that Bright Data may access, preserve and disclose your account information if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce this Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Bright Data, its users and the public.
