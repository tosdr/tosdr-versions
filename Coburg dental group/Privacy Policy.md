NOTICE FOR PATIENT’S OF COBURG DENTAL GROUP



Your Privacy



We respect your right to privacy and we have systems in place to ensure we comply with the

Australian Privacy Principles. This statement is a brief summary of our practice’s privacy

policy. Our complete policy is available on request.



Our practice Sydney Road Pracdent Services ABN 67 050 962 863 trading as Coburg

Dental Group collects health information about you in order to provide you with dental

services. Personal information collected such as your name, address, contact details, health

insurance and financial details are also used to address accounts to you, process payments,

collect unpaid invoices via an external collection agency and to contact you about our

services and any issues affecting your health care.



We may collect your health information from other health care professionals, or disclose it to

them if, in our judgement, it is necessary in the context of your care.



If you choose not to provide us with information relevant to your care, we may not be able to

provide a service to you, or the service we are asked to provide may not be appropriate for

your needs. Importantly, you could suffer some harm or other adverse outcome if you do

not provide us with relevant information.



We will securely store your records, such as x-rays, treatment and personal details, and any

other material relevant to your care. Our complete privacy policy sets out how you can

access or seek correction of your records.



Our privacy policy details how you can lodge a privacy complaint and how we will deal with

such a complaint.



For administration purposes, we may rely on service providers located outside Australia. We

will take reasonable steps to ensure that any offshore data transfer complies with Australian

privacy laws. Whilst our practice takes all reasonable steps to ensure security of your

information, we cannot guarantee secure transmission of information over the internet.



Our practice Privacy Officer can be contacted at the practice during business hours if you

have any concerns or questions about a privacy matter Jessica Mash on 03 9386 1805 or at
