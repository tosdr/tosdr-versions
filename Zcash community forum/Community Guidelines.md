[](#p-6-zcash-community-code-of-conduct-1)Zcash Community Code of Conduct
=========================================================================

Forum members should strive to be kind and respectful to each other. Ideally, your presence in the community should improve the experience for everyone by promoting teamwork and community participation.

* In the Zcash community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely. We expect that members will work towards collaboration, not conflict.
* New people don’t always know where to find information, so try to be as helpful as you can.
* Respect the privacy of PM (private message) conversations and the wishes of everyone involved.
* Mods will use a yellow color to show when they act in that role within a discussion.

[](#p-6-ruleshttpsforumzcashcommunitycomfaqrules-2)[Rules](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/faq#rules)
======================================================================================================

We understand the Zcash community is worldwide and diverse and we strive to promote thoughtful discourse and respectful interactions from all users. We are committed to making participation in this forum a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of a person’s…

* Level of experience.
* Gender identity and expression.
* Sexual orientation.
* Disability.
* Personal appearance.
* Body size.
* Race.
* Ethnicity.
* Age.
* Religion.
* Nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery.
* Personal attacks (aka Ad-homenum).
* Trolling and insulting or derogatory comments.
* Public or private harassment.
* Posting topics unrelated to Zcash (unless in the off-topic lounge)
* Doxxing: Publishing another person’s private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
* Soliciting web domain sales (even if related to Zcash).
* Posting links to phishing sites
* Posting spam or advertisements
* Creating multiple accounts as sockpuppets
* Posting solicitations for or about services considered illegal in the United States.
* Posting links to internet gambling operations. (It is a crime for internet gambling operations to accept bets from United States persons, and the Justice Department takes the position that people who post advertisements or promotions for online gambling may be aiding and abetting those activities.)
* Posting political content that would be viewed as endorsing or campaigning for any political candidate. The Zcash Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization and as such are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office”
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct, at the discretion of the moderators.

[](#p-6-etiquettehttpsforumzcashcommunitycomfaqetiquette-3)[Etiquette](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/faq#etiquette)
======================================================================================================================

We strive to keep this forum organized we want everyone to be respectful of others discussions and time. Please do not:

* Start threads that have no or minimal content
* Bump your own threads without something new to add
* Go Off-Topic: Derailing topics to a different subject other than the intent of the threads original post (OP)
* Repetitively post the same content in multiple threads
* Deliberately provoke arguments to cause unrest on the forum
* Brigade: When a user violates the CoC by making posts to cause unrest others who pile on or join the unrest can also be suspended
* Repost topics that have been closed or removed by the system or a moderator
* Spite flag: flagging others only because you have been flagged
* Abuse the flagging system: flagging for no or minor reasons may see your account level reduced

Failure to follow any of the above rules and etiquette are grounds to have a post flagged and your account suspended.

Not-safe-for-work NSFW content (e.g. gifs,memes,images) or links may be removed at moderator discretion, based on judgment calls as to whether the material is offensive or poses other risks to the Zcash Community Forum and its users. NSFW content includes, but is not limited to, sexually explicit material and graphic depictions of violence or gore.

With respect to sexual content in particular, users may not post sexually explicit material, either in images or text. Links to NSFW content that are relevant to Zcash (for example, a service accepting Zcash payments) must include a warning for other users, must not include explicit material in the link preview, and must not be spam.

[](#p-6-moderationhttpsforumzcashcommunitycomfaqmoderation-4)[Moderation](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/faq#moderation)
==========================================================================================================================

Forum moderators have the right and responsibility to hide, edit, or reject posts, comments and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. We follow a three step process as described in our [moderation policy](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-community-forum-moderation-policy/32538)

* Moderators will post publicly the rational of non-personal administrative actions when appropriate and will closely follow the [moderation policy](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-community-forum-moderation-policy/32538)
* Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

Moderators shall:

* Acknowledge that they occupy a position of responsibility and trust in the Zcash community and will uphold the values embodied in this Code of Conduct
* Foster a community that encourages the bigger picture of Zcash aka: building a censorship resistant system where people can safely transact.
* Maintain a welcoming community by taking necessary action towards all community members–including moderators–who choose not to follow these standards.

Note that moderators posts and moderators actions do not necessarily reflect an official position or opinion of the Zcash Foundation. Moderators are free to express their own opinions so long as they adhere to these guidelines. Official Zcash Foundation representatives are identified with the title “Zcash Foundation”.

By adopting these Community Guidelines, moderators commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this community. Moderators who do not follow or enforce the Community Guidelines may be permanently removed from the moderation team.

[](#p-6-reportinghttpsforumzcashcommunitycomfaqreporting-5)[Reporting](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/faq#reporting)

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by flagging the post or comment in question, contacting an individual moderator (such as [@dodger](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/u/dodger)) or by messaging the moderators as a group ([@moderators](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/groups/moderators)).

All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate for the circumstances. Moderators are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
