[](#p-6-zcash-community-code-of-conduct-1)Zcash Community Code of Conduct
=========================================================================

Forum members should strive to be kind and respectful to each other. Ideally, your presence in the community should improve the experience for everyone by promoting teamwork and community participation.

* In the Zcash community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely. We expect that members will work towards collaboration, not conflict.
* New people don’t always know where to find information, so try to be as helpful as you can.
* Respect the privacy of PM (private message) conversations and the wishes of everyone involved.
* Mods will use a yellow color to show when they act in that role within a discussion.

* Brigade: When a user violates the CoC by making posts to cause unrest others who pile on or join the unrest can also be suspended

Failure to follow any of the above rules and etiquette are grounds to have a post flagged and your account suspended.

Not-safe-for-work NSFW content (e.g. gifs,memes,images) or links may be removed at moderator discretion, based on judgment calls as to whether the material is offensive or poses other risks to the Zcash Community Forum and its users.

[](#p-6-moderationhttpsforumzcashcommunitycomfaqmoderation-4)[Moderation](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/faq#moderation)
==========================================================================================================================

Forum moderators have the right and responsibility to hide, edit, or reject posts, comments and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. We follow a three step process as described in our [moderation policy](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-community-forum-moderation-policy/32538)

* Moderators will post publicly the rational of non-personal administrative actions when appropriate and will closely follow the [moderation policy](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-community-forum-moderation-policy/32538)
* Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

Moderators shall:

* Acknowledge that they occupy a position of responsibility and trust in the Zcash community and will uphold the values embodied in this Code of Conduct
* Foster a community that encourages the bigger picture of Zcash aka: building a censorship resistant system where people can safely transact.
* Maintain a welcoming community by taking necessary action towards all community members–including moderators–who choose not to follow these standards.

Note that moderators posts and moderators actions do not necessarily reflect an official position or opinion of the Zcash Foundation. Moderators are free to express their own opinions so long as they adhere to these guidelines. Official Zcash Foundation representatives are identified with the title “Zcash Foundation”.

By adopting these Community Guidelines, moderators commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this community. Moderators who do not follow or enforce the Community Guidelines may be permanently removed from the moderation team.
