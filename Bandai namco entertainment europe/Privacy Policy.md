* the recipients or categories of recipient, including, where applicable, the international organisations, to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries;

This right is limited to processing based on your consent, or on the taking of steps prior to entering into a contract, or on the performance of a contract.  
  
**Your right to withdraw your consent:**  
Where the processing of personal data we carry out is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. We will then stop processing your personal data but this will not affect the operations based on consent before its withdrawal.
