Nitter/Libreddit/Invidious Update
=================================

* * *

Effective 7/2/23, Invidious has been shut down, and effective 8/19/23, Libreddit and Nitter have been shutdown. Due to harsh ratelimits from social media sites, these sites are no longer possible to run because of the long term blocks. Rest assured, riverside.rocks is not getting shut down. I'm working on new projects to add, for instance, [files.riverside.rocks](https://files.riverside.rocks/). Thank you for your support over the years.
