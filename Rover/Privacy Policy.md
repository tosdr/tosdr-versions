We may disclose the personal information we collect with third parties with your consent or as we determine necessary to complete your transactions or provide Services you have requested or authorized. In addition, we disclose each of the categories of personal information described above, to the types of third parties described below for the following business purposes:

* **Pet Service Providers.** We share information about your booking with the applicable Pet Service Provider when you make or accept a booking.
* **Public information.** You may select options available through our Services to publicly display and disclose certain information when you sign up for and participate in the interactive areas of our Services, such as creating a user profile or writing a review (note that if you are a Pet Service Provider, your profile is discoverable to anyone who searches the Site or enters your unique profile URL into their browser).
* **Service Providers.** We share information with vendors, consultants, business partners, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf. For example, companies we’ve hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal information to provide those functions.
* **Legal matters, compliance, and law enforcement.** We may disclose information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, required by, or necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation or legal process. This includes disclosure to tax authorities or other governmental agencies in connection with those agencies’ enforcement of relevant legal obligations.

Our corporate affiliates may also use and disclose this information in accordance with their own privacy statements. Our corporate affiliates are listed [here](https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/articles/202838534#h_01H3J7NXBEABG6B7ZEXQQ0E44S).

We may disclose de-identified information in accordance with applicable law.

### Social Sharing Features

The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of information collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

### Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Third Parties

To the extent permitted by law, we may allow third party analytics and advertising companies to provide analytics services and/or serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These entities may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar technologies to collect information about your use of our websites and third-party websites, including identifiers and device information (such as cookie IDs, device IDs, and IP address), geolocation data, usage data, and inferences based on and associated with that data. To learn more about how these third parties use these technologies and how to manage your preferences, please read our [Cookie Policy](http://www.rover.com/terms/cookies) or see the [Your Choices](#choices) section below. Note that if you opt-out of third-party advertising cookies, you will still see online ads, but they will not be personalized.

Some of the information disclosures to these third parties may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” of personal information as defined under the laws of California and other U.S. states.  Please see the [Your Choices](#choices) and [California and U.S. State Privacy Rights](#ccpa) sections below for more details.

Please note that some of our services also include integrations, references, or links to services provided by third parties whose privacy practices differ from ours. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties, or allow us to share personal data with them, that data is governed by their privacy statements.

Information Security
--------------------

Rover takes reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or through mobile applications is 100% safe. Therefore, although we use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

To help us protect personal information, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.

### Transfer and Location of Information

The information we collect may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. The processing locations are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect information in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps designed to ensure that the information we collect under this statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and applicable law wherever the information is located.

We transfer information from the UK, European Economic Area and Switzerland to the United States and other countries that have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. When we do so, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including executing the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, to help ensure your rights and protections. To learn more about the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, please click [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

Information Retention
---------------------

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful purposes. Because these needs can vary for different information types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the information, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete information, and our legal or contractual obligations.

Your Choices
------------

We provide a variety of ways for you to control the personal information we hold about you, including choices about how we use that information. You can opt in or out of certain uses of your personal information, through our Privacy Management Centre:

Privacy Management Centre

In some jurisdictions, these controls and choices may be enforceable as rights under applicable law. For more information about your specific rights as a resident of California, the UK or the European Union, see [California and U.S. State Privacy Rights & Notices, Do Not Sell or Share](#ccpa), and [UK and European Economic Area Data Protection Rights](#eea).

Please note that this section applies to the Rover Service, and our affiliates may have different procedures for managing your privacy choices. You should refer to their privacy statements for more information.

### Access, portability, correction, and deletion

You may access, update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your account through our website or our mobile application and navigating to the “Profile” or “Account Settings” link.  If you need assistance, you may visit our [Help Centre](https://www.rover.com/sso/zendesk/?return_to=https://support.rover.com/hc/en-us/).

If you wish to permanently delete your account, or cannot access certain information we have using the above methods, you can submit a request under the “Rights” tab of our [Privacy Management Centre](#choices). If you’re unable to access our Privacy Management Centre, you can also contact us using the information in the [Contact Us](#contact) section below. We may decline requests that are prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or other rights of another person, are not required to be honored by applicable law, or where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the information relates.

### Location Information

When you first install or launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application’s collection of this information. We require location information, including your precise geolocation, to use certain features of our Services, so if you do not consent to this collection, you cannot use those features. If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, certain features of our mobile applications will no longer function. You may also stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove our mobile application from your device.

### Emails

You may choose whether you wish to receive marketing emails from Rover by updating your “Notifications” preferences under “Account Settings” in your online Rover profile or through our mobile application.  If you receive marketing emails and you wish to opt-out, you may also do so by clicking “Unsubscribe” in those emails. If you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you Service-related emails, such as those about your account or your ongoing business relationship with us.

### Mobile Push Notifications/Alerts

We may send push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.

### Text Messages

With your consent as required by applicable law, we may send communications containing service information (including technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages), sales, marketing, or advertising messages, by autodialed, prerecorded, or artificial voice calls or SMS, text messages, email, over-the-top messaging platforms (such as WhatsApp), and other electronic means, at any phone number or email address you provide in connection with your account, even if your phone number is on the national or any state’s do-not-call registry. You may opt out of receiving these messages by following the prompt in an individual message or updating your “Notifications” preferences under “Account Settings” in your online Rover profile or through our mobile application (though you may continue to receive messages while we process your request).  However, if you are a Service Provider, certain Pet Care Services that you provide (as detailed in the Rover Service) may require you to receive service-related messages. If you do not want to receive these service-related text messages, then in addition to adjusting your Notifications preferences, you must withdraw from providing such Pet Care Services.

### Data Sales

Some privacy laws define “sale” broadly to include some of the disclosures described in the “How Do We Disclose Your Information” section above. To opt-out from such data “sales” update your preferences at any time by visiting our [Privacy Management Centre](#choices) or enabling the Global Privacy Control settings in a web browser or browser extension as described below.

### Targeted Advertising

You have several options to opt-out from or otherwise control targeted advertising. First, you can use the controls available through our [Privacy Management Centre](#choices) to decline advertising-related cookies. Second, you can use the Global Privacy Control setting in a web browser or browser extension as described below. Third, you can use the opt-out controls offered by the organizations our advertising partners may participate in, which you can access at:

* United States: NAI ([http://optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/)) and DAA ([http://optout.aboutads.info/](http://optout.aboutads.info/))
* Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada ([https://youradchoices.ca/](https://youradchoices.ca/))
* Europe: European Digital Advertising Alliance ([http://www.youronlinechoices.com/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/))

Fourth, you can use the other cookie or mobile ID controls described below.

These choices are specific to the device or browser you are using. If you access our services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

### Browser or Platform Controls

* **Cookie controls**. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated. Visit our [Privacy Management Centre](#choices) or refer to our [Cookie Policy](http://www.rover.com/terms/cookies) for information on how to manage your choices with cookies used on our website.
* **Global Privacy Control**. Some browsers and browser extensions support the “Global Privacy Control” (GPC) or similar controls that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating your choice to opt-out from certain types of data processing, including data sales and/or targeted advertising, as specified by applicable law. When we detect such a signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your choices indicated by a GPC setting or similar control that is recognized by regulation or otherwise widely acknowledged as a valid opt-out preference signal.
* **Do Not Track**. Some browsers include a “Do Not Track” (DNT) setting that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Unlike the GPC described above, there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal; therefore, _our websites do not respond to browser DNT signals_. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the GPC, cookie controls, and advertising controls described above.
* **Mobile advertising ID controls**. iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.

### Email Web Beacons

Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including web beacons, which prevents the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images.

UK and European Economic Area Data Protection Rights
----------------------------------------------------

If the processing of your personal data is subject to UK or EEA data protection law, then in addition to the controls listed above, you have certain rights with respect to that information:

* Access and Rectification. You can request access to or rectification of your personal data.
* Erasure. You can request deletion of your personal data.  Please note, however, that a request to delete your personal data may be restricted if there is a valid legal reason to retain it and may continue to be retained by third parties with whom you communicated through the Rover Service. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about your account for up to a year.
* Consent. If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you can withdraw consent at any time for future processing.

California and U.S. State Privacy Rights & Notices / Do Not Sell or Share
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that the below applies to the Rover Service, and our affiliates may have different procedures for exercising your data subject rights. You should refer to their privacy statements for more information.

### California

If you are a California resident and the processing of your personal information is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “**CCPA**”), you have certain rights with respect to that information:

* Notice at Collection. At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the [categories](#collect) of personal information and sensitive personal information to be collected, the [purposes](#use) for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is [sold or shared](#share) and how long such information is [retained](#retention). You can find those details in this statement by clicking on the above links.
* Right to Know. You have a right to request access to the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you in a readable format. You can also request information about the categories of personal information we collected, the sources of collection, the purposes for collection and sharing of this information, the categories of information we shared, and the categories of third parties with whom we shared this information. Note that we have provided much of this information above in this Privacy Statement. You can see much of the personal information collected about you by logging into your account and viewing your profile. You can also make such a request by using the “Rights” tab of our [Privacy Management Centre](#choices). If you’re unable to access our Privacy Management Centre, you can also contact us using the information in the [Contact Us](#contact) section below. 
* Right to Request Correction or Deletion. You can request that we correct inaccurate personal information and that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. You can correct or remove certain personal information by logging into your account and editing your profile. Requests for deletion can be made using the “Rights” tab of our [Privacy Management Centre](#choices). If you’re unable to access our Privacy Management Centre or if you wish to make other types of requests, you can also contact us using the information in the [Contact Us](#contact) section below.
* Right to Opt-Out of “Sales” or “Sharing” for Targeted Advertising (Do Not Sell or Share). You have a right to opt-out from any sharing of your personal information with third parties to the extent that such sharing is for “cross-context behavioral advertising” or otherwise constitutes a “sale” of that data under the CCPA. Note that the CCPA defines “sell,” “share,” and “personal information” broadly to cover some of our data practices described in this Privacy Statement. In particular, we let advertising and analytics providers collect identifiers (IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs), activity data (browsing, clicks, app usage), device data, and geolocation data through our sites and apps when you use our online services. We may also share information with corporate affiliates, which may be used in accordance with their own privacy statements. We do not “sell” or “share” any other types of personal information. If you wish to opt out, you may do so through the [Privacy Management Centre](#choices) or by enabling in your browser an opt out preference signal that is recognized by regulation or widely acknowledged, such as the Global Privacy Control. If you opt-out using these choices, we will not share or make available such personal information in ways that are considered a “sale” or “sharing” under the CCPA.  However, we will continue to make available to our partners (acting as our service providers) some personal information to help us perform analytics and advertising-related functions. Further, using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” or “shared” personal information or stop all interest-based advertising. For more information, see our [Cookie Policy](http://www.rover.com/terms/cookies).
* Sensitive Personal Information. You have the right to opt-out of or limit certain processing of your sensitive personal information. We do not collect sensitive personal information except as necessary to provide our Services. You may decline to provide such information; however, we may no longer be able to provide our Services. If we use sensitive personal information for purposes other than to provide the Services you request or as otherwise permitted by law, we will inform you and provide you the option to limit such use.
* Right to Non-Discrimination. You will not be discriminated against by Rover for exercising rights set out in the CCPA.
* California “Shine the Light". Under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose personal information to any non-affiliate third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law. To the extent sharing among our affiliates is deemed a disclosure to a “third party,” you can opt-out through our [Privacy Management Centre](#choices). California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by using the [Contact Us](#contact) section below. Businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address or phone number.
* Notice of Financial Incentive. From time to time, we may offer financial incentives to promote the Rover Services, such as discounts, coupons, and special offers when you sign up for our email list or participate in a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. To receive these financial incentives (or opt in), you will be asked to provide personal information, such as through an online form, contest submission, or social media. Participation is optional. You may opt out at any time using the instructions provided when you opt in, or any applicable methods described in the [Your Choices](#choices) section above (for example, by unsubscribing from emails). Each financial incentive related to submission and use of consumer personal information is based on our reasonable but sole determination of the estimated value of such information, which takes into consideration, without limitation, estimates regarding the anticipated revenue generated from such information, the anticipated expenses which might be incurred in the collection, storage, and use of such information in the operation of our business, and other relevant factors related to the estimated value of such information to our business, as permitted under the CCPA. Please note that we may provide additional terms that apply to a particular financial incentive. If applicable, those terms will be presented to you at sign-up or opt-in.

In the past 12 months, we have disclosed, for a business purpose, data from each of the categories of personal information we maintain to our business partners, affiliates, and vendors, as described in the table above.

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.

Further, to provide, correct, or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account.

We do not knowingly collect or sell personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

### Certain Other U.S. States

Certain U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws. If you are a resident of Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, or certain other U.S. states (such as Oregon and Texas, as of July 1, 2024), you may have certain privacy rights detailed below.

* Notice at Collection. At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the [categories](#collect) of personal information and sensitive personal information to be collected, the [purposes](#use) for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is [sold or shared](#share) and how long such information is [retained](#retention). You can find those details in this statement by clicking on the above links.
* Right to Know. You have a right to request access to the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you in readable format. You can also request information about the categories of personal information we collected, the sources of collection, the purposes for collection and sharing of this information, the categories of information we shared, and the categories of third parties with whom we shared this information. Note that we have provided much of this information above in this Privacy Statement. You can see much of the personal information collected about you by logging into your account and viewing your profile. You can also make such a request by using the “Rights” tab of our Privacy Management Centre. If you’re unable to access our [Privacy Management Centre](#choices), you can also contact us using the information in the [Contact Us](#contact) section below. 
* Right to Request Correction or Deletion. You can request that we correct inaccurate personal information and that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. You can correct or remove certain personal information by logging into your account and editing your profile. Requests for deletion can be made using the “Rights” tab of our [Privacy Management Centre](#choices). If you’re unable to access our Privacy Management Centre or if you wish to make other types of requests, you can also contact us using the information in the [Contact Us](#contact) section below.
* Right to Opt-Out of “Sales” or Targeted Advertising (“Sharing”) (Do Not Sell or Share). You have a right to opt-out from the sale  of your personal information and from targeted advertising (which includes “sharing” of your personal information with third parties for “cross-context behavioral advertising”, as defined in applicable laws). Note that these laws may define “sell,” “share,” and “personal information” broadly to cover some of our data practices described in this Privacy Statement. In particular, we let advertising and analytics providers collect identifiers (IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs), activity data (browsing, clicks, app usage), device data, and geolocation data through our sites and apps when you use our online services. We may also share information with corporate affiliates, which may be used in accordance with their own privacy statements. We do not “sell” or “share” any other types of personal information. If you wish to opt-out, you may exercise such a request to opt-out through the [Privacy Management Centre](#choices) or by enabling an opt-out preference signal in your browser that is recognized by regulation or widely acknowledged as valid, such as the Global Privacy Control. If you opt-out using these choices, we will not share or make available such personal information in ways that are considered a “sale” or “sharing or processing” for targeted advertising under applicable laws.  However, we will continue to make available to our partners (acting as our service providers) some personal information to help us perform analytics and advertising-related functions. Further, using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” or “shared” personal information or stop all interest-based advertising. For more information, see our [Cookie Policy](http://www.rover.com/terms/cookies).
* Sensitive Personal Information. For residents of certain states (such as Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, and Texas), we may only process your sensitive personal information if you opt in. In other states (such as Utah), residents have the right to opt-out of or limit certain processing of their sensitive personal information. We do not collect sensitive personal information except as necessary to provide our Services. When you sign up for our Services and/or provide us with sensitive personal information, you opt in to such processing. You may decline to provide such information; however, we may no longer be able to provide our Services. If we use sensitive personal information for purposes other than to provide the Services you request or as otherwise permitted by law, we will inform you and provide you the option to limit such use. 
* Right to Non-Discrimination. You will not be discriminated against by Rover for exercising these rights.

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under applicable laws. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.

Further, to provide, correct, or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account.

We do not knowingly collect or sell personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Controller/Business Designation: We operate as a Controller and a Business under U.S. state privacy laws.
