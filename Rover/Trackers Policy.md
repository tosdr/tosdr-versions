Rover Cookie Policy
===================

Effective: 30 May 2024

This Cookie Policy explains how A Place for Rover, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “**Rover**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or "**our**") collect and process information about you or your device on Rover’s websites (the “**Rover Sites**”) through our use of cookies. For information about our other data privacy practices, please visit our [Privacy Statement](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy). Please note that certain of our affiliates may have separate privacy statements and cookie policies, including GoodPup ([https://goodpup.com/privacy](https://goodpup.com/privacy)), which is owned and operated by PetCareNow, Inc.  This Cookie Policy does not apply to websites, applications, or services that display or link to other privacy statements or cookie policies, unless expressly incorporated by reference in those privacy statements or cookie policies.

Users in the UK or EEA may manage their cookie preferences at any time by visiting Rover’s [Privacy Management Centre](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy/#choices).

What are cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are small text files that can be stored on and accessed from your device when you visit a website. They may include a unique identifier that distinguishes your computer or mobile device from other devices. In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies to track your use of the Rover Sites, such as pixel tags and web beacons.

Web beacons are electronic images that are contained within a website. When your browser opens a webpage that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically hosted by a third-party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to tell us if you open and act on them.

We use the term "**cookies**" in this Cookie Policy to refer generally to all of these technologies that may collect information automatically when you visit the Rover Sites. Cookies are common, and serve many purposes, such as letting you navigate between webpages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience.

Cookies can be “persistent cookies” that remain on your hard drive until they expire or are deleted, or “session cookies” that are deleted from your hard drive when you close your browser. Cookies can also be “first-party cookies” which are set by us, or “third-party cookies” which are set by others.

For further information on cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage or delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?
----------------------------------------------------------------

We, and our analytics and advertising partners, use these technologies in our websites, apps, and online services to collect personal data (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) when you use our services, including personal data about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. This data is used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our websites and apps perform, track your interaction with the site or app, develop inferences, deliver and tailor interest-based advertising, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. We and our partners also share the data we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes. For more information about the third-party analytics and advertising partners that collect personal information on our services, please see the “[How Do We Disclose Your Information](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy/#share)” section of our Privacy Statement.

What kind of cookies are served through the Rover Sites?
--------------------------------------------------------

We use four categories of cookies on the Rover Sites: Strictly Necessary Cookies, Functionality Cookies, Performance/Analytics Cookies, and Advertising Cookies:

Strictly Necessary cookies

Strictly Necessary cookies enable you to navigate the Rover Sites and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Rover Sites. Strictly Necessary cookies don’t gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where else you have visited on the Internet.  This category of cookies cannot be disabled.

Functionality cookies

Functionality cookies enable us to enhance the functionality of the Rover Sites, including by identifying you when you sign in or remembering your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed. We do not share or use information collected by functionality cookies for advertising purposes.

Visit Rover’s [Privacy Management Centre](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy/#choices) to see our third-party partners who allow us to set Functionality cookies on the Rover Sites and, if you are a resident of the EEA or UK, to manage your preferences.

Performance/Analytics cookies

Performance/Analytics cookies help us analyze how you use the Rover Sites.  Performance/Analytics cookies collect and store information such as how you interact with the Rover Sites, errors you encounter when using the Rover Sites, and which pages within the Rover Sites you go to most often. We use the information collected by these cookies to improve the Rover Sites and your user experience.

Visit Rover’s [Privacy Management Centre](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy/#choices) to see our third-party partners who allow us to set Performance/Analytics cookies on the Rover Sites and, if you are a resident of the EEA or UK, to manage your preferences.

Advertising cookies

We and our third-party partners use Advertising cookies to collect personal information (such as the cookies stored on your browser, the advertising identifier on your mobile device, or the IP address of your device) when you visit the Rover Sites to deliver ads to you on third-party websites and applications (including across devices), execute referral programs and brand partnerships, and populate job boards. We also may use Advertising cookies to know when you return to the Rover Sites after visiting these partners’ websites and applications. Mobile analytics and advertising IDs are generated by operating systems for mobile devices (iOS and Android) and can be accessed and used by apps in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. Our apps contain software that enables our third-party analytics and advertising partners to access these mobile IDs.  This information is used to store your preferences and settings, track your interaction with the Rover Sites and third-party sites, develop inferences, deliver and tailor interest-based advertising, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. We and our third-party partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

To see our third-party partners who allow us to set Advertising cookies on the Rover Sites and manage your preferences, visit Rover’s [Privacy Management Centre](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy/#choices).

How can I manage or delete cookies?
-----------------------------------

The following are examples of how you can manage or delete many of the cookies served through the Rover Sites:

* **Privacy Management Centre**. Depending on where you reside, you may manage or opt-out of certain uses of many cookies by visiting our [Privacy Management Centre](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy/#choices).
* **Industry opt-out sites.** You may also opt-out of some uses of Advertising cookies by visiting:
    * [aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices)
    * [networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.aspx choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx%20choices)
    * [https://youradchoices.ca](https://youradchoices.ca/), or
    * [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).
* **Browser settings.** Many web browsers accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually change your browser's settings to reject and/or to remove many cookies. On some browsers, you can choose to let the Rover Sites place cookies, but choose to reject cookies from certain third parties (such as analytics companies or advertising companies). As the precise means by which you may do this will vary from browser to browser, please visit your browser's help or settings menu for more information.
* **Opt out preference signals.** For residents of California, Colorado, or other states and jurisdictions with applicable laws, you may opt-out of certain uses of many cookies by installing a recognizable opt out preference signal in your browser, such as Global Privacy Control ("**GPC**"). Visit your [Privacy Management Centre](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy/#choices) to view or manage your opt-out preferences.
* **Do Not Track.** Some browsers include a “Do Not Track” (DNT) setting that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Unlike the GPC described above, there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal; therefore, _our websites do not respond to browser DNT signals_. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the GPC, cookie controls, and advertising controls described above.

Please note also that if you choose to reject or remove cookies, this may prevent certain features or services of Rover Sites from working properly. Since your cookie opt-out preferences are also stored in a cookie in your website browser, please also note that if you delete all cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choices.

E-mail tracking
---------------

Rover may also use e-mail tracking technologies to monitor the success of e-mail campaigns it operates (for example, recording how many e-mails in a campaign were opened). If you do not want us to track emails we send you, some email services let you change your display to turn off HTML or disable download of images and exercising these rights should effectively disable our email tracking. In addition, you may also unsubscribe from our marketing emails as described in those emails.

Mobile Advertising ID Controls
------------------------------

The iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset device advertising IDs. Please consult the settings on your device to exercise this choice.

Do Not Track
------------

Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals. The Rover Sites do not currently process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above. To learn more about “Do Not Track”, please visit [“](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/)[All About Do Not Track](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/)[”](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

In addition to “Do Not Track”, there are many ways that web browser signals and similar mechanisms can indicate your tracking choices, and we may not be aware of nor honor every mechanism.

California “Do Not Sell or Share My Info”
-----------------------------------------

The California Consumer Protection Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act  (collectively, the “**CCPA**”) requires us to tell you if we have shared your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising or otherwise “sold” your personal information in the past 12 months and how to opt-out of future sales or sharing.

Specifically, in the past 12 months, we have made available to our advertising and analytics providers IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs, whether by enabling them to collect such information through our sites and apps when you use our online services, or by providing such information directly to them. We do not otherwise “sell” personal information.

You can opt-out from any sharing of your personal information with third parties if that sharing constitutes a “sale” of “sharing” of that data under the CCPA.  You can opt out of this type of information sharing by opting out of third-party Advertising cookies through Rover’s [Privacy Management Centre](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy/#choices) as noted above.

Note that although we will not “share” your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising or otherwise “sell” your personal information after you opt out of Advertising cookies, we will continue to share some personal information with our partners (acting as our service providers) to help us perform advertising-related functions such as measuring the effectiveness of our ads, managing how many times you see an ad, managing and reporting on ad performance, providing aggregate statistics and analytics, and/or reducing ad fraud. Further, updating your cookie preferences will not necessarily opt you out of the use of previously collected personal information by these cookies or stop all interest-based advertising. Please note that your cookie preferences are domain-specific and may be browser-specific depending on the method you have used to opt out. This means that if you visit other Rover domains, or replace or upgrade your browser, use another browser (or device), clear your browser’s cookies, or set your browser to refuse third-party cookies, you may need to reset your opt-out preferences.

You can find additional information related to California Privacy Rights in our [Privacy Statement](http://www.rover.com/terms/privacy).

Modifications
-------------

We may change this Cookie Policy at any time, and any such changes will be effective when we post the modified version on the Rover Sites, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
