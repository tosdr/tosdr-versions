Privacy Policy
==============

Privacy is one of the key distinctive feature of SimplePDF - you may have noticed that there is no cookie banner: that's because we don't use any third-party services to track you.

Read on if you are interested in knowing more about what we do to protect your privacy.

What data is not collected
--------------------------

**Everything that can happen on your computer / mobile device will happen on your computer / mobile device.**

* The document(s) you load from your computer / mobile device are loaded locally: the document **does not** get sent to the server
* **The final document is generated locally: the document generation happens on your computer / mobile device**
* The data you enter / fill in **is not sent to the server**: it remains on your computer / mobile device

What data is collected
----------------------

-----------------------------------------

How will we use your data?
--------------------------

* To allow you to log into your account (if you decide to create one)
* Improve the product using the events generated by your usage of SimplePDF: otherwise we would not know what works and what does not

How do we store your data?
--------------------------

The data sent to our server is securily stored in a database located in Europe (Frankfurt) and only accessible by whitelisted IP addresses. There are no passwords stored in the database as the login mechanism relies on email addresses and single-time access tokens only.
