By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize **Tree Social OY** to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

In no event shall **Tree Social OY**, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; any content obtained from the Service; and unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.  
  
We are not obliged to verify the manner in which you or other users use the Website, Platform, Configuration or Services and we shall not be liable for the manner of such usage. We assume that you use the Website Platform and Services legally and ethically and that you have obtained permission, if necessary, to use it on the targeted websites and/or other data sources.  
  
We shall not be liable for the outcomes of activities for which you use our Website, Platform, Configuration or Services. Provided that a third-party service or product is established on the Platform or on any of its functionalities, we shall not be liable for such a service or product, their functioning or manner and consequences of their usage.  
  
We shall not be liable for any of your unlawful actions in connection to the usage of the Website, Platform, Configuration or Services with respect to third parties (e.g. breach of intellectual property rights, rights to the name or company name, unfair competition, breach of terms of websites or applications and programs of third parties).  
  
We shall not guarantee or be liable for the availability of the Website, Platform or Services (or products arising therefrom) or for their performance, reliability or responsiveness or any other performance or time parameters. We shall neither be liable for the functionality or availability of the services of other providers that we mediate to you solely. We shall neither be liable for your breach of service usage terms of such providers.

Your Obligation to Indemnify
----------------------------

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us, our agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and applicable third parties (e.g., all relevant partner(s), licensors, licensees, consultants and contractors) (“Indemnified Person(s)”) harmless from and against any third-party claim, liability, loss, and expense (including damage awards, settlement amounts, and reasonable legal fees), brought against any Indemnified Person(s), arising out of your use of the Website, Platform, Configurations or Services and/or your breach of any of these terms. You acknowledge and agree that each Indemnified Person has the right to assert and enforce its rights under this section directly on its own behalf as a third-party beneficiary.

Disclaimer and Warning
----------------------

Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.  
  
**Tree Social OY** its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.  
  
We may immediately suspend your use of the Website, Platform, Configurations and/or Services if we are contacted by your targeted data extraction source, website, or repository and asked to cease all extraction activity. If such an event occurs, we will not disclose your information without a court order mandating us to do so unless we in our best judgment determine that there would be an adverse consequence if we do not. If, however, we receive a court order demanding the release of your information to a third party, we will comply. If such action becomes necessary, you agree to indemnify and hold us and (as applicable) our parent(s), subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, contractors and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party arising from any complaint, suit, disagreement or other repercussions resulting from your use of the Website, Platform, Configurations or Services.  
  
Should any third party claim its rights against us in connection to your actions, we may immediately eliminate any contents gathered, saved or disseminated by you from servers used by us. In the event of a judicial dispute with a third party related to your actions, you are obliged to provide us with all necessary cooperation in order to resolve such a dispute successfully and you are also obliged to reimburse continuously any purposeful expenses arising to us due to such a dispute. With respect to this, should an obligation arise to reimburse any claim of a third party, you agree to pay us the full scope of the damages.

Governing Law
-------------

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Estonia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  
  
Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.

Changes
-------

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.  
  
By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
