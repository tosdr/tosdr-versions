4\. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
--------------------------

We may disclose some or all of the personal information collected from or about you with any of the following entities and for any of the purposes directly below.

### Our Service Providers

We engage companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., software maintenance services, cloud storage, chatbot providers, order fulfillment, e-mail services, delivery services, database management, analytics, credit referencing, payment processing, and other services) (“Service Providers”). We may disclose some of the information we collect from or about you to our Service Providers, such as information collected automatically from devices you use to connect to our Service. This may include usage and technical information about how users interact with our Service, including activity data such as where you go on our website, how you use different website features, links you click on, and similar information. We may also disclose some of the information that we collect from or about you with other parties in order to process and fulfill your requests for video content offered through our Service, including to provide you with access to localized content and video content recommendations.

These Service Providers have access to your personal information so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are prohibited by us from using or disclosing your information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance, except to the extent required by law. We may permit our Service Providers to use aggregate information which does not identify you or deidentified data for other purposes, consistent with applicable law.

### Advertising Partners

We may provide personal information to third parties, such as advertising partners or other marketing partners who provide services to us.

### Social Networks

Some features of our Service may enable you to post content to social networking services (“SNSs”). If you choose to do this, we will provide information to such SNSs in accordance with your elections. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such SNSs. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such SNSs; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use of any such SNSs. Please refer to the “Social Media Services and Technology Integrations” section for more information on the use of Social Media.

### Affiliates

We may also disclose your personal information to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or Company Affiliates.

### Clients

We may disclose your personal information to our clients in connection with us processing your personal information on their behalf. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletters and promotional communications, Business Insider or EMARKETER may send you content on behalf of their clients and disclose your personal information to such clients for their own marketing purposes.

### Business Partners and Sponsors

We may disclose your personal information to our business partners in connection with offering you co-branded services, selling or distributing our products, or engaging in joint marketing activities. In addition, if you choose to participate in certain of our programs or to receive certain content we make available (e.g., webinar programs), we may disclose your information to participating sponsors, content providers, and related vendors in connection with such programs and content.

### Facilitating Requests

We may disclose your personal information to facilitate your requests such as when you choose to disclose information to a social network about your activities on the Service or participate in a business partner’s program.

### Payment Service

In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments ("Payment Service"). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service. If you purchase one of our services, we and/or Payment Service provider(s) may use payment information to help provide the service you purchased. For example, payment information may be used to retrieve account information for a subscriber, to determine whether a subscriber is eligible for promotions, and to detect abuse of our services. In addition, for your convenience, we or our Payment Service provider(s) may enable your payment information to be accessible between Business Insider and EMARKETER in order to process your transaction more efficiently.

### Vendors and Other Parties

We may disclose personal information to vendors and other parties, for business and commercial purposes, including analytics and advertising technology companies that measure and improve our service, advertising effectiveness and enable other enhancements on our website. Our app does not disclose personal information to vendors and other parties for purposes of targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. Vendors or such other parties may act as our Service Providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information.  For more information on practices related to advertising and analytics, see the “Analytics and Advertising Technology” section below.

### Compliance with Laws, Legal Process, and Authorities

We reserve the right to disclose your information to respond to valid information requests from government authorities and judicial requests, to investigate potential fraud, or where otherwise required by law. We may disclose your personal information where we believe the disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with regulatory or legal requirements, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of ourselves and others and to exercise, establish, or defend our legal rights.

### Business Transfers

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, we may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of our assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

At your direction

We may disclose your personal information at your direction or with your consent.

### The General Public

We may disclose personal information with the general public if you choose to disclose personal information when contributing content to our Service through forums, blogs, social features, or the like.

### Aggregate and/or Deidentifed Data

Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may disclose information, including aggregate data which does not identify you and/or deidentified personal information, to third parties or affiliates for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law. To the extent we process deidentified personal information, as defined under applicable law, we will maintain and use that information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information except as permitted by applicable law.

5\. OTHER PARTIES
-----------------

Our Service contains links to, or content from, other party’s websites and other products and services. The fact that we link to a website or display an advertisement or other party’s content is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with any of those other parties, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.

We do not exercise control over other parties’ websites, products or services, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. These other products and services may place their own cookies or other technologies on your computer or other device, collect data, or solicit information from you while you are exploring their websites, products, or services. Other persons and entities follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the information you submit to them or they collect from you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those other parties.

6\. SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------

### Blogs, Social Media and other Public Forums

We may offer blogs, social media profiles, message boards, bulletin boards, or similar public forums where you and other users of our Service can post content or otherwise communicate. If you post personal information on a public forum, we will assume you intend to make that personal information public. We may use your name to identify you with a posting in a public forum and may use your post on or in connection with our Service (e.g., when using a hashtag associated with Business Insider in a tweet or status update). Any personal information you disclose in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by other persons, including third parties that do not adhere to the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events that may arise from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our online services.

In addition, to the extent you interact with social networks or other services through the Service (such as “liking” or “sharing” our content or otherwise connecting our Service to a social network), information collected and stored by those other parties through your interaction or pages that contain their tracking technologies remains subject to their policies and practices, including whether they disclose information about you to us, the types of information disclosed, and your choices on what is visible to others.

We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any other parties or their services and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

### Analytics and Advertising Technology

Our Service may contain tracking technologies owned and operated by other parties. For example, we use tracking technologies from analytics services, for example Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Service. Our app does not use these technologies for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes.

We may also work with ad networks, advertisers, agencies, and other technology services to place advertisements on our website and/or other websites and services. These parties may set and access cookies and other technologies on your personal computer and/or device and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your personal computer and/or device. As noted above, these website cookies and other technologies are set to, among other things: (a) track your activities across time and services for purposes of measuring conversions or actions you take, associating different devices you use, and serving ads and/or other content targeted to your interests (“**Interest-based Advertising**”); (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. 

We may also use audience matching services (which is a type of Interest-Based Advertising) to reach people (or similar audiences) who have visited our website or are identified in one or more of our databases. For example, we may disclose hashed email addresses to an ad partner to determine if there are common matching factors between our data and their data in order to serve you more personalized ads. 

As discussed above, vendors and ad partners may act as our Service Providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. For further information on your choices regarding these third party tracking technologies, please see the section entitled “Your Advertising Choices” below.

7\. YOUR ADVERTISING CHOICES
----------------------------

### Tracking Technologies Generally

Cookies and location-identifying technologies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your device. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based tracking technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

### Do Not Track

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. We do, however, respond to global privacy preferences when required by law.

### Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies

ou may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and downloading the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser Add-on.

Some of the advertisers and vendors that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt out program for mobile applications. Some of these companies are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. 

Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Business Insider is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

Additionally, we may collaborate with our service providers and identity partners ("Identity Resolution Partners") to deliver targeted advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Services. We and our Identity Resolution Partners may facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use personal information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser. For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, whom may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers also help us with fraud detection and security, enforce our Terms of Service, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and not covered by this Privacy Policy. 

You may have additional rights related to these technologies depending on you

### Communications

If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, please follow any unsubscribe instructions provided in our communications to you, update your user preferences via our subscription management tools on our Service, or contact us as set forth in the section below entitled “Contact Us”, and specify your request. Please note that you cannot opt out of non-promotional e-mails, and we may use your information to contact you with important notifications, such as notices with respect to purchases, safety, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Also, your unsubscribe is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used for that particular subscription and will not affect subsequent subscriptions.

### Other Rights Specific to Your Location

Residents of certain jurisdictions, including, California, Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Oregon, other U.S. states with similar privacy laws, the European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom, have specific rights with respect to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. Please review our location-specific sections below for more information about those rights. 

8\. SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION
-------------------------------

We employ appropriate security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.

If you suspect unauthorized use of personal information that you have provided us – such as your account information or its credentials – you should notify us immediately using the information in the Contact Us section at the end of this Privacy Policy.

We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law. Remember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual, financial or legal requirements.

9\. LOCATION OF DATA
--------------------

Our Services are hosted in and managed from the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. The United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.

To the extent that the Company offers products and services to individuals located in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, or to the extent the Service is deliberately made available to such individuals, please review the section titled “Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe” below for more information about disclosures and privacy rights associated with that activity. 

10\. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
-----------------------------------

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will revise this Privacy Policy to reflect such changes and revise the effective date included at the beginning of this policy. We may provide you additional notice (such as to your e-mail address) if the changes are material. Your use of the Service following any such notice will signify and constitute your assent to and acceptance of such revised Privacy Policy.

Depending on how you interact with us, we may not have processed Personal Information about you for each (or any) of these purposes.

### f. Your Privacy Rights Under Applicable State Law

If you are a resident of California, Virginia, Connecticut, Utah, Colorado, Texas, Oregon, or other U.S. states with similar privacy laws, you may have the following rights with respect to any information about you that constitutes “Personal Information” under California law and “Personal Data” under other state laws, as described below.

We are required by law to verify your identity in connection with any request in order to prevent unauthorized access of your data. Failure to verify your identity may result in your request not being processed. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we deny your request and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.

**Right to Know and Access:** You may request to access the following information we have collected and maintain about you in a portable form:

* The specific pieces of Personal Data and/or Personal Information we collected about you;
    
* The categories of Personal Data and/or Personal Information we collected about you and the categories of sources;
    
* The business or commercial purpose for collecting, disclosing, or selling Personal Data and/or Personal Information about you; and,
    
* The categories of Personal Data and/or Personal Information about you that we sold, shared, or otherwise disclosed and the categories of third parties (or, depending on your state of residence, a list of specific third parties) to whom we sold, shared, or otherwise disclosed that Personal Data and/or Personal Information.
    

Please note that, in some instances, we may decline to honor your request or only honor your request in part, where, for example, we are unable to verify your identity or an exception to this right applies.

**Right to Delete:** You may request that we delete the Personal Data and/or Personal Information we have collected from you. Please note that, in some instances, we may decline to honor your request or only honor your request in part, where, for example, we are unable to verify your identity or an exception to this right applies.

**Opt Out of “Sale”, “Shares”, and Targeted Advertising:** Depending on the state you reside in, website users have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your data and the disclosure of your data for cross-context behavioral advertising/targeted advertising (known as a “share” in California).  We also honor alternative opt out signals, such as the GPC. We process opt out preference signals in a frictionless manner. Since our mobile application requires a paid subscription after accessing three complementary articles, our mobile application does not sell, share, or process Personal Information and/or Personal Data for targeted advertising purposes. Please note that we do not sell Personal Information for monetary consideration. 

**Right to Correction:** You have a right to request the correction of inaccurate Personal Data and/or Personal Information that we may have on file about you. Please note that, in some instances, we may decline to honor your request or only honor your request in part, where, for example, we are unable to verify your identity or an exception to this right applies.

**Right to Non-Discrimination:** You have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your above-listed rights under Applicable Laws.

**Right to Appeal:** Depending on your state of residence, you may have the right to request an appeal our action in response to a consumer request.

13\. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR DATA SUBJECTS IN EUROPE AND UNITED KINGDOM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Controller

This section applies to any individuals located within the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any jurisdiction to which similar privacy laws apply, from whom we may have collected personal data from any source, including through your use of our Services. We provide this Notice to comply with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Act (“GDPR”), the UK GDPR, and related laws, regulations, and guidance from the European Union and/or its member states. Any capitalized term used and not otherwise defined below has the meaning assigned to it in our Privacy Policy.

For the purposes of this Notice, “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

EU and UK data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). Both Business Insider and EMARKETER may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your personal data, depending on the circumstances. We generally act as data controller with respect to information you provide through the Service. Sometimes we operate as a data processor on behalf of a client, a separate legal entity, which is the data controller. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletters and promotional communications, we may send you content on behalf of our clients and share your personal data with our clients for their own marketing purposes. Please visit the applicable client’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. Any questions that you may have relating to such personal data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the client as the data controller, not to Business Insider or EMARKETER.

### Basis for Processing Your Personal Data

We rely on one or more legal bases to process your personal data under applicable law. We may process personal data (i) as necessary to perform our contractual obligations to you, including, but not limited to, those obligations in our terms of use; (ii) as necessary to pursue our legitimate interests as further detailed below; (iii) as necessary for our compliance with our legal obligations such as a request or order from courts, law enforcement or other government authorities; and/or (iv) with your consent, including to send you marketing email messages and other information that may be of interest to you, which you may withdraw at any time.

### Legitimate business interests

We may collect, process, and maintain personal data to pursue the legitimate business interests outlined below. To determine these legitimate interests, we balance our legitimate interests against the legitimate interests and rights of you and others and only process personal data in accordance with those interests where they are not overridden by your data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

While our legitimate interests are most extensively detailed in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy, they generally include:

**Provide, improve, and develop our Service**, including to deliver your requested Services, send you messages and provide user support, customize the Services to better fit your needs as a user, develop new Services, and perform internal analytics and research and development. This also includes sharing personal data with our trusted service providers that provide services on our behalf.

**Protect you and others and to create and maintain a trusted environment**, such as to comply with our legal obligations, to ensure compliance our agreements with you and other third parties, to ensure safe, secure, and reliable Services, and to detect and prevent wrongdoing and crime, assure compliance with our policies, and protect and defend our rights, interests, and property. In connection with the activities above, we may conduct internal research and profiling based on your interactions on various Sites, content you submit to the Sites, and information obtained from third parties.

**Provide, personalize, measure and improve our marketing**, including to send you promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you with your consent. We may also use personal data to understand our user base and the effectiveness of our marketing. This processing is done pursuant to our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer products or services that may be of interest to you.

### Your Privacy Rights

If you are a data subject in a jurisdiction identified in this section, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Service. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Service. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.

To exercise any of these rights, please click [here](https://my.datasubject.com/169pxRTHL4HFV2CIm/23040) and follow the instructions, or contact us at [privacy@insider-inc.com](mailto:privacy@insider-inc.com?) and specify which right you intend to exercise. For EMARKETER, please email your request at [privacy@emarketer.com](mailto:privacy@emarketer.com?). We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Further, if we are processing your information on behalf of one of our clients, we will refer you to that client, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.

If you have any issues with our compliance or you believe that we have not complied with our obligations under this Privacy Policy or European or UK law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU Data Protection Authority, such as the UK Information Commissioner's Office. You can view the contact information for your data protection authority [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

### Data Retention

We will only retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for. We will retain and use your information as necessary to satisfy any legal, accounting or reporting requirements, to resolve disputes or to enforce our agreements and rights. In line with this Privacy Policy, we will either securely delete or anonymize your data so that it cannot be linked back to you.

### Data Transfer

We will not transfer personal data originating from the EU to third parties located outside of the EU without ensuring adequate protection under European or UK law. Where transfer is to a party located in a third country not recognized by the EU Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection, we will take appropriate steps to transfer the personal data subject to adequate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses as well as other appropriate measures and safeguards.
