THE CONVERSION PROS PRIVACY POLICY
==================================

This Privacy Policy went into effective as of November 2015. This policy was last updated October 3, 2023.

The Conversion Pros, Inc. provides a cutting edge online marketing system for business owners and entrepreneurs to establish an online presence for their business, find their audience, build relationships with their clients and market their products to their clients. Our marketing system provides our Clients with email broadcasting, Auto Responders, Text/SMS, capture pages, sales funnels, and many other tools to choose from. As prospects respond back to or input their information into one of the marketing tools our Clients use within our system, data is collected on the prospects. Should the prospect become a direct Client of The Conversion Pros, Inc., more information is collected at the time of sign up.

The Conversion Pros, Inc. plays multiple roles when it comes to our relationship with the data collected:

* When we provide our services to our Direct Clients, we are gathering personal information on them and acting as the Data Controller. In the Data Controller scenario, The Conversion Pros, Inc. makes the changes to the data per the request of our Direct Client.

* When our Client uses our services to contact and gather information from their own clients (Data Subjects), the data collected in our system is controlled by our Client, therefore, we are acting as the Data Processor. In the Data Processor role, our Clients send us requests for the information changes on behalf of the Data Subjects. Therefore, the Data Subjects need to contact our Clients directly for any data changes needed.

* The Conversion Pros, Inc. has an Affiliate program, that compensates our Clients for referring other Clients to use our services. The referred Client becomes a direct Client of The Conversion Pros, Inc. In this scenario, The Conversion Pros, Inc. is acting as the Data Controller and makes changes to the data collected from the referred Client, per the request made directly from the referred Client.

1.  Our Commitment to Privacy.
