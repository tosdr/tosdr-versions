These Terms of Service, which include by reference CallApp’s [Privacy Policy](https://callapp.com/privacy) (collectively, “**Terms**“) govern your use of CallApp’s software in executable code form only, any documentation provided therewith, and any modified, updated, or enhanced versions of such items that CallApp may provide to you pursuant to these Terms (“**Software**”), along with CallApp’s websites, web services, APIs or other online and offline services (together with the Software, the “**Service**”), irrespective of release version. These Terms constitute a legal agreement between you, either an individual or a single entity (“**you**” or “**user**“) and CallApp Software Ltd. (“**CallApp**”, “**we**” or “**us**”).

If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of an organization, you hereby warrant that you have the authority to do so.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DOWNLOAD, CONNECT TO, ACCESS, ACTIVATE OR USE THE SERVICE AND ARE OBLIGED TO UNINSTALL OR ERASE THE SOFTWARE FROM ALL YOUR DEVICES.

**The Service is not designed or intended for children under the age of eighteen (18), unless a younger age threshold has been adopted by your country (the “Eligible Age”).** We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage to verify that minors under the Eligible Age are not using the Service. In the event that we learn that a child under the Eligible Age uses the Service, we will prohibit such person from accessing the Service and we will terminate the relevant account.
