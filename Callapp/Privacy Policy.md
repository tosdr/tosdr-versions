The companies may use that data to serve you more relevant ads on the Service or on other websites. Under the CCPA, sharing data like this may be considered a “sale” of personal information.  
To exercise your right to opt-out of such sale, please click [here](https://callapp.com/ccpa-optout). Except for this kind of sharing, CallApp has not sold your personal information; however, please review the disclosure below regarding how we may sell your Collected Information in the future.

We will suspend the processing of your Collected Information. Please note that this may affect your ability to use the Service, or in some cases, terminate the Service completely.

* The right to **object** to any processing of your Collected Information based on our legitimate interest.
