Electronic Transactions and Disclosures: Because Fundrise operates only on the Internet, it is

necessary for you to consent to transact business with us online and electronically. As part of doing

business with us and our affiliates (“Our Affiliates”), therefore, we also need you to consent to our giving

you certain disclosures electronically, either via our Site or to the email address you provide to us. By

agreeing to the Terms of Service, you agree to receive electronically all documents, communications,

notices, contracts, and agreements (including any IRS Forms, including Form 1099 and Schedule K-1)

arising from or relating to your use of the Site and Service, including any notes you have purchased, your

use of this Service, and the servicing of any notes you have purchased as either an investor of Fundrise

(each, a “Disclosure”), from us, whether we are acting in the capacity as trustee or otherwise, or Our

Affiliates. An IRS Form refers to any Form 1099, Schedule K-1 or other Form, Schedule or information

statement, including corrections of such documents, required to be provided pursuant to U.S. Internal

Revenue Service rules and regulations and that may be provided electronically (each, an “IRS Form”),

provided that you consent to such electronic delivery, as more fully described in the subscription

document(s) applicable to you.



Electronic Communications: Any Disclosures will be provided to you electronically through

fundrise.com either on our Site or via electronic mail to the verified email address you provided. If you

require paper copies of such Disclosures, you may write to us at the mailing address provided below and

a paper copy will be sent to you at a cost of up to $5.00. A request for a paper copy of any Disclosure will

not be considered a withdrawal of your consent to receive Disclosures electronically. Any IRS Forms

provided electronically will remain accessible for twelve months following the end of the tax year to which

the IRS Forms relate, or six months after the date of issuance of the IRS Forms, whichever is later; after

that time the IRS Forms may no longer be accessible electronically. We may discontinue electronic

provision of Disclosures at any time in our sole discretion, in which case we will provide you with paper

copies.

4



Scope of Consent: Your consent to receive Disclosures and transact business electronically,

and our agreement to do so, applies to any transactions to which such Disclosures relate, whether

between you and Fundrise or between you and Our Affiliates. Your consent will remain in effect for so

long as you are a User and, if you are no longer a User, will continue until such a time as all Disclosures

relevant to transactions that occurred while you were a User have been made, subject to any special

rules regarding consent to electronic delivery of IRS Forms, as more fully described in the [subscription

document(s) applicable to you.



Consenting to Do Business Electronically: Before you decide to do business electronically

with Fundrise or Our Affiliates, you should consider whether you have the required hardware and

software capabilities described below.



Hardware and Software Requirements: In order to access and retain Disclosures electronically,

you must satisfy the following computer hardware and software requirements: access to the Internet; an

email account and related software capable of receiving email through the Internet; supported Web

browsing software (three most recent versions of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Firefox, Internet

Explorer version 11 or higher, or Safari version 10 or higher); and hardware capable of running this

software.



TCPA Consent: You expressly consent to receiving calls and messages, including auto-dialed

and pre-recorded message calls, and SMS messages (including text messages) from us, our affiliates,

provided or may provide in the future (including any cellular telephone numbers). Your cellular or mobile

telephone provider will charge you according to the type of plan you carry.



Additional Mobile Technology Requirements: If you are accessing our Site and the

Disclosures electronically via a mobile device (such as a smart phone, tablet, and the like), in addition to

the above requirements you must make sure that you have software on your mobile device that allows

you to print and save the Disclosures presented to you during the application process. These applications

can be found for most mobile devices in the device’s respective “app store”. If you do not have these

capabilities on your mobile device, please access our Site through a device that provides these

capabilities.



Withdrawing Consent: You may not withdraw such consent as long as you have outstanding

any investments made through the Site; provided, however, that you may withdraw consent to receive

electronic delivery of IRS Forms, as more fully described in the Subscription document(s) applicable to

you. If you have no outstanding investments made through the Site and wish to withdraw consent to

doing business electronically, we will terminate your registered user account with us.

Securities Offering Matters



General. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Service, in no event shall

anything in these Terms of Service be deemed to be a waiver, and we will not assert there has been a

waiver, that would not be permissible under Section 14 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the

“Securities Act”), Section 29(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)

5



or any other applicable provision of federal and state securities laws.



The securities offered on the Site have not been registered under the Securities Act, in reliance

on the exemptive provisions of (i) Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D

promulgated thereunder (“Regulation D” or “private placements”), and/or (ii) Regulation A promulgated

under the Securities Act (“Regulation A”). Securities sold through private placements are restricted and

not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor

any state securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved, passed upon or endorsed the

merits of any offering on this Site.



Persons who are resident outside of the United States are not allowed access to investment

opportunities on the Site. Our services (and certain pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual

investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein may not be used by

any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable

laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where Fundrise is not authorized to provide

such information or services.



Investment overviews on the Site contain summaries of the purpose and principal business terms

of the investment opportunities. Such summaries are intended for informational purposes only and do not

purport to be complete, and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed discussions

contained in the investor document package relating to such investment opportunity, the most current

version of each such document package may be found at fundrise.com/oc. The information contained in

the Site has been prepared by Fundrise without reference to any particular user’s investment

requirements or financial situation, and potential investors are encouraged to consult with professional

tax, legal and financial advisors before making any investment.



Eligibility.



Private Placements. Only "accredited investors" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D are

authorized to access such services and web pages relating to offerings conducted under Regulation D

(such persons being "Accredited Investors"). In general, to qualify as an Accredited Investor, individuals

must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding their primary residence), or gross income for

each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with their spouse) with the expectation of

a similarly qualifying income during the current year.



Regulation A. "Tier II" Investment opportunities registered pursuant to Regulation A of the

Securities Act, including real estate investment trusts and other funds sponsored by one of Our Affiliates,

are offered only to "Qualified Purchasers" as defined in Regulation A. "Qualified Purchasers" include: (i)

Accredited Investors and (ii) all other investors so long as their investment in one of our offerings does not

represent more than 10% of the greater of their annual income or net worth (for natural persons), or 10%

of the greater of annual revenue or net assets at fiscal year-end (for non-natural persons).



Covered Persons. You may not become a beneficial owner of 20% or more of any issuer’s

outstanding voting equity securities (an “Issuer Covered Person”) without becoming subject to certain

“bad actor” disqualifying events described in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D or Rule 262(a) of Regulation A

(a “Disqualifying Event”). You represent that you are not subject to a Disqualifying Event and that you will

promptly notify Fundrise in writing should any Disqualifying Events be applicable to you. Fundrise is not

liable or responsible for making Rule 506(e) under Regulation D or Rule 262(e) disclosures under

Regulation A, nor for determining whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualifying Event.



Documentation. You may be required to provide supporting documents to issuers that provide

proof that you are an Accredited Investor or Qualified Purchaser and as to your status with respect to

being an Issuer Covered Person. Such proof will require your completion of a subscription agreement and

may require completion of a questionnaire and satisfactory background information screening. Your

failure to provide any information and documentation requested to confirm your status will be cause for

Fundrise to immediately discontinue your use of the Service by preventing your access to the Website

6



and the Service.



Investment Adviser Matters



Fundrise Advisors, LLC ("Fundrise Advisors"), an affiliate of Fundrise, is registered with the Securities and

Exchange Commission as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Financial

advisory services are only provided to investors who become Fundrise Advisors Clients ("Clients")

pursuant to a written Client Agreement, which investors are urged to read, along with Part 2 of Fundrise

Advisors’ Form ADV, and carefully consider in determining whether such agreement is suitable for their

individual facts and circumstances.



PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS, AND ANY EXPECTED

RETURNS OR HYPOTHETICAL PROJECTIONS MAY NOT REFLECT ACTUAL FUTURE

PERFORMANCE. FURTHERMORE, PAST RETURNS MAY REFLECT THE PERFORMANCE OF

ASSETS FOR A FINITE TIME, OR DURING A PERIOD OF EXTREME MARKET ACTIVITY. ALL

INVESTMENTS INVOLVE RISK AND MAY RESULT IN PARTIAL OR TOTAL LOSS. There can be no

assurance that an investment mix or any projected or actual performance shown on the Site will lead to

the expected results shown or perform in any predictable manner. It should not be assumed that investors

will experience returns in the future, if any, comparable to those shown or that any or all investors on the

Site experienced such returns.



Securities Law Disclosures



You are urged to review our full disclosure and offering circulars with respect to the securities offerings on

the Site as well as the services provided by Fundrise Advisors.



Third Party Distribution Channels



Fundrise offers software applications that may be made available through the Apple App Store, Android

Marketplace or other distribution channels (“Distribution Channels”). If you obtain such software through a

if any; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty

obligation whatsoever with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software, or any other claims, losses,

liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty,

which will be Fundrise’s sole responsibility, to the extent it cannot be disclaimed under applicable

law.

of you or any third party relating to the Apple-Enabled Software or your possession and/or use of

for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property

infringement claim.

Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist

supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or

deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Service against you with respect to the

Apple-Enabled Software as a third party beneficiary thereof.



The following terms apply to you if you download the App for use on an Android product: The Google

Play marketplace is owned and operated by Google Inc. Your use of Google Play is governed by a legal

agreement between you and Google Inc. consisting of the Google Terms of Service (currently found at

https://play.google.com/intl/en-US_us/about/play-terms.html). Google Play is a “Service” as described in

the Google Terms of Service. If there is any conflict between the Google Play Terms of Service and the

Google Terms of Service, the Google Play Terms of Service shall prevail.

Trademarks displayed on the Service, without our prior written permission in each instance. All goodwill

generated from the use of Fundrise Trademarks will inure to our exclusive benefit.



Third Party Material: Under no circumstances will Fundrise be liable in any way for any content

out of or relating to your use of the Service, any User Content, your connection to the Service, your

violation of these Terms of Service or your violation of any rights of another. Notwithstanding the

foregoing, you will have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnitee from or against any

liability, losses, damages or expenses incurred as a result of any action or inaction of such Indemnitee. If

you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general

release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the

time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the

debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT

AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.



a. Agreement to Arbitrate



This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the

“Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise

between you and Fundrise, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any

alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions

between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in

accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in

small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from

bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law

allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you

and Fundrise are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will

be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the

interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.



b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief



YOU AND FUNDRISE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER

ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY

PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND

FUNDRISE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE

THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY

FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE

ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY

RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE

EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL

CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD

PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE

ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.



c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution



Fundrise is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns

can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at

support@fundrise.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must

first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Fundrise

should be sent to 1601 Connecticut Avenue NW, 3rd Floor, Washington, DC 20009 (“Notice Address”).

The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific

relief sought. If Fundrise and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice

is received, you or Fundrise may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount

of any settlement offer made by Fundrise or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the

arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Fundrise is entitled.



d. Arbitration Procedures



Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration

Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively,

the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its

website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be

found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If there is any

inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the

applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the

11



application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair

arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All

issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope,

enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually

simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the

same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms

of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned

by a court only for very limited reasons.



Unless Fundrise and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Washington, DC. If

the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for

$10,000 or less, Fundrise agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on

the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person

hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be

determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the

arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and

conclusions on which the award is based.



e. Costs of Arbitration



Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be

governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the

relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Fundrise will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief

sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically

unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason

that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Fundrise will pay your portion

of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive

as compared to the costs of litigation, Fundrise will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator

deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees

will be governed by the AAA Rules.



f. Confidentiality



All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be

strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.



g. Severability



If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the

subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”

above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or

provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or

unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a

court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class

and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety

of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or

unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of

Service will continue to apply.



h. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement



Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Fundrise agrees that if it makes

any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you

are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Fundrise written notice within thirty

(30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change,

you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this

12



Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any

subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).



i. Compliance with Federal Securities Laws



BY AGREEING TO BE SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION PROVISION CONTAINED IN THIS

AGREEMENT, INVESTORS WILL NOT BE DEEMED TO WAIVE FUNDRISE’S COMPLIANCE WITH

THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED

THEREUNDER.



Termination

You agree that Fundrise, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part

thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason,

including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Fundrise believes that you have violated or acted

inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or

illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate

law enforcement authorities. Fundrise may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing

the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to

the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and

acknowledge and agree that Fundrise may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related

information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further,

you agree that Fundrise will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the

Service.



General

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Fundrise and govern your use

of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Fundrise with respect to the Service.

You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third

party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the

laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes

or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Fundrise agree to submit to the personal

and exclusive jurisdiction of (i) the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia

(Alexandria division), or (ii) solely to the extent there is no applicable federal jurisdiction over such dispute

or matter, in the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, Virginia. The failure of Fundrise to exercise or enforce

any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If

any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the

parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as

reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and

effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising

out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after

such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any

notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or

relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business

documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this

Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Fundrise, but Fundrise may assign or transfer this

Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are

for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email

or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or

other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
