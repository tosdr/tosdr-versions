Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.



The purchasing process includes these steps:



Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.

After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order

by submitting it.



Order submission



When the User submits an order, the following applies:



Each order submitted constitutes an offer to purchase. The submission of the order creates for the User

the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order

page.

In case the purchased Product requires an action from the User, such as the provision of personal

information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the

User to cooperate accordingly.

Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt. Unless stated otherwise in the relevant

communication, the aforementioned receipt merely indicates reception of the order and does not

constitute acceptance of the order.



Order acceptance



Unless the order receipt expressly includes the acceptance of the order, in which case the contract is

therefore then entered into, the purchase contract is entered into at the moment the User receives the

communication of order acceptance.

Subject to availability and to the Owner’s discretion, the order shall be accepted without undue delay.

If the order is not accepted, the Owner shall issue a refund.



The rejection of an order shall not entitle the User to bring any claim against the Owner, including

compensation for damages.



All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by

the User for such purposes.



Prices



Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and

costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.



Prices on Blue Ocean Law Group are displayed:



including all applicable fees, taxes and costs.

The Owner may offer discounts or provide special offers for the purchase of Products. Any such offer or

discount shall always be subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the

corresponding section of Blue Ocean Law Group.



Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner’s sole discretion.



Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future.

offer or discount is limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as indicated in

the Owner’s location details in this document, unless otherwise specified.



Coupons

Offers or discounts can be based on Coupons.



If breach of the conditions applicable to Coupons occurs, the Owner can legitimately refuse to fulfill its

contractual obligations and expressly reserves the right to take appropriate legal action to protect its rights

and interests.



Notwithstanding the provisions below, any additional or diverging rules applicable to using the Coupon

displayed in the corresponding information page or on the Coupon itself shall always prevail.



Unless otherwise stated, these rules apply to the use of Coupons:



Each Coupon is only valid when used in the manner and within the timeframe specified on the website

and/or the Coupon;

A Coupon may only be applied, in its entirety, at the actual time of purchase – partial use is not

permitted;

Unless otherwise stated, single-use Coupons may only be used once per purchase and therefore may

only be applied a single time even in cases involving installment-based purchases;

A Coupon cannot be applied cumulatively;

The Coupon must be redeemed exclusively within the time specified in the offer. After this period, the

Coupon will automatically expire, precluding any possibility for the User to claim the relevant rights,

including cash-out;

The User is not entitled to any credit/refund/compensation if there is a difference between the value of

the Coupon and the redeemed value;

The Coupon is intended solely for non–commercial use. Any reproduction, counterfeiting and

commercial trade of the Coupon is strictly forbidden, along with any illegal activity related to the

purchase and/or use of the Coupon.



Methods of payment



Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.



Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related

information can be found in the dedicated section of Blue Ocean Law Group.



Payment methods marked accordingly are managed directly by the Owner. In this case, the Owner collects

and stores the data necessary for the processing of payments and for fulfilling any legal obligation related to

them. The User may read the privacy policy of Blue Ocean Law Group to learn more about the data

processing and Users’ rights regarding their data.



Other payment methods – if any – are independently provided by third-party services. In such cases Blue

Ocean Law Group collects no payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a

notification from the relevant third-party provider once the payment has been successfully completed.



If payment through the available methods fail, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfill the purchase

order. If a payment fails or is refused, the Owner reserves the right to claim any related expenses or

damages from the User.



Payment of price in installments



The payment of the purchase price may be settled in two or more installments, within the deadlines specified

on Blue Ocean Law Group or otherwise communicated by the Owner.

immediately due and payable.

identification code linked to the Users’ PayPal account. This will authorize Blue Ocean Law Group to

settings offered by PayPal.

limited to lawyer's fees and costs — made by any third party due to or in relation with any culpable violation

of these Terms, third-party rights or statutory provisions connected to the use of the Service by the User or

its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees to the extent allowed by

applicable law.



Limitation of liability

Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without prejudice to applicable law, Users shall have no right to claim

damages against the Owner (or any natural or legal person acting on its behalf).



This does not apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages resulting from the breach of

material contractual obligations such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the

contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as long as Blue Ocean Law Group has

been appropriately and correctly used by the User.



Unless damages have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or they affect life, health or physical

integrity, the Owner shall only be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at the moment the

contract was entered into.



In particular, within the limits stated above, the Owner shall not be liable for:



any losses that are not the direct consequence of a breach of the Terms by the Owner;



any loss of business opportunities and any other loss, even indirect, that may be incurred by the User

(such as, but not limited to, trading losses, loss of revenue, income, profits or anticipated savings, loss

of contracts or business relationships, loss of reputation or goodwill, etc.);



damages or losses resulting from interruptions or malfunctions of Blue Ocean Law Group due to acts of

force majeure, or unforeseen and unforeseeable events and, in any case, independent of the will and

beyond the control of the Owner, such as, but not limited to, failures or disruptions of telephone or

electrical lines, the Internet and / or other means of transmission, unavailability of websites, strikes,

natural disasters, viruses and cyber attacks, interruptions in the delivery of products, third-party

services or applications;



any damage, prejudice or loss occurring due to viruses or other malware contained in or connected to

files available for download from the internet or via Blue Ocean Law Group. Users are responsible for

implementing sufficient security measures – such as anti-viruses and firewalls to prevent any such

infection or attack and for securing backup copies of all data or information exchanged via or uploaded

to Blue Ocean Law Group.



Notwithstanding the above, the following limitation applies to all Users not qualifying as Consumers:



In any event of liability, the compensation may not exceed the total payments that have been, will be or

would be received by the Owner from the User based on the contract over a period of 12 months, or the

period of the duration of the Agreement, if shorter.



Australian Users



Limitation of liability



Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition, warranty, right or remedy

which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any similar State and

Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified (non-excludable right). To the

fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable

right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms of Use, is limited, at the Owner’s sole

discretion, to the re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied

again.



US Users



Disclaimer of Warranties



Blue Ocean Law Group is provided strictly on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Use of the

Service is at Users’ own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Owner

expressly disclaims all conditions, representations, and warranties — whether express, implied,

statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability,

fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights. No advice or

information, whether oral or written, obtained by the User from the Owner or through the

Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.



Without limiting the foregoing, the Owner, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, officers,

directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees do not warrant that the

content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Service will meet Users’ requirements; that the

Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any

defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful

components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is

downloaded at Users' own risk and Users shall be solely responsible for any damage to Users’

computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or Users’ use

of the Service.



The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or

service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or

service, and the Owner shall not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between

Users and third-party providers of products or services.



The Service may become inaccessible or it may not function properly with Users’ web browser,

mobile device, and/or operating system. The owner cannot be held liable for any perceived or

actual damages arising from Service content, operation, or use of this Service.



Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions, do not allow the exclusion and limitations of

certain implied warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to Users. This Agreement gives

Users specific legal rights, and Users may also have other rights which vary from state to state.

The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement shall not apply to the extent prohibited by

applicable law.



Limitations of liability



To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner, and its

subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and

employees be liable for:



any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including

without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses,

arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service; and

any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access

or use of the Service or User account or the information contained therein;

any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;

personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from User access

to or use of the Service;

any unauthorized access to or use of the Owner’s secure servers and/or any and all personal

information stored therein;

any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service;

any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the

Service;

any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the

use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the

Service; and/or

the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any User or third party. In no event shall the

Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners,

suppliers and employees be liable for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations,

damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount paid by User to the Owner

hereunder in the preceding 12 months, or the period of duration of this agreement between

the Owner and User, whichever is shorter.



This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the

applicable jurisdiction whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict

liability, or any other basis, even if the User has been advised of the possibility of such damage.



Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential

damages, therefore the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to the User. The terms

give User specific legal rights, and User may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction

to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under the terms shall not

apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.



Indemnification



The User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates,

officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees harmless from and

against any and all claims or demands, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt,

and expenses, including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses, arising from



User’s use of and access to the Service, including any data or content transmitted or

received by User;

User’s violation of these terms, including, but not limited to, User’s breach of any of the

representations and warranties set forth in these terms;

User’s violation of any third-party rights, including, but not limited to, any right of privacy

or intellectual property rights;

User’s violation of any statutory law, rule, or regulation;

any content that is submitted from User’s account, including third party access with User’s

unique username, password or other security measure, if applicable, including, but not

limited to, misleading, false, or inaccurate information;

User’s wilful misconduct; or

statutory provision by User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders,

partners, suppliers and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.

Common provisions



No Waiver



The Owner’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any

such right or provision. No waiver shall be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any

other term.



Service interruption



To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right to interrupt the Service for

maintenance, system updates or any other changes, informing the Users appropriately.



Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or discontinue the Service altogether. If the

Service is discontinued, the Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw Personal Data or

information and will respect Users' rights relating to continued product use and/or compensation, as

provided for by applicable law.



Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside the Owner’s reasonable control, such

as “force majeure” events (infrastructural breakdowns or blackouts etc.).



Service reselling



Users may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of Blue Ocean Law Group and of

its Service without the Owner’s express prior written permission, granted either directly or through a

legitimate reselling programme.



Privacy policy



For information about the use of their personal data, Users must refer to the privacy policy of Blue Ocean

Law Group which is hereby declared to be part of these Terms.



Intellectual property rights



Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any intellectual property rights, such as

copyrights, trademark rights, patent rights and design rights related to Blue Ocean Law Group are the

exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws

or international treaties relating to intellectual property.



All trademarks — nominal or figurative — and all other marks, trade names, service marks, word marks,

illustrations, images, or logos appearing in connection with Blue Ocean Law Group are, and remain, the

exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws

or international treaties related to intellectual property.



Changes to these Terms



The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms at any time. In such cases, the

Owner will appropriately inform the User of these changes.



Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User from the date communicated to Users onwards.



The continued use of the Service will signify the User’s acceptance of the revised Terms. If Users

do not wish to be bound by the changes, they must stop using the Service and may terminate the

Agreement.



The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to the User's acceptance. The User can

obtain any previous version from the Owner.

If legally required, the Owner will notify Users in advance of when the modified Terms will take effect.



Exception for Consumers in France



Regardless of the above, any change of these Terms shall be communicated in writing no later than one

month prior to becoming effective. Should Consumers in France not accept the modified Terms, they shall

have the right to terminate the Agreement without any penalty nor right to claim compensation up to four

months following the day on which the modified Terms have become effective.



Assignment of contract



The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by novation, or subcontract any or all rights or

obligations under these Terms, taking the User’s legitimate interests into account. Provisions regarding

changes of these Terms will apply accordingly.



Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under these Terms in any way, without the written

permission of the Owner.



Contacts



All communications relating to the use of Blue Ocean Law Group must be sent using the contact information

stated in this document.



Severability



Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law,

the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions,

which shall remain in full force and effect.



US Users



Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent

reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These Terms

constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and

supersede all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties

with respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.



EU Users



Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do

their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting

the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.

In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable

statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.



Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these

Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement,

or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the

provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an

unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.



Authoritative version of these Terms



These Terms are drawn up and revised in English (UK). Other language versions of these Terms are provided

for information purposes only. In the event of any inconsistency between different linguistic versions, the

original version shall always prevail.



Governing law



These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is based, as disclosed in the relevant

section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.



Prevalence of national law



However, regardless of the above, if the law of the country that the User is located in provides for higher

applicable consumer protection standards, such higher standards shall prevail.

Venue of jurisdiction



The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting from or connected to these Terms lies with

the courts of the place where the Owner is based, as displayed in the relevant section of this document.



Exception for Consumers in Europe



The above does not apply to any Users that qualify as European Consumers, nor to Consumers based in the

United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway or Iceland.



UK Consumers



Consumers based in England and Wales may bring legal proceedings in connection with these Terms in the

English and Welsh courts. Consumers based in Scotland may bring legal proceedings in connection with

these Terms in either the Scottish or the English courts. Consumers based in Northern Ireland may bring

legal proceedings in connection with these Terms in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.



US Users



Each party specifically waives any right to trial by jury in any court in connection with any action

or litigation.

Any claims under these terms shall proceed individually and no party shall join in a class action

or other proceeding with or on behalf of others.



US Users



Surviving provisions



This Agreement shall continue in effect until it is terminated by either Blue Ocean Law Group or the User.

Upon termination, the provisions contained in these Terms that by their context are intended to survive

termination or expiration will survive, including but not limited to the following:



the User’s grant of licenses under these Terms shall survive indefinitely;

the User’s indemnification obligations shall survive for a period of five years from the date of

termination;

the disclaimer of warranties and representations, and the stipulations under the section containing

indemnity and limitation of liability provisions, shall survive indefinitely.

Dispute resolution



Amicable dispute resolution



Users may bring any disputes to the Owner who will try to resolve them amicably.



While Users' right to take legal action shall always remain unaffected, in the event of any controversy

regarding the use of Blue Ocean Law Group or the Service, Users are kindly asked to contact the Owner at

the contact details provided in this document.



The User may submit the complaint including a brief description and if applicable, the details of the related

order, purchase, or account, to the Owner’s email address specified in this document.



The Owner will process the complaint without undue delay and within 21 days of receiving it.



Online dispute resolution for Consumers



The European Commission has established an online platform for alternative dispute resolutions that

facilitates an out-of-court method for solving disputes related to and stemming from online sale and service

contracts.



As a result, any European Consumer or Consumer based in Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein can use such

platform for resolving disputes stemming from contracts which have been entered into online. The platform

is available at the following link.



Germany: Dispute resolution procedure with Consumer conciliation boards



The Owner does not participate in alternative dispute resolution procedures for Consumers under the

German Verbraucherstreitbeilegungsgesetz.

France: Mediation



Within one year of submitting a written complaint to the Owner regarding any dispute stemming from these

Terms, Consumers have the right to initiate a mediation procedure before



any mediation body approved by the French Government. The relevant list is available at the following

link: https://www.economie.gouv.fr/mediation-conso/mediateurs-references.
