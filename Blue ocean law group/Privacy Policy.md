Your privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act and how to

exercise them



The right to access personal information: the right to know and to portability



You have the right to request that we disclose to you:



the categories of personal information that we collect about you;

the sources from which the personal information is collected;

the purposes for which we use your information;

to whom we disclose such information;

the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.



You also have the right to know what personal information is sold or shared and to whom. In

particular, you have the right to request two separate lists from us where we disclose:



the categories of personal information that we sold or shared about you and the categories of third

parties to whom the personal information was sold or shared;

the categories of personal information that we disclosed about you for a business purpose and the

categories of persons to whom it was disclosed for a business purpose.



The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12

months.



If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an

easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance —

provided that this is technically feasible.



The right to request the deletion of your personal information



You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth

by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors

on Blue Ocean Law Group, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to

exercise certain rights etc.).



If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and

notify any of our service providers and all third parties to whom we have sold or shared the personal

information to do so — provided that this is technically feasible and doesn’t involve disproportionate effort.



The right to correct inaccurate personal information



You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information we maintain about you,

taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal

information.



The right to opt out of sale or sharing of personal information and to limit the use of your

sensitive personal information



You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. You also have the right to

request that we limit our use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information.



The right of no retaliation following opt-out or exercise of other rights (the right to non-

discrimination)



We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. This means that we will not

discriminate against you, including, but not limited to, by denying goods or services, charging you a different

price, or providing a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your consumer

privacy rights.



However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your

personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or

services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.



To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer you promotions, discounts, and other deals in exchange for

collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information, provided that the financial incentive offered is

reasonably related to the value of your personal information.



How to exercise your rights



To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via

the details provided in this document.



For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise

the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:



provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we

collected personal information or an authorized representative;

describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond

to it.



We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal

information in our possession actually relates to you.



Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use any

personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the

purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than

necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.



If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California

Secretary of State to act on your behalf.



If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a child under your parental authority.



You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.



How and when we are expected to handle your request



We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will

process your request.



We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to

you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to

90 days to fulfill your request.



Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period. Only with regard to personal information

collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond the

12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a

disproportionate effort.



Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.



We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly

unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In

either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
