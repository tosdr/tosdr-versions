Introduction
------------

#### Resume Worded's goal is to help people (i.e. jobseekers, professionals) develop their careers through a career development platform. We are able to do this by providing:  
1) a resume analysis engine that uses advanced machine learning, artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques to identify errors and potential issues on applicant resumes, and recommends improvements.  
2) a job description analysis engine that identifies keywords and skills on job descriptions and resumes  
3) a LinkedIn profile analysis engine that uses natural language processing techniques to identify errors and potential issues on people's LinkedIn Profiles, and recommends improvements.  
4) written content and general career advice  
All these products and any future products have the goal of helping job applicants write better resumes or LinkedIn profiles, and get more interviews and opportunities.

Premium Accounts and Subscriptions ('Resume Worded Pro')
--------------------------------------------------------

#### Some features are only accessible to Premium members, also referred to as 'Resume Worded Pro' members. These can be purchased directly on our site. Alternatively, they can be provided via your organization (e.g. business or university) if they have already been prepaid.  
These features include:  
(a) Searchable database of over 200 resume lines  
(b) Full resume reviews using Score My Resume (Resume Worded's resume analytics engine)  
(c) Database of over 50 metrics  
(d) Suggested resume lines through Score My Resume  
(e) Resume templates  
(f) Resume line-by-line analysis  
(g) Targeting with Targeted Resume  
(h) Full LinkedIn reviews using LinkedIn Review  
  
For Resume Worded Pro members, you agree to pay all applicable fees (inclusive of taxes) and provide us with the necessary payment information in order to access Resume Worded Pro features and any default in payment of these fees may result in termination of your Resume Worded Pro Service. There are multiple payment plans available for Resume Worded Pro members, including a subscription based offering (monthly or quarterly) and a one-time option (one year). Users/members are expected to cancel/update their subscriptions in their account portal.  

  
  
  

Billing process/cycles for Resume Worded Pro members/subscribers
----------------------------------------------------------------

#### When you sign up for any of our subscription Premium plans, you will be billed every calendar month (Monthly Plan) or Quarterly (every 3 months Plan) from the date of subscription. Until you cancel, billing will continue according to the cycle stated at the time of subscription.  
  
Resume Worded is not responsible for continued subscriptions should a user forget to cancel their account. It is the customer’s responsibility to confirm the cancellation.

  
  
  

Payments and orders are handled by Paddle
-----------------------------------------

Our order process is conducted by our online reseller Paddle.com. Paddle.com is the Merchant of Record for all our orders. Paddle provides all customer service inquiries and handles returns.  
  
  

Refunds
-------

#### Due to the nature of our offering, we are unable to provide refunds to new users who purchase for the first time. The reason is that Resume Worded is a Freemium product and you can "inspect the product" and all the site's features in a limited capacity for free, before becoming a paid member (i.e. You get a subset of resume lines for free, subset of the resume analysis is free with Score My Resume, and all our tools have a free tier). Our free tier is extremely generous, and we encourage you to use all features so you know exactly what's in the paid version.  
  
To protect ourselves from abuse (i.e. people buying the product, using it to the fullest, and requesting a refund when they are done using it), we can't refund new users. We do this because our AI technology is very expensive to run, so we are unable to refund you for costs we have already incurred.  
  
If you'd like to apply for a refund, please do so on [this page](https://resumeworded.com/refund-request). Our customer support team will look into your case thoroughly and get back to you within 72 hours. Please fill in that form or contact us before filing a dispute with your credit card company, because once that is done, we do not have any control over the refund process and will have to wait until the full investigation takes place (typically takes 6 months by your credit card company). You'll likely then have to wait several months before a refund can be issued in those cases, so a much quicker way to get your refund is to contact our support team.  
  
**Existing Pro members who forgot to cancel:**  
If you're an existing Pro member and you forgot to cancel your subscription in time before it renewed, please contact us immediately (maximum within 3 days of your billing date). You can contact us via [this form](https://help.resumeworded.com/) or via email at support {at} resumeworded.com. If you have not used the service in the time between being billed and the time of contacting us, we'll be able to provide refunds depending on the circumstances. Please note that we are unable to offer refunds if you contact us outside the 3 day window.  
  

  
  
  

Modifications
-------------

#### We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Service at any time and you agree to be bound by such changes, modifications or alterations.

Your continued use of our Site and/or Services after any changes will signify and confirm your acceptance of those changes.

the Site and/or Services for changes.  

  
  
  

Upload Limits and 'Fair Use' Policy
-----------------------------------

#### We offer a service that allows users to upload resumes and LinkedIn files to our service for review, with the option to purchase an upgrade to a Pro account for 'unlimited' uploads. While we offer 'unlimited uploads' to Pro users, we have a fair use policy in place to prevent abuse of our software. This fair use policy allows users to access and use our core tools (Score My Resume, Targeted Resume and LinkedIn Review) up to a maximum of 250 times per month.  
  
If we determine that a user's use of our software exceeds this fair use limit, we reserve the right to terminate their Pro account and prevent further access to our software. We also reserve the right to take legal action against any user who violates our fair use policy or otherwise abuses our software.
