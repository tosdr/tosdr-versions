1\. Oscobo does not associate your searches from your online accounts.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The most popular search engines offer other services which often collect sensitive personal information such as email (Gmail, Outlook Webmail) and social web services (Google+ and YouTube). When you search the web and remain logged into these accounts, your search queries can be easily connected to your profile.

Oscobo completely disconnects your searches from being tied to your email accounts and social profiles.

2\. Request, log or share your personal information.
----------------------------------------------------

Oscobo doesn't collect or maintain any personal information except your IP. Your IP is used to determine your location and thereby assist us in displaying relevant search results and advertisements.
