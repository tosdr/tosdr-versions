Privacy Policy
==============

Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this policy in order for you to understand how we  
collect, use, communicate and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.

When accessing the https://spacial.com website, Spacial Audio will learn certain information  
about you during your visit.

Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard [technology](https://www.brreplicasderelogios.com.br/) called ‘cookies’ (see explanation  
below) and server logs to collect information about how our site is used. Information gathered through cookies and  
server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our site, and the websites visited  
just before and just after our own, as well as your IP address.

#### Use of Cookies

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website,  
that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically  
designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but  
(to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website  
to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

#### IP Addresses

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is  
used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server  
as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be  
sent to you.

#### Email Information

If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your  
email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in  
the maintenance of information received online, mail and telephone. This also applies when you register for our website,  
sign up through any of our forms using your email address  
or make a purchase on this site. For further information see the email policies below.

#### How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?

Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer  
service and making available other items and services to our customers and prospective customers.

Spacial Audio will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to  
provide such information to us, nor will such information be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties  
without the approval of the user at the time of collection.

We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the  
law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.

#### Email Policies

We are committed to keeping your e-mail address confidential. We do not [sell](https://www.noob.to/), rent, or lease our subscription lists to  
third parties, and we will not provide your personal information to any third party individual, government agency, or  
company at any time unless strictly compelled to do so by law.

We will use your e-mail address solely to provide timely information about Spacial Audio.

We will maintain the information you send via e-mail in accordance with applicable federal law.

provide clear information on how to contact the sender. In addition, all e-mail messages will also contain concise  
information on how to remove yourself from our mailing list so that you receive no further e-mail communication from us.

#### Choice/Opt-Out

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners by reading the  
unsubscribe instructions located at the bottom of any e-mail they receive from us at anytime.
