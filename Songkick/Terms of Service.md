We may, but have no obligation to:  (a) monitor, evaluate or alter Submissions before or after they appear on the Site; (b) seek to verify that all rights, consents, releases and permissions in or relating to such Submission have been obtained by you in accordance with your representations above; (c) refuse, reject or remove any Submission at any time or for any reason (including, without limitation, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that all rights, consents, releases and permissions have not been obtained by you despite your representations above).  You agree to cooperate with us in our verification or inquiries related to the foregoing.  We may disclose any Submissions and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to anyone for any reason or purpose, and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.  If you become aware of any unlawful, offensive or objectionable material(s) on the Site (except for material that infringes copyright, which is addressed in Section 26 below), contact us [here](mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com) with your name and address, a description of the material(s) at issue and the URL or location of such materials.

**9\. Products**. All rights in any products available through the Site, such as music, ring tones, ring back tones, SMS tones, images (e.g., screen savers), video, artwork, text, software including but not limited to widgets and media player plugins, information and features including but not limited to exclusive artist content, contests, artist merchandise, downloadable media, advertisements, photographs, graphics and other copyrightable materials (collectively, the “**Products**”) are owned by us, our Affiliates and/or our (or their) licensors. Some of these Products may only be accessible on or through certain parts of the Services; for example, special fan club pre-sale information may not be available to you unless you are a part of an artist’s fan club on the Services. We may, in its sole discretion, remove, modify, or otherwise change your ability to access any content on the Services at any time. If a separate agreement provided by us or an Affiliate governs a particular Transaction (as defined in Section 10 below) or Product, or your use of a particular Product, and the terms of such separate agreement conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of such separate agreement will govern such transaction or use. Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other applicable terms and conditions imposed by us, our Affiliates and/or our licensors, you have a limited right to use those Products that you purchase or access through the Site solely for your personal, noncommercial use in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any other terms and conditions that may apply to such Products, which right you cannot sublicense to others. Any burning or exporting capabilities, if any, of any Product shall not constitute a grant or waiver of any of our rights or those of any copyright or other rights owners in such Product, any other Product or any content, sound recording, underlying musical composition, artwork or other copyrightable matter embodied in or associated with such Product or any other Product. You understand that the Site and the Products may include and/or rely on a security framework using technology that protects digital information and imposes usage rules established by us, our Affiliates and our (or their) licensors, and you hereby agree to abide by such usage rules, including those set forth below. Unless we expressly provide otherwise, all Transactions, all Products and your use of such Products are subject to this Agreement.

**10\. Purchases**. If you wish to purchase any Products made available through the Site (each such purchase, a “**Transaction**”), you may be asked to supply certain information in connection with such Transaction, including without limitation your credit card number or other payment account number (for example, your wireless account number), your billing address, and your shipping information. BY INITIATING A TRANSACTION, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU (A) ARE EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER AND (B) HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE THE PAYMENT MEANS SELECTED BY YOU. By submitting such information, you grant us the right to use such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, by providing such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction.

Descriptions and images of, and references to, Products on the Site do not imply our endorsement of such Products. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, we reserve the right, with or without prior notice, to change such descriptions, images, and references; to limit the available quantity of any Product; to honor, or impose conditions on the honoring of, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code or other similar promotions; to bar any user from making any or all Transaction(s); and/or to refuse to provide any user with any Product. Price and availability of any Product offered through the Site are subject to change without notice. In the event that a Product is listed at an incorrect price or with other incorrect information, we have the right to refuse or cancel any Transaction for such Product.
