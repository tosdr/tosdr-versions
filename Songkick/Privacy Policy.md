Some of the non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available here). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission (including the United States), we have put in place standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission regarding Personal Information transfers as a safeguard for the transfer of your information. You may obtain a copy of this safeguard by contacting privacy@songkick.com or consult the standard terms by following this link.

YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

Privacy Rights if you are located in the EEA or your Personal Information is held by a Warner Music Company in the EEA:

By law, you have a number of rights (subject to certain conditions and exceptions) when it comes to your information. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us at [privacy@songkick.com](mailto:privacy@songkick.com) or through our details in the contact section below.

| The right to erasure | This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your Personal information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions. |

10.2 United Kingdom (UK)
------------------------

DO WE TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

EEA countries are recognised by the UK as providing an adequate level of data protection and as such transfers of your Personal Information from the UK to an EEA country are currently permitted under UK law.
