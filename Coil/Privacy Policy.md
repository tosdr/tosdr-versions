An open letter to the community
-------------------------------

February 2, 2023  
‍  
When we started Coil in 2018, Interledger was only an idea. Over the last five years we breathed life into the technology and sparked a vibrant ecosystem around it. Now it’s time to pass the torch to a neutral body in the form of the [Interledger Foundation](https://interledger.org/) to steward the future development of Interledger.  
  
As part of this evolution, we’ve decided to sunset Coil’s products and development efforts. On February 2, 2023, we will no longer accept sign-ups for the Coil Membership. On March 15, 2023, we will discontinue our service. More detailed information is available in our [FAQ](#FAQs).  
  
Coil's approach of providing memberships was always meant as a stepping stone to establish [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) as the first open standard for creators and developers to get paid on the Web. In the near future there will be full-featured Interledger wallets powering Web Monetization and many other use cases. Personally, my work on Interledger will continue and I’ll stay involved at the Interledger Foundation as Chairperson of the Board.  
  
To the Coil and Interledger communities, I want to say a huge thank you for your support and contributions. There is much more left to do and I'm excited to [carry on this work](https://interledger.org/get-involved) with all of you!  
  
‍_– Stefan Thomas, Founder of Coil_
