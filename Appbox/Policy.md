5.5.

If Appbox is notified by a third party (including any law enforcement authority) of a (suspected) violation by Customer and/or the End-User of the Acceptable Use Policy and/or any applicable law (an “Abuse Notification”), Appbox shall notify Customer hereof by way of email or such other method of communication as Appbox deems appropriate.

13.2. Customer shall, within the response period or remedy period set forth in Appbox’s notification (the “Remedy Period”), take remedial action to cure the violation and within the Remedy Period inform Appbox of the actions taken by Customer.

13.3. In some cases, Appbox may grant the Customer the option to contest the alleged violation by filing a counter notice (a “Counter Notice”). If Customer chooses to file a Counter Notice, Customer must use the online form made available to Customer for this purpose. Appbox shall review the submitted information and may (in Appbox’s sole discretion) decide to reject Customer’s Counter Notice, and require Customer to take immediate remedial action, if – in Appbox’s sole discretion – Customer’s or the End-User’s content or actions are unmistakably unlawful and/or may subject Appbox to third party claims and/or litigation.

13.4. If Appbox does not reject Customer’s Counter Notice, Customer shall – upon Appbox’s request – provide a deposit or a bank guarantee or a parent guarantee or other security satisfactory to Appbox. The amount of the security will be determined by Appbox at its sole discretion. The security is intended to cover Customer’s obligations, and any claim of Appbox, under the indemnity specified in the Sales Terms and Conditions. Furthermore, in the event that Customer files a Counter Notice, Customer shall within two (2) days of its response to Appbox notify Appbox whether an attorney will be representing Customer and, if so, which attorney.

13.5. Customer shall provide Appbox with all documents and information in connection with the Abuse Notification without cost and on first demand.

13.6. As a condition to the (continued) provision of Services and/or to resuming the provision of Services, Appbox shall be entitled to require Customer: (i) to execute a cease and desist declaration; and/or – as appropriate – (ii) to confirm in writing that Customer’s End User who was responsible for the violation, has been permanently excluded from using the Service.

**14\. REPEAT INFRINGERS AND LIVE VIDEO STREAMS**

14.1. As part of its abuse handling procedure, Customer should make reasonable efforts to detect repeated efforts by its End Users to store or transfer or distribute – on or via Customer’s services – (i) materials or data that violate or infringe the Acceptable Use Policies; or (ii) that Customer previously deleted or disabled further to receipt of an Abuse Notification.

14.2. Customer shall immediately terminate the provision of service to an End User -and terminate an End User’s access to the Service- in the event that such End User is discovered to be a repeat infringer or violator of the Appbox Acceptable Use Policies.

14.3. In the event Customer’s services are repeatedly used for streaming of live video and/or audio, Customer shall offer an online tool to trusted third parties (or their agents) to allow them to immediately terminate live video streams that are infringing on the intellectual property rights of these trusted third parties.

**15\. IP CONNECTIVITY**  
15.1. The IP Connectivity Service is provided for Customer’s consistent, fair, and reasonable use.

15.2. Customer’s use of IP Connectivity shall be deemed unfair and unreasonable, if Appbox determines (in its sole discretion) that Customer’s actual or projected use of IP Connectivity exceeds, or is likely to exceed, the monthly Committed Bandwidth or Committed Data Traffic, and such use affects the provision of services by Appbox to other Appbox customers. If the Customer has not agreed to Committed Bandwidth or Committed Data Traffic, then for the purpose of interpreting this clause 15.2 only, the Committed Bandwidth or Committed Data Traffic (as applicable) shall be deemed the lowest value of the Committed Bandwidth or Committed Data Traffic offered by Appbox for the respective Service.

15.3. Customer’s use of IP Connectivity is deemed to be inconsistent, if Customer’s use thereof results in irregular Bandwidth or Data Traffic usage patterns, either on a per server basis or as part of a group of Customer’s servers/Instances.

**16\. CLOUD SERVICES**  
16.1. Compute Capacity of the Cloud Platform for the Public Cloud Services is provided to Customer on a shared basis. To protect the performance and integrity of the Cloud Platform, Customer shall, in respect of Public Cloud Service, ensure that its use of Compute Capacity shall be fair and reasonable.

16.2. Customer’s use of Compute Capacity shall be deemed unfair and unreasonable by Appbox, if Customer’s use exceeds Appbox’s overbooking factor in such a way that (in Appbox’s reasonable opinion) it may affect the performance of other Infrastructure on the Cloud Platform.

16.3. Storage components of the Cloud Platform are provided to Customer on a shared storage system, and therefore Customer’s use of the Cloud Services may affect the performance (such as latency, storage bandwidth and IOPS) of the storage system as a whole. To protect the performance and integrity of the Cloud Platform, Customer shall ensure that its use of the storage shall be fair and reasonable.

**17\. SHARED WEB HOSTING SERVICE**

b) IMAP exceeds 5 connections per IP address;

c) twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the system resources are used in connection with Shared Web Hosting Services for longer than ninety (90) seconds at a time. Activities that could cause this excessive use include, but are not limited to, CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP;

and/or

e) Customer runs any MySQL queries longer than twenty (20) seconds. MySQL tables should be indexed appropriately.

**CHAPTER E. SECURITY POLICY**

**19\. MONITORING / REPORTING**  
19.1. Customer shall implement logging and monitoring measures for security-related events.

19.2. Customer shall immediately report to Appbox’s NOC any security-related event that may materially impact Appbox’s Infrastructure, Appbox’s organisation or Appbox’s provision of services to other customers. Customer shall make the log in relation to such event immediately available to Appbox upon Appbox’s request, and shall follow any directions given by Appbox’s as may be required to contain or correct the event.

Appbox shall be entitled to take action, legal or otherwise, against Customer and/or and End User, in the event that the use of the Service by Customer or its End User(s), breaches the Policies, or Customer allegedly fails to comply with any obligation under the Policies. The appropriate action will be determined by Appbox, in its sole discretion, and may include: (a) suspension or termination of any or all of the Services in accordance with the Sales Terms and Conditions; (b) (selective) IP or port blocking; (c) reinstallation of the Services; (d) imposing limits on the use of Service (such as imposing limits on the speed of the data the Customer may transmit and/or receive with the Service); (e) restarting the Service, (f) blocking access at the router and/or switch level of Customer’s Infrastructure; (g) denying Customer (physical) access to Infrastructure; (h) providing binding instructions to Customer in regards of the use of the Services, and/or (i) placing files infected by Malicious Software in quarantine.

**27\. DISCLAIMER**  
27.1. Without prejudice to the above or any other provision of the Policies, Appbox does not intend to review, monitor or control as a precautionary measure content sent or received by Customers using the Services.
