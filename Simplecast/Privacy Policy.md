Privacy Policy
==============

Simplecast is committed to transparency and protecting your privacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Simplecast. Simplecast cares about online privacy and takes the security of your information very seriously. This policy covers the collection and usage of your personal information. Please read it carefully. If you have any questions concerning our privacy policy, send us a message at [support@simplecast.com](mailto:support@simplecast.com).

This Privacy Policy covers the collection and usage of your personal information whenever you visit on Simplecast.com, any other website created with Simplecast, stream or download any file hosted by Simplecast on behalf of a Simplecast customer (collectively, the “Simplecast Websites”) or use any Simplecast Products or Services as a customer. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “you,” “your,” and “user” shall refer to any user and/or visitor of any of the Simplecast Websites. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, your use of any of the Simplecast Websites, and/or any of the Products and Services offered or provided by Simplecast, including the addition of new properties, shall be governed by this Privacy Policy and the Simplecast Terms and Conditions Agreement, where applicable, whether or not you register as a user. We may also offer or provide services from time to time that are governed by the privacy policy of the respective service providers, and you agree to be further bound by any rules that are applicable to Simplecast with respect to the service providers. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, at our discretion. We will provide notice of such changes as described in the “Amendments and Changes to this Privacy Policy” section below. This Privacy Policy also incorporates by reference our [Data Processing Addendum](https://simplecast.com/dpa/?hsLang=en).

### Information Collection and Use by Simplecast.

We collect and use information for business and commercial purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Our business purposes for collecting and using information include:

* To operate and make available the Simplecast Products and Services;
* For billing and fraud prevention, to conduct business to comply with our legal obligations;
* To analyze the use of the Simplecast Products and Services and for internal market research to improve and grow our business;
* To contact you and deliver (via email, chat, SMS, push notifications, or otherwise) product and service updates, transactional information, administrative notices, special events, contests, special offers, marketing notifications, offers and communications relevant to your use of the Simplecast Products and Services, with your consent when required under applicable law, as necessary to communicate with you about our Products and Services and promote our business;
* To provide you with customer support in using Simplecast Products and Services and in order to fulfill our contracts with Users;
* To enforce the Simplecast Terms and Conditions Agreement and ensure it is complied with; and
* As otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy and the Simplecast Terms and Conditions Agreement.

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, Simplecast also logs non-personally identifiable information which includes, without limitation, IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, device type and browser type, from users of the Simplecast Websites. This data is used to improve the Simplecast Websites services, to analyze trends, to administer the the Simplecast Websites, to provide Simplecast Products and Services, to track user movement around the Simplecast Websites and to gather information about our user base as a whole. Simplecast will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to users. User IP addresses are unlinkable to the personally identifying information of any particular user.

Simplecast may use pixel tags (tiny graphic images) to tell us what parts of the Simplecast Websites have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches users perform on the Simplecast Websites. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format users can read, and they also tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we’re only sending email messages that are of interest to our users. Simplecast stores all of this information in a secure database.

**Use of Cookies.** Like most companies, Simplecast uses cookies to store user preferences and to record session information for various purposes, including, without limitation, market research to help us determine how best to provide useful information to users and to understand which parts of the Simplecast Websites and internet services are of most interest to them, to customize the newsletter, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user profile information, to help track usage to help us understand which parts of the Simplecast Websites are the most popular, where our users are going, and how much time they spend there, to make usage of the Simplecast Websites even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our communications with users and to customize each user’s experience and provide greater convenience. Please rest assured, Simplecast doesn’t link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Simplecast Websites. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences; however, you must enable cookies from Simplecast in order to use most functions on the site.

We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics service. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the Simplecast Websites. The information generated by cookies about your use of the Simplecast Websites and the Simplecast Products and Services (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server in the United States. Google uses this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Simplecast Websites, compiling reports on site activity for site operators, and providing site operators with other services relating to site activity and Internet usage. You can prevent the storage of data relating to your use of the Simplecast Websites and created via the cookie (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.). You can obtain additional information on Google Analytics’ collection and processing of data and data privacy and security at the following links: [How Google Uses Information From Sites Or Apps That Use Our Services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) and [Analytics Help](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631).

### Sharing / Disclosure.

* From time to time, Simplecast (itself or with a third party partner who will safeguard your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy) may sponsor a promotion, sweepstakes, or contest on the Simplecast Websites. In such cases users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address, or to answer questions in order to participate. Simplecast may transfer such personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply and you will always be provided with an opportunity to opt-out.
* Simplecast does not sell or rent your contact information to marketers. To help us provide superior service, we may share your personal information with third parties who are obligated to safeguard it in accordance with the law and this Privacy Policy (for example, Simplecast’s customer service platform, email service provider, etc.). There are also times when it may be advantageous for Simplecast to make certain personal information about you available to companies with which Simplecast has a strategic relationship or that perform work for Simplecast to provide products and services to you on our behalf (for example, our billing provider, or when Simplecast integrates with another company’s product so we can make their products and services available to you as part of your use of Simplecast, etc.). These companies may help us process information, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with the law and Simplecast’s policies. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the Simplecast website.
* Simplecast will not disclose personal information to any third-party unless in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
* We do not sell our data to third parties. Simplecast reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of Simplecast or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.
* We use and partner with different types of entities to assist with our daily operations and offer Simplecast Products and Services. They each receive some information we collect and process it for us pursuant to a subprocessing agreement between us that requires them to abide by the law and safeguard user information. The list of the parties with whom we share information and for what purposes is available at Simplecast.com/subprocessors. See also our [Data Processing Addendum](https://simplecast.com/dpa/?hsLang=en).

**Links to Third-Party Websites.** Simplecast contains links to third party websites. Simplecast is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of or on other websites. When linking to another website, a user should read the privacy policy stated on that website. Our privacy policy only governs information collected on the Simplecast Websites.

**Notice Regarding the Privacy of Children Under 13.** None of the Simplecast Websites are directed to or recommended for use by children under the age of 13. We operate the Simplecast Websites in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and do not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age.

**Tracking User Activity.** Simplecast may send email messages which use or otherwise contain a “click-through URL” that is linked to content on the Simplecast Websites. When the “click-through URL” is clicked on or otherwise activated, the party who clicked on or otherwise activated the “click-through URL” is taken through the Simplecast web server(s) before arriving at the destination page. During this process, “click-through data” is collected by Simplecast, which may include, without limitation, data that helps us determine interest in particular topics and data that helps us measure the effectiveness of the communications we send out. If you prefer not to be tracked in this manner, simply avoid clicking on or otherwise activating text or graphic links in the email. We do not authorize third party services to track our customers’ RSS feeds or shows without both Simplecast and our customers’ permission.

**Concerning Content you Add to Simplecast.** Any content that you add, upload, post, publish, or otherwise disseminate through the Products and Services offered by Simplecast should be considered fully accessible by the public and not private. Such content, once published, may immediately become accessible on search engines and other sites. It is important that you are mindful of this fact.

**Email Preferences / Opting-Out.** Occasionally, Simplecast may send email regarding news, promotions, surveys, updates, or offers related to Simplecast. Users who no longer wish to receive these emails may choose not to by simply opting-out. To opt-out, simply click on the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email. It is important to note, users cannot opt-out of email regarding legal notices or user account changes.

**Information Retention.** Simplecast retains personal data for as long as you are a user in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for a longer period as may be in our legitimate business interests and to comply with our legal obligations. We may also retain data from which you cannot directly be identified, for example where stored against a randomly-generated identifier, so we know the data relates to a single User, but we cannot tell who that User is. We use this kind of data for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services, and we take appropriate measures to ensure you cannot be re-identified from this data.

**Compliance with Law.** Simplecast may preserve any Content contained on or about its web server(s) and may also disclose such Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith that preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with a search warrant or other legal process received by Simplecast; (b) enforce the Terms and Conditions; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Simplecast, its users and the public.

**Data Transmission.** You acknowledge and agree that the technical processing and transmission of the Products and Services, including any of your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to the technical requirements of connecting the networks or devices.

**Security.** Simplecast Accounts are secured by user-created (as applicable) passwords. Simplecast takes precautions to ensure that account information is kept private through reasonable measures such as encryption to protect private information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to such private information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note, however, that Simplecast cannot and does not guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user account information at any time. Users are urged to take precautions to protect their personal data by changing passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers, and using a secure web browser. For any additional information about the security measures Simplecast uses on the Simplecast Websites, please contact us at [privacy@simplecast.com](mailto:privacy@simplecast.com).

**Amendments and Changes to this Privacy Policy.** From time to time, Simplecast may make changes to this Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will post them on this URL to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A user is bound by any minor changes to the Privacy Policy when she or he uses the the Simplecast Websites after those changes have been posted. If, however, we are going to use a user’s personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting a notice on Simplecast for 30 days.

**Accessibility Statement** Simplecast is committed to providing access to all users. We use the WCAG 2.1 AA level as our goal for access, and have partnered with accessibility consultant, Oleb Media, to provide us UX testing for a representative range of people with sensory, cognitive, and mobility related impairments. All of our players meet WCAG 2.1 A and AA levels, and we are working hard to update our website and user dashboard. If you run into any access problems on our site, please contact [legal@simplecast.com](mailto:legal@simplecast.com).

### **California Residents Supplement**

These additional provisions apply to individuals who reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and requires business collecting or disclosing Personal Information to provide notice of rights California residents have and can exercise.

**California Notice of Collection.** We have collected information corresponding to the following categories of information enumerated in the CCPA:

**Sale of data.** Simplecast does not generally sell information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. However, to the extent “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed in the Simplecast’s Information Collection and Use section as a “sale,” we will comply with applicable law as to such activity.

**Simplecast data disclosures.** Simplecast discloses, anonymized and de-identified, the following categories of information regarding users for commercial purposes and to provide the Simplecast Products and Services:

* Commercial Information, and
* Inferences.

* The categories of Personal Information we have collected about you;
* The categories of sources from which the Personal Information was collected;
* The categories of Personal Information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold;
* The categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was disclosed for a business person or sold;
* The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the Personal Information; and
* The specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.

In addition, you have the right to delete the Personal Information we have collected from you, to the extent we do not have legitimate business interests or legal justification for keeping it.

In the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days. We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request. You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. We will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.

**Right to non-discrimination**. You have the right to non-discriminatory treatment by us, should you exercise any of your rights.

**Shine the light.** Customers who are residents of California may request: (i) a list of the categories of Personal Information disclosed by us to third parties during the preceding calendar year for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes, and (ii) a list of the categories of third parties to whom we disclose such information. To exercise a request, please contact us at [privacy@simplecast.com](mailto:privacy@simplecast.com). Requests must include “California Shine the Light Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code.
