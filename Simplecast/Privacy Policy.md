This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the collection and uses of personal data by Simplecast in the delivery of the Services and through the websites hosted on the simplecast.com domain (the “Websites”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection or use of personal data by other services offered by AdsWizz Inc., by platforms that distribute podcasts, or any content-related websites that are not hosted on the simplecast.com domain.

We maintain the aggregated information in de-identified format, and do not attempt, and contractually restrict other third parties from attempting, to reassociate aggregated information to individuals.

### 2\. Use of Pixels, Cookies, and Tags.

The Websites use cookies, pixels or tags or similar technologies to store the preferences of site visitors and to record session information for various purposes. Some cookies provide essential functions to the performance of the Website. Cookies, pixels or tags may also be used on the Websites to collect or transmit information to service providers and third parties that allow Simplecast or its Clients to track Website traffic, navigation, and overall usage, to determine how to best provide information to visitors, to monitor the effectiveness of our communication of the Services to potential Clients, to customize our newsletter, or to determine and improve the effectiveness of our or our Clients' advertising campaigns.

A Website reflecting the content of a particular Client that is hosted on a subdomain of simplecast.com may contain analytical or advertising cookies, pixels or tags placed by Simplecast for analytical purposes, or directly by the Client for analytics or to measure the effectiveness of the Client’s advertising directing users to the content page. Data collected or transmitted by Client-placed technologies is subject to the Client’s relationships with you as an end user of that Client’s content and with the data recipient. Please see any privacy policy offered by the podcast content owner for more information. Please note that Simplecast does not control the delivery of advertising within the podcast content stream, and advertising cookies on the Websites are independent of advertising that you may hear while listening to any given podcast content.  

You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject non-essential cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. In addition, you may disable analytical or advertising cookies for a Website through the cookie banner on the Website or the Cookie Settings link in the footer of the page. You may not disable essential cookies.

[View Simplecast’s Cookie Declaration and adjust your cookie preferences](https://simplecast.com/cookie-declaration/?hsLang=en)

Simplecast uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the Simplecast Websites. The information generated by cookies about your use of the Websites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server in the United States. Google uses this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Websites, compiling reports on site activity, and providing other services relating to site activity and Internet usage. You can prevent the storage of data relating to your use of the Simplecast Websites and created via the cookie (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.). You can obtain additional information on Google Analytics’ collection and processing of data and data privacy and security at the following links: [How Google Uses Information From Sites Or Apps That Use Our Services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) and [Analytics Help](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631).

Note that cookie settings and other technological controls are specific to the browser or device on which such control is implemented. When cookies or other such tags are disabled, we are not able to recognize you when you use a different device to access the Services, and therefore cannot apply the settings from the initial device. You will need to manage your cookies and tag settings as well as any global privacy controls individually on each device or browser with which you access the Services.

Global Privacy Control (GPC) and Do Not Track (DNT) Signals. Global Privacy Controls (“GPC”) and Do Not Track (“DNT”) offered by some web browsers are settings that automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences. When you choose to turn on the GPC/DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and/or other web services you encounter while browsing to exercise your privacy rights and stop tracking your activity. You can learn more about and set up GPC  [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about): [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about) and set up Do Not Track [here](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/): [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/). We comply with GPC as required under applicable law, but because there is no standardized response to browser DNT signals, the Websites do not respond to such signals.

### 3\. Disclosures and Sharing
