* If you do not Subscribe within 90 days following the end of the Free Trial, we will release your Site Link(s) into the public pool of available Site Links for other users to choose from and the Account will be queued for deletion.

**Billing.** When you Subscribe, you acknowledge, agree, and accept that:

    * _Foreign Transaction Fees_. For certain credit cards, the card issuer may charge a foreign transaction fee and/or other charges.
    * _Invalid Payment_. If a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration, insufficient funds, or other failure of your Payment Method, you remain responsible for any amounts not remitted to us and we may, in our discretion, either: (i) invoice you directly for the deficient amount, (ii) continue billing your Payment Method once it has been updated (if applicable), or (iii) terminate this Agreement.
    * _Changing Payment Method_. At any time, you may change your Payment Method by entering updated information in your account settings.

* If you are on our Professional or Enterprise plans and have agreed in the Sales Order to charges in connection with metered pricing or plan limit overages, we will invoice you following the end of each calendar month, with each such invoice covering the fees incurred during the preceding month (which will be based on our records).

YOU HEREBY WAIVE ALL LAWS THAT MAY LIMIT THE EFFICACY OF SUCH RELEASES. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO WAIVE THE PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH PROVIDES “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IS KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

**Confidential Information.** Each party will keep confidential all information and materials provided by the other party including all non-public information and know-how of the other party disclosed by any party hereunder in writing, orally, or by drawing or other form ("**Confidential Information**"). All such information disclosed by either party to the other, whether orally, in writing, by inspection or otherwise, will be deemed to be Confidential Information of the disclosing party unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the party disclosing such information, provided that such information is marked as “confidential” or bears a similar legend or is information that the receiving party knows, or reasonably should have known, is the Confidential Information of the disclosing party. Furthermore, the features and functionality of the Simplecast and/or AdsWizz Services, as well as any information regarding planned modifications or updates thereto or future products and services will also constitute Confidential Information of Simplecast and AdsWizz, respectively. Each party will keep and instruct its employees and agents to keep Confidential Information confidential by using at least the same care and discretion as used with that party’s own confidential information, but in no case less than a prudent and reasonable standard of care. Neither party will use Confidential Information other than for purposes of performing its obligations hereunder or as authorized by the disclosing party. Information or materials will not constitute Confidential Information if it is (i) in the public domain through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) known to the receiving party prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (iii) lawfully and rightfully disclosed to the receiving party by a third party on a non-confidential basis; or (iv) developed by the receiving party without reference to Confidential Information. Disclosure of Confidential Information will not be prohibited if such disclosure:  (i) is in response to a valid order of a court ordering such disclosure; provided, however, that the party subject to the court order will first, to the extent legally permitted, have given at least fifteen (15) days, advance written notice to the other party; or (ii) is otherwise required by law. If any party, its employees, or its agents breach or threatens to breach the obligations of these Confidential Information terms, the affected party may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction without the posting of a bond, in addition to its other remedies, as the inadequacy of monetary damages and irreparable harm are acknowledged.

**Mutual Representations, Warranties and Covenants.** Each party represents, warrants, and covenants to the other party that: (i) it has the full power and authority to enter into this Agreement; (ii) the execution of this Agreement and performance of its obligations under this Agreement does not violate any other agreement to which it is a party; and (iii) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation when executed and delivered.

**Construction.** This Agreement will be fairly interpreted and construed in accordance with its terms and without strict interpretation or construction in favor of or against either party. Each party has had the opportunity to consult with counsel in the negotiation of this Agreement. Section headings are for reference purposes only, and should not be used for purposes of interpretation.

**Severability.**  If any provision, or portion thereof, of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such determination will not impair or affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and each provision, or portion thereof, is hereby declared to be separate, severable, and distinct.

**Force Majeure.** Except for payment obligations, Simplecast and/or AdsWizz will not be liable to you or any other person, firm or entity for any failure of performance under this Agreement if such failure is due to any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of Simplecast, AdsWizz and/or their service providers, including, but not limited to, epidemics, pandemics, strikes, labor disputes, lockouts, or work stoppages, or other labor difficulties, shortages of labor or materials, riots, vandalism, civil disturbances, acts of terrorism, wars, third-party provider outages, cable cuts, power crisis shortages, internet failures, computer equipment failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures, electrical power failures, loss of or fluctuations in heat, light, or air conditioning, inclement weather, fires, floods, storms, explosions, and other uncontrollable acts of God or nature, or other similar occurrences; any law, order, regulation, direction, action or request of the United States or foreign government (including state and local governmental agency, department, commission, court, bureau, corporation or other instrumentality of any one or more of said governments) or of any civil or military authority, or national emergencies.

**Compliance with local laws.** Neither Simplecast nor AdsWizz makes any representation or warranty that the content available on the Services are appropriate in every country or jurisdiction, and access to the Services from countries or jurisdictions where its content is illegal is prohibited. Users who choose to access the Services are responsible for compliance with all local laws, rules and regulations.

**United State’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act:** Each party will, and will ensure that its affiliates and any third party contractors will, comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (as amended), and any analogous laws or regulations existing in any other country or region, in connection with its performance under this Agreement. Neither party will make any payment, either directly or indirectly, of money or other assets, including, but not limited to, compensation derived from this Agreement, to government or political party officials, officials of international public organizations, candidates for public office, or representatives of other businesses or persons acting on behalf of any of the foregoing, that would constitute a violation of any law, rule or regulation.

**Entire Agreement; Waiver.** This Agreement constitutes the complete, final, exclusive and entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto. Neither party is relying upon any warranties, representations, assurances or inducements not expressly set forth herein. You may be subject to additional third-party terms and policies based on your use of the Services. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement will only be valid if provided in writing and will only be applicable to the specific incident and occurrence so waived. The delay in exercising any right of Simplecast or AdsWizz, the failure to insist upon the strict performance of this Agreement, or the failure or partial failure to exercise any term hereof, will not act as a waiver of any right, promise or term, which will continue in full force and effect. Any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder does not preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder.

In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable Sales Order or other terms, this Agreement will govern. If any provision of this Agreement is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision will be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. The headings of sections and paragraphs in this Agreement are for convenience only and will not affect its interpretation.

**Choice of Laws.** This Agreement is governed by (and will be interpreted, construed and enforced in all respects under) the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles and without regard to regard to the actual state or country of incorporation or residence of the parties. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

**Assignment and Transfer.** You may not transfer or convey this Agreement or any of your obligations hereunder without our prior written consent, except that you may assign your rights and obligations under this Agreement without our consent in connection with any merger (by operation of law or otherwise), consolidation, reorganization, change in control or sale of all or substantially all of your assets or similar transactions. Otherwise, any assignment, transfer or conveyance by you in violation of this Agreement will be of no power or effect. By agreeing to this Agreement, you consent to the storing and processing of your personal information in the United States or in other countries. We use a range of measures to safeguard information, but these countries may have laws that are different from those of your country of residence. We may assign, transfer or convey your personal information in the event of a business transition such as, but not limited to, a merger, sale, asset or stock acquisition of us by another company, or other transaction or proceeding as set out in our Privacy Policy.

**Third Party Vendors.** Some of the Services are offered and/or provided to you through third parties with which we contract.

**Class Action Waiver.** Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor we will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity, and each party hereby waives any right to assert consolidated claims with respect to any disputes subject to arbitration under this Agreement or any disputes between the parties. No proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected proceedings.

**Relationship of the Parties.** You, on the one hand, and Simplecast and AdsWizz, on the other hand, are independent contractors under this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement will be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship. Except as set forth herein relating to the AdsWizz Services, neither party pursuant to this Agreement has authority to enter into agreements of any kind on behalf of the other and neither party will be considered the agent of the other. Nothing herein contained will give, or is intended to give, any rights of any kind to any third parties.

### Government Entity Addendum

This addendum ("**Addendum**") applies only to U.S. Government users of the Services. U.S. Government users of the Services will not have access to the products and services offered by AdsWizz, Inc. via Simplecast.

You, as a U.S. Government entity ("**Agency**"), are required when entering into agreements with other parties to follow applicable federal laws and regulations, including those related to ethics; privacy and security; accessibility; federal records; limitations on indemnification; fiscal law constraints; advertising and endorsements; freedom of information; and governing law and dispute resolution forum. Audios Ventures, Inc., d/b/a Simplecast ( “**Company**") and Agency (together, the “**Parties**") agree to modify the Company’s standard General Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement, available at [https://simplecast.com/terms](https://simplecast.com/terms?hsLang=en) (the “**Agreement**") to accommodate Agency’s legal status, its public (in contrast to private) mission, and other special circumstances. Accordingly, the Agreement is hereby modified by this Amendment as they pertain to Agency’s use of the Platform and Services.

1. **Government Entity.** “You” within the Agreement will mean the Agency itself and will not apply to, nor bind (i) the individual(s) who utilize the Platform or Services on Agency’s behalf, or (ii) any individual users who happen to be employed by, or otherwise associated with, the Agency. Company will look solely to Agency to enforce any violation or breach of the Agreement by such individuals, subject to federal law.
2. **Public Purpose.** Agency will use the Platform and Services solely in furtherance of Agency’s public purpose. Any requirement(s) set forth within the Agreement that use of the Platform and Services be for private, personal and/or non-commercial purposes is hereby waived.
3. **Agency Content Serving the Public.** Company will allow Agency’s distribution or other publication via the Site or Services of material that may contain or constitute promotions, advertisements or solicitations for goods or services, so long as the material relates to the Agency’s mission.
4. **Advertisements.** Company does not currently display advertisements on the Platform or through the Services. If, at a later date, Company decides to include any commercial advertisements or solicitations in the publicly available portion of the Site displaying content uploaded by or under the control of the Agency, the Agency will have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement and its use of the Platform and Services. This exclusion will not extend to house ads, which Company may place in a non-intrusive manner.
5. **Indemnification, Liability, Statute of Limitations.** Any provisions in the Agreement related to indemnification and filing deadlines are hereby waived, and will not apply except to the extent expressly authorized by law. Liability for any breach of the Agreement as modified by this Amendment, or any claim arising from the Agreement as modified by this Amendment, will be determined under the Federal Tort Claims Act, or other governing federal authority. Federal Statute of Limitations provisions will apply to any breach or claim. Liability of Company for any breach of the Agreement or this Amendment or any claim arising from the Agreement or this Amendment, will be determined by applicable U.S. Federal law.
6. **Governing Law.** Any arbitration, mediation or similar dispute resolution provision in the Agreement is hereby deleted. The Agreement and this Amendment will be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the United States of America without reference to conflict of laws. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of the State of California will apply in the absence of federal law.
7. **Changes to Standard Agreement.** If Company exercises its right to change the Agreement, Company will, whenever practicable, provide notice to subscribers with .gov email addresses alerting them to the change. Company acknowledges that changes to the Agreement may be the basis for Agency’s termination of this agreement and its use of the Platform and Services.
8. **Access and Use.** Company acknowledges that the Agency’s use of the Platform and Services may energize significant citizen engagement and otherwise become important to the Agency’s mission. Language in the Agreement allowing Company to terminate service or close the Agency’s account at any time, for any reason, is modified to reflect the Parties' agreement that Company may unilaterally terminate service and/or terminate Agency’s account only for breach of Agency’s obligations under the Agreement or Agency’s material failure to comply with the instructions and guidelines posted on the Simplecast site, or if Company ceases to operate the Simplecast site or Services generally. Company will provide Agency with a reasonable opportunity to cure any breach or failure on Agency’s part.
9. **Ownership of Names.** Any provision in the Agreement related to Company’s ownership of and right to change Your selected user name(s), user ID(s), domain name(s), channel name(s), and group name(s), are modified to reasonably accommodate Agency’s proprietary, practical, and/or operational interest in its own publicly-recognized name and the names of Agency programs.
10. **Modifications of Agency Content.** Any right Company reserves in the Agreement to modify or adapt Agency content is limited to technical actions necessary to index, format and display that content. The right to modify or adapt does not include the right to substantively edit or otherwise alter the meaning of the content. In the event Agency discovers that Agency content has been modified in a manner that alters the meaning of such content, Agency may contact Company and the Parties will work together in good faith to resolve the matter. In addition, the provision in the Agreement allowing the Company to remove any comment at any time in its sole discretion will not be applied to Agency accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Amendment will result in an expansion of Agency’s rights as a United States Government entity under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. §101 et seq.), specifically including Section 105 of such Act.
11. **Limitation of Liability.** The Parties agree that nothing in the Limitation of Liability clause or elsewhere in the Agreement in any way grants Company a waiver from, release of, or limitation of liability pertaining to, any past, current or future violation of federal law.
12. **Uploading; Deleting.** The Parties understand and agree that Agency is not obligated to place any user content on the Platform, and Company reserves the right to remove any and all of Agency’s Content at Company’s sole discretion.
13. **No Endorsement.** Company agrees that Agency’s seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, and the fact that Agency has a presence on the Platform and use its Services, will not be used by Company in such a manner as to state or imply that Company’s products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by Agency or by any other element of the Federal Government, or are considered by Agency or the Federal Government to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages whose design and content is under the control of Agency, or for links to or promotion of such pages, Company agrees not to display any Agency or government seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names on Company’s homepage or elsewhere on the Platform unless permission to do has been granted by Agency or by other relevant federal government authority. Company may list Agency’s name in a publicly available customer list on its homepage or elsewhere so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other third-party name.
14. **No Business Relationship Created.** The Parties are independent entities and nothing in the Agreement as modified by this Amendment creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employer/employee relationship.
15. **No-Cost Agreement.** Nothing in the Agreement as modified by this Amendment obligates Agency to expend appropriations or incur financial obligations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that none of the obligations arising from the Agreement as modified by this Amendment are contingent upon the payment of fees by one party to the other.
16. **Paid Services and Agency Obligation.** The Parties agree this Amendment applies to Agency’s usage of both free and paid Services that Company may provide. The Parties understand that fee-based products and services are categorically different from free products and services, and are subject to federal procurement rules and processes. Before an Agency decides to enter into a premium or enterprise subscription, or any other fee-based service that Company or alternative providers may offer now or in the future, Agency agrees (i) to determine if it has a need for those additional services for a fee; (ii) to consider the subscription’s value in comparison with comparable services available elsewhere; (iii) to determine that Agency funds are available for payment; (iv) to properly use the Government Purchase Card if such Card is used as the payment method; (v) to review any then-applicable Agreement for conformance to federal procurement law; and (vi) in all other respects to follow applicable federal acquisition laws, regulations, and agency guidelines when initiating that separate action.
17. **Assignment.** Neither Party may assign its obligations under the Agreement as modified by this Amendment to any third party without prior written consent of the other; provided however, Company or its subsidiaries may assign the Agreement as modified by this Amendment to a subsidiary or parent without written consent from the Agency provided that the successor assumes Company’s obligations under the Agreement as modified by this Amendment.
18. **Termination Rights.** Agency may close Agency’s account and terminate this Amendment at any time. Company may close Agency’s account and terminate this Amendment on 30 days’ written notice.
19. **Security.** Company will, in good faith, exercise due diligence using commercially reasonable business practices for information security designed to ensure that (i) systems are operated and maintained in a secure manner; and (ii) management, operational and technical controls are employed to ensure security of systems and data.
20. **Intellectual Property Ownership.** Except as expressly allowed in the Agreement, no rights to any derivative works, inventions, or Company product modifications are conferred on Agency or any other party. All such rights belong solely to Company.
21. **Precedence; Further Amendments.** If there is any conflict between this Amendment and the Agreement, or between this Amendment and other terms, rules or policies on the Platform or related to its Services, this Amendment will prevail. This Amendment constitutes an amendment to the Agreement; any language in the Agreement indicating it may not be modified or that it alone is the entire agreement between the Parties is waived. Any further amendment must be agreed to by both Parties in writing.
22. **Additional Items for Discussion and Possible Future Inclusion.** Company understands current federal law, regulation and policy may affect Agency’s use of Company’s products and Services in ways not addressed in the list of clauses above. Among the topics Agency may need to discuss with Company, and which may lead to a mutual agreement to insert additional clauses in this Amendment, are Privacy and Accessibility.
