* When Acronis collects data that includes personal information for service management purposes, such as to analyze, measure the effectiveness of and improve the Acronis Services, to identify and track and record customer support, to ensure the security and integrity of the Acronis Services and for billing and account management.
* When Acronis receives information about you from third parties, such as part of a corporate transaction (e.g., merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control by Acronis or any affiliate (in each case, whether in whole or in part); as part of a marketing activity (e.g., when we receive information on potential leads) and similar functions; or as part of other initiatives with business partners.
* When you engage with Acronis through social media. (Please contact [data-protection-office@acronis.com](mailto:data-protection-office@acronis.com) if you have questions about whether this Privacy Statement applies to personal information connected with a social media platform.).

Acronis’ processing of personal information also is described in our enterprise agreements (_**Customer Agreements**_) with managed service providers, distributors and other business customers (_**Business Customers**_). In Customer Agreements, except when Acronis processes personal information for service management purposes, Acronis acts as a processor. Certain data protection regulations, including GDPR, require controllers and their processors to put agreements into place with their processors and subprocessors that contain rules governing the processing of personal information. Acronis has prepared a standard Data Processing Agreement (_**DPA**_) for the parties with whom Acronis has an existing contract and whose data we store. If you are a business customer that would like to receive the Acronis Customer DPA, please contact your Partner account manager or Technical account manager or send a request to [data-protection-office@acronis.com](mailto:data-protection-office@acronis.com) or reach to [Acronis Customer Service and Support](https://www.acronis.com/support/).

If a provision of a Customer Agreement conflicts or otherwise is inconsistent with a provision of this Privacy Statement, then the term of the Customer Agreement will prevail but only to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.

If a particular part of the Acronis Services (such as the “Careers” portal) or another website or service links to a different privacy policy, then that privacy policy -- not the Privacy Statement – applies only when they are inconsistent. (Please make sure to check those other privacy policies to learn how your personal information are processed.)

2\. Controller of Personal Information
--------------------------------------

The controller for personal information collected pursuant to this Privacy Statement is Acronis International GmbH, Rheinweg 9, 8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland, unless otherwise stated in a separate privacy notice or in a Customer Agreement.

Acronis’ EU representative for data protection according to Art. 27 GDPR is Acronis International GmbH, Landsberger Straße 110, 80339 München, Germany, which can be contacted via [data-protection-office@acronis.com](mailto:data-protection-office@acronis.com).

3\. International Transfers of Personal Information
---------------------------------------------------

Use of the Acronis Services sometimes involves transfers and processing of personal information to jurisdictions other than your place of habitual residence. These other jurisdictions may have data protection laws that are different and, in some cases, not as protective (_**Other Jurisdictions**_).

Specifically, Acronis may transfer personal information to or from any of the jurisdictions in which we do business. The suppliers and business partners with which we may share personal information (as described below) are located in and transfer personal information to different countries around the world. In some cases, we may allow access to your personal information to individuals outside of the jurisdiction in which we collected that personal information, such as when Acronis personnel or processors based in USA or India that access your personal information to provide customer support.

To protect personal information subject to a cross-border transfer, Acronis has implemented technical and administrative safeguards that protect personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable data protection laws. These safeguards include implementing appropriate contracts, such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, the U.K.’s international data transfer agreement and other lawful cross-border transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal information among our affiliates, suppliers, business partners and customers. Please contact us at [data-protection-office@acronis.com](mailto:data-protection-office@acronis.com) to request a copy of the safeguards applicable to transfers or your personal information.

In some cases, use of the Acronis Services may involve international transfers of personal information which Acronis does not control, for example, when you enable a third-party integration with our Acronis Services. In such cases, you are responsible for evaluating and confirming the legality of the cross-border transfers.

4\. Changes to this Privacy Statement
-------------------------------------

We may amend this Privacy Statement to reflect new features of the Acronis Services and other business changes and for compliance with applicable laws. When Acronis updates this Privacy Statement, Acronis will post the updated version and change the Effective Date above. Acronis also will take appropriate measures to inform you in advance of changes that we believe reduce your privacy rights so that you have an opportunity to review the revised Privacy Statement before it applies to your personal information. If your consent is required by applicable data protection laws, Acronis will obtain your consent to changes before the revised Privacy Statement applies to your personal information. Otherwise, your continued use of the Acronis Services after the Effective Date constitutes acceptance of the amended Privacy Statement. As of the Effective Date, the then-current Privacy Statement supersedes all previous versions.

Acronis automatically collects some information using cookies, pixel, web beacons and similar technology tools (collectively, _**data collection technology**_). Please see Acronis’ [Cookie Notice](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/compliance/cookie-notice.html) for more information.

The Acronis Services uses Google Analytics and Enhanced Conversions, which are provided by Google.

Google Analytics: Google Analytics offers a suite of tools that help Acronis collect and analyze data related to use and performance of certain Acronis Services so that Acronis better understands users’ behavior and interactions with the Acronis Services. Acronis uses this information to help improve Acronis’ marketing campaigns and targeted advertising (which Google sometimes refers to as ‘remarketing’). Acronis uses both Universal Analytics properties and Google Analytics 4. For more details on the differences between Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4, please visit [https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13881440?hl=en&ref\_topic=3121765&sjid=17792924726686772507-EU](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13881440?hl=en&ref_topic=3121765&sjid=17792924726686772507-EU)

Google Tag Manager allows Acronis to deploy technologies like “conversion” pixels that record certain user actions (or “events”), such as "Whitepaper Downloaded" or "Product Purchased" based on the webpage visited or button clicked.

Targeted ad campaign tracking data are URL parameters added to a web address that include the campaign name, source, medium and a coded description of the type of ad that was run. Conversion events are recorded when a click is made or a page viewed, e.g., if a user from a Google Search ad clicks to a landing page and makes a purchase, Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics and the Google conversion pixel work together to show in Google Analytics that a campaign click resulted in a purchase. Acronis uses Google’s [IP anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9019185#zippy=%2Cin-this-article).

On behalf of Acronis, Google will use this information in Google Analytics to compile reports for Acronis and third parties that help operate and provide the Acronis Services.

Acronis does apply Google Consent Mode, Advanced tier. Consent mode communicates users’ cookie or app identifier consent status to Google. Tags adjust their behavior and respect users’ choices. For more information on Google Consent mode, please visit Google’s dedicated page: [https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10000067?hl=en](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10000067?hl=en)

Enhanced Conversions: Enhanced conversions is a feature used by Acronis to improve the accuracy of our conversion measurements for enabling sales and marketing activities. It supplements existing conversion tags by sending hashed first-party conversion data from our websites to Google in a privacy safe way. Acronis is capturing conversion data from our website – e.g., email, hash it, and send it to Google in a hashed form, so that we receive enhanced conversion insights. The feature uses a secure one-way [hashing algorithm](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9004451) called [SHA256](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9004655).

For more information on enhanced conversions, please visit [https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9888656?hl=en](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9888656?hl=en)

Certain Acronis Services also may embed videos from YouTube (a Google company) by framing. This means that, after you click the button to play a YouTube video through the Acronis Services, a connection between the Acronis Services and the YouTube servers is established. Then, an HTML link provided by YouTube is inserted into the code of the Acronis Services to create a playback frame. The video stored on the YouTube servers is then played by the frame in the Acronis Services. YouTube also receives information that informs YouTube that you are currently using the Acronis Services: your IP address, browser information, the operating system and settings of the device you are using, the URL of the current web page, previously-visited web pages if you have followed a link, and the videos you watched. If you are logged into your YouTube account, the information may be associated with your YouTube user profile. You can prevent this association by logging out of your YouTube account before using the Acronis Services and deleting the corresponding cookies.

For more information about how Google uses cookies in advertising, please visit Google’s Advertising ([https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)) page.

To prevent Google Analytics from using your data, you can install Google’s opt-out browser add-on ([https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)).

To opt out of ads on Google that are targeted to your interests, use your Google Ads settings ([https://adssettings.google.com/](https://adssettings.google.com/)).

If you are located in the EEA, Switzerland or UK, please note in particular that, if you allow Google’s cookies in the Acronis Privacy Preference Center, the information generated by those cookies about use of the Acronis Services is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

To learn more about personal information transfers by Google from the EU/UK to the U.S., please review Google’s [Data Privacy Framework Certification](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active0000001L5AAI&status=Active&hl=en_US).

**c. Acronis Customer Experience Programs**

Acronis collects certain personal information as part of the Acronis customer experience programs. The information collected through the Acronis customer experience programs helps Acronis provide more specific feedback and guidance about the Acronis Services and features operation and better analyze and improve the Acronis Services. Depending in the Acronis Services that you access and use, Acronis will ask for your consent. If you access and use the Acronis Services through a Customer Agreement, please contact the Customer for details.

For example, when we create a feature for our products, we track its usage, so that we understand if it is actually used and whether it works correctly. Another example is tracking how a new feature affects the product stability and the protected workload itself.

**d. Voice data**

Some of our Acronis Services offer voice control options. If you use voice control options, the Acronis Services allow you to request permission to activate a Google Chrome browser extension (see [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) for more information). This extension captures voice data using your device microphone and transfers the voice data to Google for processing. Acronis receives only a text version of voice commands, not voice data. Acronis uses the voice commands text for command execution. Since your voice data are processed by Google, how Google processes your voice data depends on your Google account settings and preferences. To learn more about how Google processes your voice data, please carefully read the Google’s Privacy Policy & Terms currently available at [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

**e. Information collected from third parties**

We receive information about you from resellers, distributors and other business partners. We also receive information about you from the third parties that help us operate the Acronis Services, such as for fraud detection, digital forensics, marketing services (such as when we acquire information on potential leads) and similar functions. When you allow it, Acronis also may receive information associated with your use of one of the Mobile Apps.

We may receive information from third parties who provide integrations with Acronis Services you choose to use. In such cases, we process the data as assumed by the integration.

Acronis may link personal information that we hold with personal information that we receive from third parties and with personal information available in public databases.

**f. Other information with your consent**

We also collect personal information when you give us consent at the time of collection for the purposes disclosed, such as if you decide to enable the in-product onboarding and interactive help feature.

**Acronis does not need sensitive personal information to provide the Acronis Services.** Acronis does not wish to receive sensitive personal information, such as precise geolocation; racial or ethnic origin; religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, biometric or genetic data used to identify an individual data concerning health, sex life or sexual orientation and similar information considered sensitive or especially private. Unless Acronis specifically requests it, please do not submit sensitive personal information to or though the Acronis Services. If you choose to provide Acronis with unsolicited sensitive personal information, you Acronis will process it only as necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. In the rare circumstances in which Acronis does seek to collect sensitive personal information, Acronis will do so in accordance with data protection laws. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you release Acronis and hold Acronis harmless from claims arising from or related to your unsolicited sensitive personal information.

**Note:** Acronis may process sensitive personal information, if provided by our Customers, who are using Acronis products (e.g., as part of their backups in content data). Acronis is not processing that sensitive personal information as a controller but as a processor subject to the respective Customer Agreements.

6\. Data Collection Technology
------------------------------

Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer's hard drive. To learn more about cookies and other data collection technologies, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/) or Acronis’ [Cookie Notice](https://www.acronis.com/compliance/cookie-notice.html). The Cookie Notice contains detailed description of the specific cookies and other data collection technology used in the Acronis Services, including their purpose and expiration period, are described. You can control and manage cookies using Acronis Privacy Preference Center.

**Do Not Track Signals**  
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" (_**DNT**_) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option, and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including Acronis, do not respond to DNT signals universally or if not required by law.

Acronis relies on third-party providers for obtaining geo-IP location information about its users.

**If at any time you believe that Acronis has not adhered to its specific privacy obligations, please contact us at** [data-protection-office@acronis.com](mailto:data-protection-office@acronis.com)**. We will use good faith efforts to determine and correct the problem.**

* **With Acronis affiliates:** Acronis shares personal information with its affiliates that process personal information for purposes consistent with this Privacy Statement or notified at the time of collection. For example, Acronis may share contact information of event attendees with our affiliates to maintain accurate marketing data. Access to personal information is restricted and granted on a need-to-know basis. Sharing of personal information is subject to the appropriate intracompany arrangements, policies and security safeguards.

* **As part of a corporate transaction:** We may share and transfer personal information if we are involved in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control by Acronis or any affiliate (in each case, whether in whole or in part). We will use our best efforts to ensure that the terms of this Privacy Statement apply to personal information after the transaction or that our customers receive advance notice of changes to personal information processing.
* **When required by law:** In certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies in accordance with judicial proceedings, court orders or legal processes. Acronis reserves the right to disclose personal information to any competent government authority when we believe disclosure is necessary, such as when Acronis suspects that data contain prohibited content or are used for illegal purposes. When reasonably possible, Acronis will provide notice of any required or requested disclosure and reasonably cooperate to limit such disclosure to the extent allowed by law.

9\. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information
---------------------------------------------------

In some jurisdictions, processing of personal information requires a legal basis. The legal bases on which Acronis relies for its lawful processing of personal information vary depending on the context in which the personal information is processed, the purpose for the processing and applicable law.

The different legal bases on which Acronis relies are:

* **Performance of the contract between Acronis and a user or Customer.** We rely on this legal basis to process contact and payment details, to permit access to the Acronis Services, to provide customer support, to manage a Customer Agreement; to perform our obligations or exercise our rights or to manage our contractual relationship with you.
* **Processing is in our legitimate business interests.** We also process personal information when the processing is in the legitimate interests of Acronis or a third party and not overridden by privacy or other fundamental rights and freedoms. Legitimate interests include conducting and organizing our business operation, such as marketing of the Acronis Services (if permitted by applicable laws) and other Acronis products, protecting Acronis’ legal interests, securing Acronis’ IT platform or addressing the requirements of Customers and users. For example, we may process personal information to understand your use of the Sites and to improve them; to authorize and manages access to certain Acronis Services; to respond to queries; to combine contact information together with information about an event you attended or content you accessed to enhance our marketing and business intelligence; to customize our interactions with you; to promote the Acronis Services and other Acronis products; and to operate, maintain and secure the Acronis Services for users and Customers. We also may have other legitimate interests and, if appropriate, we will make them clear at the relevant time.
* **Processing based on consent.** We may ask for consent to process personal information for certain reasons, such as for direct marketing. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at [data-protection-office@acronis.com](mailto:data-protection-office@acronis.com) or by navigating through the particular Settings menu, e.g., by clicking our “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of promotional emails. Withdrawing consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
* **Processing for a legal obligation.** In some cases, Acronis processes personal information based on a legal obligation. For example, Acronis must process personal information to comply with a court order or subpoena or applicable anti-money laundering laws may require Acronis or its agent to collect and report certain information. Acronis will notify you when providing your personal information is mandatory and inform you on the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis for Acronis’ processing of personal information, please contact [data-protection-office@acronis.com](mailto:data-protection-office@acronis.com).

10\. Choices about Personal Information
---------------------------------------

Mobile operating systems and app platforms (e.g., Google Play, App Store) have permission settings for specific types of mobile device data and notifications, such as for geo-location services and push notifications. Your settings in your mobile device’s operating system allow you consent to or deny certain information collection and/or push notifications. Certain Mobile Apps also may have settings that allow you to change permissions and push notification settings.

You can stop all information collection from a Mobile App by uninstalling it.

11\. Links to other Websites
----------------------------

Except as specifically described in this Privacy Statement, personal information collected by a third-party website or service that you access through the Acronis Services is not governed by this Privacy Statement. Those third-party websites and services post and follow their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Statement.

The Acronis Services may include links to third-party websites and services that are not operated by us. When you click these links, you will be directed away from the Acronis Services. A link to a third-party website or service does not mean that we endorse it or the quality or accuracy of information presented on it. If you decide to visit a third-party website or service, you are subject to its privacy practices and policies, not ours. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any personal information that you provide to these other websites and services.

12\. Protection and Retention of Personal Information
-----------------------------------------------------

We take precautions intended to help protect personal information that we process. We use a variety of measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access and use. Our safeguards are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and include (as applicable) measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and a procedure for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing of personal information. For more information on what security measures Acronis applies, please check: [https://www.acronis.com/security/cloud/data-processing-terms/](https://www.acronis.com/security/cloud/data-processing-terms/).

Acronis also expects that Customers and users will use appropriate security measures to protect information. Acronis may suspend your use of all or part of the Acronis Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that information you provided to us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately at [data-protection-office@acronis.com](mailto:data-protection-office@acronis.com). If we become aware of an incident that affects the security of your personal information, we will provide you with notice as required by applicable law. When permitted by applicable law, Acronis will provide this notice to you through the email address associated with your account.

We retain personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law. In practice, this means that we delete or anonymize personal information in your account to which we have access within the thirty (30) days from your explicit request or not later than after three (3) years of continuous inactivity unless we must keep your data (or part of it) to comply with applicable law or because an issue, claim or dispute is not yet resolved. We can keep certain data, if we can’t prove inactivity, like for accounts with registered perpetual licenses which don’t require interaction with our Cloud Acronis Services.  
After you delete your account, Acronis may still keep certain information about you – if required by applicable law or if we have another lawful basis to do so, such as if you provide us consent.

13\. Children’s Privacy
-----------------------

The Acronis Services are not directed to or intended for use by minors. If we learn that we received personal information directly from a minor under age 16, we will use that personal information only to inform the minor that he/she/they cannot use the Acronis Services.

Acronis may also provide access to your Google User Data to government authorities if Acronis suspects or believes that the Google User Data contains child pornography or other prohibited content or data or that the Google User Data is being used for illegal purposes. Acronis reserves the right, consistent with data privacy and other user data protection requirements applicable to the jurisdiction where Google User Data is stored, and if mandated by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental order, to disclose Google User Data, but only to the extent required to satisfy those laws, regulations or orders.
