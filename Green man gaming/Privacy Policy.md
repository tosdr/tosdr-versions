**  
LEGAL BASES WE RELY ON**  
  
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the lawful bases we rely on for processing this information are:

1. **Your consent.**  
    We can collect and process your data with your consent in specific situations, i.e. when you tick a box to receive email newsletter. You are able to remove your consent at any time by changing your preferences. Where consent isn't provided, Google fills their data collection gaps with conversion modelling and behavioural modelling.  
    
2. **We have a contractual obligation.**  
    In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations, i.e. if you order a game from us, we’ll collect your name email address/ phone number and payment details to deliver your purchase,  
    
3. **We have a legal obligation.**  
    If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data and we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting Green Man Gaming to law enforcement.
4. **We have a legitimate interest.**  
    In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business, and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom, or interests. For example, we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalised offers. We will also send you direct marketing emails when you shop with us and do not choose to opt out - this is often called a 'soft opt in'. We also combine the shopping history of many customers to identify trends and ensure we can keep up with demand. We may contact you regarding market research. With your consent, or when you shop with us and do not choose to opt out from receiving our emails ('soft opt in') we will use your personal data, preferences, and details of your transactions to keep you informed by email, web, text and through our contact centre about relevant products and services including tailored special offers, discounts, promotions, events, competitions and so on.  
    With your consent, or when you shop with us and do not choose to opt out from receiving our emails ('soft opt in') we will use your personal data, preferences, and details of your transactions to keep you informed by email, web, text and through our contact centre about relevant products and services including tailored special offers, discounts, promotions, events, competitions and so on.  
    

### Data Use

This section explains how we may use the data we collect about you. We may use data combined from any of the sources explained in the 'Data Collection' section of this Privacy Notice. For example, we may process together information we have collected from you, your visits to our website, your Steam or Playfire gameplay history, etc., for the purposes explained in this Privacy Notice.  
  
**Services**  
  
We (and affiliates and third parties operating on our behalf in accordance with our instructions) may use your information to operate Green Man Gaming and to provide the services you have requested - for example, in order to maintain your account, process your purchases and/or complete anti-fraud checks.  
  
We may personalise the services we provide to you based on the combined data we have collected about you (for instance, we may use your IP address to display content relevant for your area or we may recommend or to help you discover new games or social media that you are entitled to play and watch using information about your past activity).  
  
**Development**  
  
We use the data we collect to understand, improve and enhance our existing products and services and your experiences using them, and to help develop new ones. For example, we may use the data to optimise user interfaces, for bug and error fixing, apps and websites.  
  
**Moderation and Safety**  
  
We cannot monitor the whole of Green Man Gaming and make no commitment to do so. However, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to monitor and record your online activity and communication throughout Green Man Gaming and to remove and/or delete any content. We may use the combined data we collect (including information such as the content of your voice, video (Twitch video posting), and text communications, the time and location of your activities, and your Green Man Gaming Online Account, registered account details and IP address) to detect breaches and enforce our Green Man Gaming [terms of service](https://www.greenmangaming.com/terms-and-conditions/#forum) and any other terms of service you have agreed to and any rules or codes of conduct applying to your use of Green Man Gaming. Enforcement action that we may take can include suspending or banning accounts and/or devices.  
  
**Legal and Compliance**  
  
We may use the combined data we collect for auditing, compliance and legal purposes (for example, making or defending claims or activities that are required by law).  
  
**Marketing and Advertising**  
  
We might target and personalise our marketing communications, purchase recommendations and adverts that we display on our and third party websites and services based on the combined data we have collected about you (e.g. to avoid displaying content you've already purchased from our store).  
  
You may notice this personalisation when you visit Green Man Gaming (via website or app), when we send you marketing communications or when you visit our and third party websites (such as social network sites) that show purchase recommendations or adverts from us (for example, you might see an advert for a game similar to one you have played recently or a product that you have recently viewed on Green Man Gaming).  
  
You can choose if you would like to receive marketing communications from us relating to Green Man Gaming and our products and services. If you later decide not to receive marketing emails from us, you can turn off marketing communications:  

1. Via Preference Centre Settings in your Green Man Gaming Account Settings area
2. By following the instructions and/or the link "unsubscribe" attached to our marketing emails

  
We will aim to process your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event, within 2 working days. Note that we will still send you important emails about your account even if you opt-out of marketing emails.  
  
If you choose not to allow us to store and access cookies that are not strictly necessary for the provision of our websites, this will also limit when we can recognise your visits to our websites and target and personalise the advertising and commercial purchase recommendations displayed on those websites. Please see the Green Man Gaming [Cookie Policy](https://www.greenmangaming.com/cookie-policy/) for more details on our use of cookies and how to control them when accessing our websites.

This data may be used and disclosed in accordance with our and the privacy notice of the company providing the ad serving technologies. The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy notices.  
  
**Third-Party Research Companies**  
  
We may share, on a commercial basis, anonymised customer data with third-party research companies when you browse/login/purchase on Green Man Gaming (for example, making a purchase on our store). In order to comply with various privacy laws (CCPA, Nevada Privacy laws, GDPR, etc), you have the right to withdraw permission for Green Man Gaming to share any data (even anonymised) with third-party research companies for commercial reasons. To opt-out of data sharing for commercial activities please [click here](https://greenmangaming.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000065492) and log-in to your account and send us a message with your details.  
  
**Other Users**

Please be aware that anyone who can see your information will be able to share it with others, for example by sharing a gameplay video that you feature in. Some devices allow users to record, stream and upload online activities such as gameplay and therefore may be distributed outside Green Man Gaming without your knowledge, which means that you and we have no control over it.  
  
You are responsible for any content you share on forums, communities, chat and messaging features and this content will be accessible to others.  
  
We recommend you consider carefully with whom you share your information. Avoid sharing your contact information with others.

**International Transfers**  
  
Your information may be processed, stored, and transferred outside your country of residence, beyond the European Economic Area (EEA), and the UK, where we are located for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, such as the United States. Data protection laws in these countries may not offer the same level of protection as in your country, the UK, or the EEA, and you may have fewer legal rights in relation to your information. We ensure there are adequate safeguards in place when transferring your data outside your country, the UK, and the EEA, including by relying on the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, new EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC), International Data Transfer Addendum (UK GDPR Addendum), or other lawful mechanisms or otherwise that the transfer only occurs where permitted by applicable law.
