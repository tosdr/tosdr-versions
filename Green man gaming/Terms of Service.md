We have no way of telling if statements made by other users are true. This is a decision that can only be made by you. You should therefore exercise some degree of caution when using any website.

PLEASE TAKE PARTICULAR CARE IN RELATION TO THE DISCLOSURE OF YOUR OWN PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS YOUR SURNAME, ADDRESS, EMAIL ADDRESS, TELEPHONE NUMBER AND PLACES YOU GO.  
  
You acknowledge and agree that, if necessary, we will communicate with you via the email address you have provided to us.

All emails or other communications sent by us and attachments thereto are intended for the addressee only.

We do not warrant that the operation of the Service will be uninterrupted or error free.

### 8\. PURCHASES

You may purchase Games, and Gift Cards (together, the “Products”) through the Service as follows:  
  

* Our shopping pages will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order for a Product (“Order”) with us.  Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us. Please take the time to read and check your Order at each stage of the order process.
* When you place an Order this will be deemed an offer by you to buy the Product(s) for the price stated, subject to these terms and conditions.
* After you have submitted your Order GMGL will send you an e-mail to confirm that it has received it.  This email confirmation will be produced automatically so that you have confirmation of your Order details. The fact that you receive an automatic confirmation does not mean GMGL has accepted your Order or that it will be able to meet your Order.
* Where you have incorrectly submitted an Order, please contact us as soon as reasonably possible at [helpdesk@greenmangaming.com](mailto:helpdesk@greenmangaming.com).

  
If the payment confirmation for a purchase is delayed (ie payments with Boacompra, Unionpay, Alipay) the order will be fulfilled with a version of the game as advertised at the point of payment confirmation.  
  

* Once GMGL has sent the confirmation email GMGL will (if the Product is available) either: (i) make the Game available (either for download by you or otherwise); (ii) credit your user account or the user account specified by you with the value of a Gift Card; or (iii) send, or make available for you to send, the relevant Gift Card to the individual of your choosing, electronically or otherwise as described to you when placing your Order (please note that the ultimate recipient of a Gift Card will need to register for an account with GMGL in order to redeem it); and a binding contract will exist between you and us in respect of your Order once any of the foregoing events occur.
* If GMGL are unable to supply you with a Product for any reason we will inform you of this by email or otherwise through the Service, and we will not process your Order.  If you have already paid for the Product(s), GMGL will refund you the full amount, including any delivery costs charged, as soon as possible. 

  
The use and purchase of all Games purchased or downloaded through the Service shall be subject to the Game EULA (see Section 24 below), which shall be deemed incorporated into any purchase, and by purchasing or downloading or using any Game you are deemed to accept that Game EULA.  
  
ATTEMPTED PURCHASES OR DOWNLOADS VIA THE SERVICE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND MAY NOT WORK AT ALL IF YOU ARE USING A VPN (“VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK”), A PROXY SERVER OR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY. ANY SUCH PURCHASES MAY NONETHELESS BE CHARGED AS PART OF THE ORDER PROCESS. IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU, PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL OR CHANGE YOUR MIND.

### 9\. PRICE AND PAYMENT

* Payment is due from the moment an Order is accepted.
* Payment may be made as set out on the payment page of the Service, by credit card, debit card or any other such method as GMGL may introduce in its sole discretion.
* GMGL aims to debit money from your account within three (3) working days after receiving your Order.

If you do not hold an account in the relevant currency you should pay by debit or credit card (or any other method that GMGL may introduce from time to time) and your card company should exchange the amount charged to the currency of your country at the current rate. Please note that you are responsible for paying any currency exchange, or other payment charges.  
  
You will not be charged for any Orders that cannot be fulfilled and, where appropriate, GMGL will re-credit to your account any sum debited by GMGL. GMGL cannot guarantee that a particular Product will always be available.  
  
Credit/debit card details will be encrypted to minimise the possibility of someone being able to read them as they are sent over the Internet. Please refer to the Service [Privacy Policy](https://www.greenmangaming.com/privacy-notice/) regarding use of your data (including credit card data) in section 20 below.  
  
Your credit card company may also do security checks to confirm it is you making the Order.

### 10\. YOUR RIGHTS TO END THE CONTRACT

Your rights when you end the contract will depend on what you have bought, whether there is anything wrong with it, how we are performing, and when you decide to end the contract:  
  

* If what you have bought is faulty or misdescribed you may have a legal right to end the contract (or to get the product repaired or replaced or to get some or all of your money back) – see ‘If There Is A Problem with the Product’ in Section 12 below.
* If you have just changed your mind about the product, you may be able to get a refund if you are within the cancellation period.  For digital content, including Games and/or Gift Cards, the cancellation period ends at the end of 14 days after the day on which the contract between you and us is entered into. HOWEVER, IF WE SUPPLY THE PRODUCT TO YOU IMMEDIATELY AND YOU AGREED TO THIS WHEN PLACING YOUR ORDER YOU WILL NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.  Where you do not give your express consent to waive this statutory cancellation period we may not supply the Product(s) until the 14 day period has ended.
* Ending the contract because of something we have done or are going to do. If you are ending a contract for a reason set out below the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any Products which have not been provided or downloaded by you and you may also be entitled to compensation.  The reasons are:
