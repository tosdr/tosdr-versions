These terms of use form our legally binding agreement with you in relation to the Service (“the Agreement”). The Agreement sets out all the conditions on which we will provide our Service to you, and applies to you whether you are visiting the web site, or have registered to be a user of the features. If you intend to become a user (“User”) you must accept these terms as part of the registration process. This Agreement should be read carefully.

**An overview of the Service**

Money Dashboard is an Account Information Service Provider (AISP). This read only Service enables you to see all your online banking accounts into one place, and analyses your account information to help you spend, save and borrow more efficiently (“the Service”). Based on such analysis, the Service may give you information relating to products or additional services provided by third party partners.

The Service is free to consumers. We create aggregated market research, from which all personal data is removed. We sell this anonymised market research to clients to create the revenue we need to run our business. We may also earn a fee or commission from our partners based upon your use of their services or products.

The Service is an aid to you in organising, managing, and identifying opportunities related to your finances. We are not authorised to provide advice under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. If you require such advice please seek advice from an authorised adviser. Our Subsidiary, Money Dashboard Financial Services Ltd may act as a credit broker to facilitate the offering of credit based third party products and services hosted by Money Dashboard Ltd. For full details of our authorisations from the Financial Conduct Authority please search the Financial Services Register no. 743264.

You warrant that you are at least 18 years old and a resident of the UK to use the Service.

**Your Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to keeping your personal data safe. Our Privacy Policy sets out the terms on which we process any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us.

**Your Use of the Service**

Your right to access and use the Service is personal to you and is not transferable by you to any other person or entity. You agree to provide us with information which is accurate, and not to misrepresent your identity or your user information. You are only entitled to access and use the service for lawful purposes.

For the purposes of this Agreement and solely to provide account aggregation to you as part of the Service, you grant us a limited power of attorney to access third party sites, retrieve and use your information with the full power and authority to do and perform each thing necessary in connection with such activities, as you could do in person. You acknowledge and agree that when we access and retrieve account information from third party sites, we act as your agent, not as the agent of, or on behalf of, the third party whose site we are accessing. You understand and agree that the Service is not sponsored or endorsed by any third parties accessible through the Service.

By submitting permission, information, data, passwords, usernames, PINs, other log-in information, materials and other content to us through the Service, you are licensing that content to us for the purpose of providing the Service and to use in accordance with our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.moneydashboard.com/privacy). By submitting this content to us, you represent that you are entitled to submit it to us to use for this purpose, without any obligation by us to pay any fees or other limitations.

**What we ask you not to do**

You agree that you will not:

1. Use any robot, spider, scraper, deep link or other similar automated data-gathering or extraction tools, programme, algorithm or methodology to access, acquire, copy or monitor the Service or any portion of it without our express written consent, which may be withheld at our sole discretion;
2. Use or attempt to use any engine, software, tool, agent, or other device or mechanism (including without limitation browsers, spiders, robots, avatars or intelligent agents) to navigate or search the Service, other than the search engines and search agents available through the Service and other than generally available third-party web browsers (such as Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari);
3. Post or transmit any file which contains viruses, worms, Trojan horses or any other contaminating or destructive features, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Service; or
4. Attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble, or reverse-engineer any of the software comprising or in any way making up a part of the Service.

**Third Party Partners**

The Service may provide website links and hosted functionality from by third parties. The use of third party products or services is governed by the terms and conditions of the relevant supplier. The content and operations of third party products and services is outside of our control, and we cannot accept responsibility or liability for the products and services provided to you by these third parties.

**Advertising**

Some parts of the Service are supported by links from advertisers that may be custom matched to you based on information stored in the Service, queries made through the Service or other information. We will not disguise any adverts in the service.

We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products or services available through the links. We do not guarantee that any loan, investment, account or other service’s terms, rates or rewards offered by any particular advertiser are actually the terms that may be offered to you if you pursue the offer, or that they are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market.

**Notifications and Alerts**

All required notices will be sent electronically to the e-mail address that you provide. Notifications will be sent to you if there is a material change to the Service, its Terms, or Policies.

The Service includes alerts on your account activity. These can be customised, deactivated or reactivated by you. These alerts allow you to choose alert messages for your accounts. We may add new alerts from time to time, or cease to provide certain alerts at any time at our discretion.

Alerts will be sent to the email address you have provided as your primary email address. You may also choose to have alerts sent to a mobile device. Alerts will include information about your accounts, such as your account balance or the due date for your credit card payment. Anyone with access to your email, or your mobile device, that is associated with the Service may be able to view the content of these alerts.

**Your User Information**

Please let us know if any of your user details change (including any Personal data), particularly your email address, mobile phone number, or address including postcode. If you do not do this, we will not be able to deliver any alerts or notifications to you, and your ability to access the service may be compromised if your details cannot be verified at the account provider.

You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username which, together with your password and or biometric ID (Face ID or fingerprint), allows you to access the Service. If you become aware of any unauthorised use of your user information, you agree to notify us immediately at [\[email protected\]](https://www.moneydashboard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

For further details about how your User Information is handled, see our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.moneydashboard.com/privacy)

**Complaints Policy**

If you wish to complain about any of the services provided by Money Dashboard, please email us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.moneydashboard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or you can write directly to the Chief Executive Officer, Money Dashboard Limited, 5th Floor, 125 Princes Street, Edinburgh, EH2 4AD, explaining the nature of the complaint and what you would like us to do to put it right.

In addition:

If your complaint is about how we store or process your personal information, you can also contact the [**Information Commissioner's Office**](https://ico.org.uk/concerns/), although we’d appreciate the chance to deal with your concern first.

If your complaint is about a financial service product (e.g. banking, insurance, mortgage, pension, savings and investments, credit card, store cards, loans, hire purchase, financial advice) that we were involved in either selling, or introducing you, and neither we, nor any other associated third party (e.g. product provider, or an intermediary) are able to satisfactorily deal with your complaint within 8 weeks of you raising it, you may complain to the [**Financial Ombudsman Service**](http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/). The Money Dashboard complaints process can be found here.
