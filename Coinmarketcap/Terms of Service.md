Our performance under these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms limits our right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of the Service or information provided to, or gathered by, us with respect to such use. To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to your access or use of this Service within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.

    6. If any provision of these Terms, including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth above, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalid or unenforceable provisions in these Terms shall be deemed superseded by valid and enforceable provisions that, to the extent possible, fulfil the business purposes and intent of such invalid and unenforceable provisions.
    7. In addition to and without limiting the preceding paragraph, some jurisdictions may provide rights in addition to those provided in the above "Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability" section or do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or liability for incidental or consequential damages. Therefore, the limitations set forth in the above Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability section may not apply to you in whole or in part or there may be state or country specific provisions that supersede such limitations in whole or in part.

All views, opinions, positions and representations made to you as part of the Virtual Event (including but not limited to those made by sponsors, attendees, speakers, presenters and other Registered Participants) are theirs alone and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions and positions of CMC. CMC makes no such representation to you in this regard.
20. CMC also makes no warranties to you in respect of any and all aspects of the Virtual Events (including but not limited to the accuracy, reliability, suitability or completeness of any and all contents and materials presented and made available to you as part of your participation in the Virtual Events).

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY & INDEMNIFICATION
-----------------------------------------

22. In no event shall CMC (and its respective officers, directors, employees, members, agents, and affiliates) be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, or consequential damages or damages for lost profits, arising out of, or in any way connected with, your access to or participation in the Virtual Event, including but not limited to damages relating to: (i) any change to the Virtual Event date, (ii) inability to access, display, or view the streaming of the Virtual Event due to technical issues or otherwise; or (iii) otherwise arising out of the access to or participation in the Virtual Event, whether based on a theory of negligence, contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, and even if CMC has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
23. In no event shall CMC (and its respective officers, directors, employees, members, agents, and affiliates) be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in excess of US$100.00.

The limitations specified in this clause will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these VE Terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
24. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. These terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
25. Except to the extent prohibited under applicable law, you shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless CMC and its members, managers, directors, officers, employees, partners, consultants, contractors, service providers, agents, affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all suits, actions, proceedings and claims by third parties (whether threatened or actual), and all losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of, relating to or in connection with: (i) your participation in the Virtual Event, and use (or misuse) of contents obtained through such participation; (ii) your violation of any of these VE Terms; (iii) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (iv) any claim that your actions and/or conduct had caused damage to, infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated the rights of any third party, including infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, or violation of any right of privacy or publicity; and/or (v) any dispute that you have with any third party relating to or in connection with your participation in the Virtual Event. CMC reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with CMC in asserting any available defenses and in the conduct of such defense.
26. For clarity, the rights and protections afforded to CMC under these VE Terms shall be in addition to the rights and protections that CMC is entitled to under the CMC Terms of Use and CMC Privacy Policy.

CAMPAIGN TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-----------------------------

By entering or participating in a campaign (the “Campaign”) organized by CMC or posted on CMC’s website, including but not limited to the airdrop campaign and Learn and Earn campaign, each participant agrees to comply with and be bound by (i) these terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”), (ii) the general Terms of Use, and (iii) the decisions of the relevant CMC entity (“CMC”), which are final and binding in all respects, and (iii) any applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.

Entries submitted by persons who do not meet the eligibility requirements are void.
    
2. How To Enter

The use of any scripts, computer programs, robotic repetitive, macro, automatic, programmed or similar automated entry methods or agents to submit entries will void all entries submitted by that person or that person’s agents. All entries submitted in compliance with these Terms and Conditions and not disqualified or void are considered “Eligible Entries.” However, just because a participant makes an Eligible Entry does not mean he/she will be awarded the Prize (please see Section 4 below).
    
3. Winner Selection and Notification
    ---------------------------------
    
    The winner or winners (each a “Winner”) of the Campaign will be determined according to CMC at CMC’s sole and exclusive discretion. The decisions of the CMC will be final on all matters relating to the judging. CMC expressly reserves the right to delay the announcement of the Winner for any reason it deems necessary.

If the Winner cannot be reached after a reasonable effort has been exerted and/or fails to respond to confirm his/her email address within one (1) day (or such other time specified by CMC) from when the initial notification email is sent, the Winner forfeits the Prize.
    
4. Winner Verification

If the Winner does not complete all forms necessary within the time given and/or in the event of non-compliance by the Winner, such Winner shall be disqualified and shall forfeit the Prize and all privileges that may otherwise be due to a Winner shall be terminated.
    
    Provided that the Winner is in compliance with the Terms and Conditions and after having successfully proven eligibility, the Winner will be officially confirmed as the Winner.
    
5. Prize
    -----
    
    Campaign prizes will be as specified by CMC in the Campaign Materials (the “Prize”).
    
    If for any reason the Prizes, or any part of a Prize, is unavailable or a Prize or related event is delayed, cancelled or postponed, or for any other reason, CMC reserves the right to modify the Campaign in its sole discretion and award a substitute prize, or portion of a prize, of comparable or greater value as set forth in these Terms and Conditions, as determined by CMC in its sole discretion.
    
    No substitution, transfer, assignment or cash equivalent of the Prize, or any portion thereof, is permitted by the Winner (as defined below).

    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

CMC assumes no responsibility for any typographical or other error in the printing of the offer or administration of the Campaign, errors in processing entries, identifying the Winner, in the announcement of the Prize and Winner, the delivery of the Prize, any problems or technical malfunction of any telephone network or lines, computer systems, online systems, servers or providers, computer equipment, software, failure of any e-mail on account of technical problems or traffic congestion on the internet or on any website including CMC.com, or any combination thereof, including, without limitation, any injury or damage to Participant’s or any other person’s computer system/software related to or resulting from participation in, or uploading any materials or downloading any materials related to, the Campaign.

DIAMOND REWARDS PROGRAMME TERMS AND CONDITIONS
----------------------------------------------

By signing up for an account with CMC, you will automatically be entitled to accumulating Diamond Rewards (the “**Diamonds**”) under our Diamond Rewards Programme.

You may accumulate Diamonds from qualifying tasks and transactions which will be shown [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/account/my-diamonds/) or by such other methods which will be provided for by us from time to time. We may, at our sole and absolute discretion, increase or decrease the Diamonds to be awarded for each qualifying transaction or task as may be notified to you from time to time. You shall not be entitled to request from us any explanation pertaining to the calculation methods (for crediting the Diamonds) or other matters relating to the Diamonds or discounts for whatsoever purposes. The use of means that are improper, corrupted, false, lost, late, misdirected, deceptive or otherwise not in compliance with these terms and conditions to accumulate Diamonds, including the use of any application programming interfaces and scripts, are strictly prohibited. CMC reserves the right to refuse to grant any Diamonds or rewards to any users found to be utilizing such means to accumulate Diamonds at CMC’s sole and absolute discretion. CMC shall not be liable to any user for such refusal.

Diamonds are non-transferable and shall be for personal use of the user of the account only.

You may check your Diamonds balance and redemptions made in your account. Your Diamonds balance and redemptions as set out in your account shall serve as conclusive evidence of the same.

Diamonds have no cash or monetary value and are not redeemable for fiat or cryptocurrency in any form. They cannot be purchased, resold or transferred, for value or otherwise, under any circumstances. Diamonds shall not be regarded, construed, or used as valuable or exchangeable instruments under any circumstances.

As an account holder, you will gain access to e-vouchers, promotions, discounts, free gifts, promotion codes and other benefits offered by CMC and/or selected third-party merchants as shown on the rewards catalogue that is made available from time to time in the CMC website (“**Rewards**”). You may use your Diamonds to redeem the Rewards.

If you comply with all these Terms of Use and have the required number of Diamonds, you may select and redeem applicable Rewards via our website. Your redemption of a Reward is subject to the additional terms and conditions of CMC or the third-party merchant (as the case may be) that offers the particular Reward that you wish to redeem. In the event you do not comply with any of the terms and conditions, CMC shall not be held liable for any losses you may incur.

Upon redemption of the Rewards, reversal of the conversion of Rewards back to Diamonds is not possible. Diamonds that you have successfully redeemed for a Reward cannot be exchangeable for another Reward under any circumstances. No requests for exchange of Rewards will be entertained.

You must use your Rewards redeemed during their applicable validity period indicated by CMC or the third party merchant. There shall be no extension of time for the validity period of any Reward redemption dates. You agree that you will have no claim whatsoever against the Company for any expired Rewards.

The Company may at its sole and absolute discretion and without prior notice to you, reject your request to redeem Rewards for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, where

1. There are insufficient Diamonds to redeem for the particular Reward;
2. The Reward is no longer made available or out-of-stock by the third party merchant;
3. The Diamonds you wish to use for redemption of Rewards have been issued to you in error; or
4. The Company reasonably believes that that redemption transaction may be suspicious, illegal, involves any criminal activity or involves points that have been obtained through dishonest or fraudulent means or abusive behaviour.

Fraud, abuse of redemptions or any dishonest activities may result in the forfeiture of accumulated Diamonds or termination of your account.

To the extent as permitted by applicable law, the Company reserves the right at any time to:

1. vary, modify or amend the terms and conditions of the Diamond Rewards Programme;
2. terminate or modify the Diamond Rewards Programme;
3. revoke, adjust and/or recalculate any Diamonds awarded; change the number of Diamonds required for redemption of specific Rewards or substitute any Reward with another of a similar value;
4. change the number of Diamonds required for redemption of specific Rewards or substitute any Reward with another of a similar value;
5. change the number of Diamonds that can be earned on spendings on qualifying transportation services;
6. modify the qualifications and eligibility for earning Diamonds;
7. modify the activities that earn Diamonds;
8. modify the methods used to calculate the number of Diamonds to be awarded; and/or
9. withhold or cease the awarding of Diamonds to you.

without prior notice to you and at its sole discretion.
