Summary
=======

Firstly, **in this modern age privacy should be a major concern not just for the few but for everyone**. This is why we have developed this privacy statement. Here we both explain how we collect and manage information and explore how to use the website whilst maintaining your privacy. We think this second point is important because we want our customers to have a good experience visiting our website but also to be aware of what information may be being used to understand who our customers are whilst maintaining a healthy distance between knowing enough from knowing too much.

We would prefer to not use any tracking or measurement other than the communication we receive from people. However we have to compete on the world stage of commerce. And to do that we have to gain a better insight of where are customers are coming from without knowing anything about them that is not absolutely vital. That second part is really important. We do not wish to know anything more than what country someone is from, what pages they are interested in and how they found us. Much like when someone comes to our stand at an exhibition. What was it you were interested in that you wanted to find out more about us. Unfortunately the service provides that we need to use want to know way too much information about our visitors and customers – surely that’s not fair or right unless visitors provide informed consent? Informed consent is difficult to protect. It shouldn’t be. It should be an essential part of business practice. Visitors and customers should know and understand what information they are providing and how it will be used. And if they do not wish to give it there needs to be an options to make sure the user has control. At the end of the day, we provide a service and you pay us money. This website provides you with information about the product and service and you then decide if you are interested in it. We are not here to covertly collect and maintain information to sell it as an information broker. Therefore we recommend you take a look at this notice and also take time to consider using the following services to help protect your privacy:

1.**Operating System** – make sure you know how your computer is collecting data about you. For example, Microsoft Windows will collect information about. You can control this by going to the Privacy settings  

2\. **Web browser** – make sure you know how your data is being protected with the choice of web browser. Chrome will collect a wide range of information about you. There are different versions of Chrome. It is based on the open source version called Chromium. This is what Microsoft Edge is based on. But if you want good privacy practice, use the Chromium verion or another browser that has clear privacy policies such as DuckDuck go for mobile, Mozilla Firefox for desktop and mobile, Opera, Vivaldi or if you use Linux there are a multiude of browsers available that a privacy conscious.  

3\. **Browser Plugins** – make good use of the fantastic plugins for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com "Mozilla Firefox") and to make Chrome and Edge more secure and privacy focused we would reccomend using EFF’s [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/ "Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Badger"), [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/ "Ghostery Privacy Plugin"), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/ "Duck Duck Go Privacy Search") plugins. Also be aware of open source projects such as [ToSDR](https://www.tosdr.org/ "Terms of Service Didn't Read") (Terms of Services Didn’t Read)

4\. **Facebook Container** – Facebook has poor privacy practice as you may know from the range of news stories around the world. In response to this Mozilla developed [Facebook Container](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/facebookcontainer/ "Facebook Container Plugin for Mozilla"), a plugin that stops Facebook from tracking people outside of Facebook. More information about this tool is available from Mozilla.

### Concerns over Facebook and the reality of doing Online Business

Our website does use analytics. However, we do not live by analytics. The most important thing we use is feedback from customers! We like to hear from you and you can connect with us through our website. We have had to come to terms with the fact that people use social media platforms now more than websites. We think that this will hopefully change in the future. For the present however, we have had to be visible in such platforms such as Facebook. It is great to be able to see people come to us and talk to use through the platform but we urge caution. Make sure you know that your privacy is safe and be careful using any online platform.

When you use this website you know are aware of what data is used and that this website is now connected to Facebook. This is why we want to make you aware that if your are concerned about your privacy, there are systems available to help protect it and we encourage you to use them. If you are not concerned about your online privacy or you just want to know more, we suggest visiting:

* [The UK Data Protection Act](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection) (We are based in the UK therefore governed by British Law)
* [The Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/)
* [EFF](https://www.eff.org/)
* [Family Friendly](https://www.famfriendly.com/)
* [The European Union Priavacy Information Reference](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/internet-telecoms/data-protection-online-privacy/index_en.htm)

There are many more services and tools that can keep you and your family safe. We hope you find this informative and that it helps to improve your online privacy and security.

We may process your personal data for the purposes of our own legitimate interests provided that those interests do not override any of your own interests, rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data.

### Your duty to inform us of changes

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Should your personal information change, please notify us of any changes of which we need to be made aware by contacting us, using the contact details below.

Your rights in connection with personal data

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

* Request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive details of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are processing it lawfully.
* Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
* Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
* Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this basis. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
* Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
* Request the transfer of your personal data to you or another data controller if the processing is based on consent, carried out by automated means and this is technically feasible.

If you want to exercise any of the above rights, please email our data protection point of contact info@bluedonutstudios.com.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

What rights you have over your website data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

Your right to withdraw consent
------------------------------

In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal data for a specific purpose (for example, in relation to direct marketing that you have indicated you would like to receive from us) you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please email our data protection point of contact at info@bluedonutstudios.com.

Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your personal information (personal data) for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.
