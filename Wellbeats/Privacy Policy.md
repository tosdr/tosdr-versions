LifeSpeak Inc. (“LifeSpeak”, “we”, “us”, “our”, including all LifeSpeak Entities, as defined below), are committed to protecting and using your Personal Information (as defined below) responsibly. We are guided and governed by applicable federal, provincial, and state privacy legislation.

This privacy policy describes how LifeSpeak collects, uses, and discloses your Personal Information.

**Summary**

* **Sharing your Personal Information with your Employer/Sponsor**:

_In_ _limited cases, we share certain Personal Information with your employer/sponsor, such as for the purpose of verifying whether you are eligible for an incentive payment, and only when necessary.

This privacy notice should also be read alongside our Cookie Policy that can be found on all our corporate and product web sites. The Cookie Policies describe how we use cookies to collect information and run our websites.

**Personal Information**

In this privacy policy, “Personal Information” refers to information that identifies you as an individual alone or in combination with other data and is provided to or collected by us. Personal Information includes, for example:

* **Personal identifiers and contact information**, such as your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. It also includes other identifiers necessary to conduct “know your client” activities (for example, information about named beneficiaries and/or spouses and partners).
* **Information about your dependent(s)**, like their name(s) and date(s) of birth.
* **Health information** that you choose to provide to us when completing a member profile or assessment or similar forms. This information is not required to use our products but will assist us in providing you with a better, more tailored experience.
* **Demographic data** that you or your sponsor choose to share with us.
* **Internet or other electronic network activity information**, such as browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, and pages viewed on our site.

**Collecting personal information**

We may collect your personal information

* From professionals who use our products and services to deliver our services to you;
* In limited cases, from your employer;
* In limited cases, from third-party sources, like certain cookies.

Professional(s) may record Personal Information in our systems, such as their interactions with you, their evaluations, records and notes and other information related to your health and/or health care.

LifeSpeak stores Canadian user data on servers located in Canada, and United States user data on servers located in the United States. The data belonging to users outside the United States and Canada is stored on servers located in either the United States or Canada, depending where their employer/sponsor is based. The data of users of the LIFT session Entity product is stored on servers in the United States.

**Using personal information**

We use your Personal Information to:

* Deliver our products and services to you, including customer support and to deliver personalized class and program recommendations;

* De-identify and/or anonymize your Personal Information;
* Understand how you access and utilize features and services on our Websites and in our Apps in order to troubleshoot, enhance, improve and optimize our products and services;
* Carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts (including our Terms of Service), with you or to comply with our legal obligations;
* Screen for potential patterns of misuse and/or fraudulent use of our systems;
* Estimate our audience size and usage patterns and analyze trends and track movements around our Websites and our systems;
* Gather demographic information about the users of our Websites and our systems;
* Assess the performance of our staff for continuing quality improvement;
* Fulfill any other purpose with your consent.

Please note that we may also use your personal information for research and development purposes, in which case the information is de-identified and aggregated, meaning it does not personally identify you. We may also share de-identified or anonymized data with your employer/sponsor.

**Sharing Personal Information**

LifeSpeak may disclose your Personal Information for purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable law. LifeSpeak may also disclose your Personal Information to:

* Carry out our obligations;

* Respond to cease and desist letters, legal proceedings, criminal and civil subpoenas, and any court orders;
* Comply with our legal obligations;
* Pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or
* Fulfill any other lawful purpose, with your consent.

If you are using our Service through a third party or employer that contracts with us to provide Service to you, we may also share aggregate information with that third party or employer.  We will only share your identifiable data with your employer when your employer offers you incentives for participation, and we will never share any identifiable at all where your activity is within the ALAViDA Substance Use Management Entity.  The information shared with your employer is limited to the amount of data needed in order for your employer to pay you the incentive you have earned.

**LifeSpeak Employees and Service Providers**

In providing products and services to you, LifeSpeak may be required to share Personal Information with its employees. **‍**All LifeSpeak staff are required to keep user Personal Information private and confidential.

LifeSpeak may transfer Personal Information to our service providers, agents, vendors or other organizations that provide services to us, for the purposes set out in this policy. These include delivering communications and or products to you, storing your data and similar types of other data processing.

Our service providers are given only the information necessary to perform the required service and are subject to regulatory requirements imposing data security obligations on the ways in which they process Personal Information. Specifically, we require our service providers and data processors to have appropriate security procedures and controls in place to protect Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy and the security practices and regulations applicable in their country of jurisdiction.

**For Quebec residents**: Please note that your information may be transferred outside of Quebec.

**LifeSpeak may also share your Personal Information** **where we believe, upon reasonable grounds, that it is necessary to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of an identifiable person or group, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection.** This includes disclosing your Personal Information if necessary to protect against a clear and imminent risk of serious harm to any individual. For example, LifeSpeak may share your Personal Information if:

1. You appear to be impaired as the result of alcohol or drugs, and then attempt to operate a motor vehicle, go to a safety-sensitive job, or take any other action in which such impairment could put yourself or others at risk of significant harm. In such cases, we may also warn law enforcement authorities and/or your employer or professional regulator, that you may be at risk of putting yourself and/or others in danger.
2. LifeSpeak believes that you are at imminent risk of suicide;
3. LifeSpeak believes that you are at risk of committing homicide.
4. Disclosure is necessary to protect an identifiable child, consistent with applicable law.
5. Disclosure is necessary to protect a vulnerable adult who by virtue of condition or circumstance is unable to seek support or assistance for abuse or neglect, consistent with applicable law.

**Consent**

When you use our services or visit our Websites, you consent to us collecting, using, and disclosing your Personal Information in accordance with this privacy policy. In some cases, your consent may be “implied” (i.e., your permission is assumed based on your action or inaction at the point of collection, use or sharing of your Personal Information).

We will generally obtain consent when we want to use or disclose your Personal Information for a new purpose or for purposes other than those stated at the time of collection. You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.

**Protecting Personal Information**

Your Personal Information is protected by reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards that are commensurate with the sensitivity and volume of the information that we collect, use, and disclose. These include:

* Restricting access to Your Personal Information to a limited number of people;
* Encryption;
* Multi-factor authentication;
* Logging and monitoring software.

Please note no computer system is perfectly secure and our security measures can only serve to help minimize risk to your Personal Information.

**Retention of Personal Information**

 Personal information will be retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, except where otherwise required or permitted by law. Once no longer required, your Personal Information will be securely destroyed or anonymized (so the information no longer identifies you).

**‍Your Privacy Rights**

* **Access and rectification:** With some limited exceptions, you have the right to access and update Personal Information held by LifeSpeak. You may also request that LifeSpeak correct Personal Information that LifeSpeak holds.
* **For Quebec residents:** You may request an explanation of a decision rendered exclusively via the automated processing of your Personal Information (where applicable). You may also request that your Personal Information be provided to you in a structured, commonly used technological format.

If we provide subscription-based services, such as email newsletters, we will allow you to make choices about what information you provide at the point of information collection or at any time after you have received a communication from us while you are subscribed.  Transactional or service-oriented messages, such as delivery confirmation messages, are usually excluded from such preferences, as such messages are required to respond to your requests or to provide goods and services and are not intended for the purposes of marketing.

From time to time, we may send you email communications that your sponsor wants us to send to you.  You may opt out of them at any time by selecting the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email.  Please note that by opting out or unsubscribing you may affect other services you have requested we provide to you, in which email communication is a requirement of the service provided.
