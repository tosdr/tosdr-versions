Everybody earns with Noixion!
-----------------------------

All users can earn cryptocurrencies (TRON and NXN) from the very moment they begin using Noixion: content creators, storage network owners… but also the end-users who view the content.

Noixion TV can be seen as a decentralized alternative to YouTube that uses Blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies. Besides, ALL users can earn money easily on Noixion’s transparent platform.

Decentralized Storage and Contend Delivery Network
--------------------------------------------------

NOIXION users are free to choose between a centralized or a DECENTRALIZED storage system. You can also choose using your own servers (and monetize for their use) or third-party ones.

Noixion storage servers or nodes become part of a decentralized content distribution network (CDN), so that media content is cached on different servers. In each case, the server that is closest to the end user is selected, thus increasing the efficiency and quality of the platform.

There are different storage alternatives that users can choose from:

Smart Contracts compatibles with TRX and NXN are used to execute transactions on the platform, offering total traceability and transparency to the users.

* Kademlia (own implementation by Noixion)
    
* Bittorrent File System (BTFS)
    
* InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
    
* Amazon S3
    
* Google Cloud Storage
    

TRON Network Smart Contracts and TRX
------------------------------------

Smart Contracts compatibles with TRX and NXN are used to execute transactions on the platform, offering total traceability and transparency to the users.

There are also 2 additional contracts: a dividends contract (as in Wink) and a specific contract for the storage networks.

Other features & advantages
---------------------------

Noixion TV implements its own affiliate system: if you recommend Noixion to other users (by sharing your referral link) you will earn a percentage of their earnings. This way you can earn TRX or NXN for free!

As an alternative to YouTube, Noixion TV allows to broadcast content without censorship and it is not affected by the recent problems of video monetization caused by the COPPA law.

Noixion TV is already a decentralized alternative to Twitch (streaming) too. Very soon we will also be a real alternative to Netflix or TikToK.

Why did we create Noixion TV?
-----------------------------

Do you know Justin Sun? Well, we share his vision: we “just” seek the decentralization of the Internet, fairer profit sharing and monetization, and less control (and yes, less censorship) by the “usual suspects”. And that’s why we use the TRON network.

Another of our main objectives is to bring user experience to the next level, making it simple and fast for Blockchain experts and novices alike. We believe that building a universal user experience is the key to bringing cryptocurrencies and TRX to mass adoption among the general public. #MassAdoption!!!
