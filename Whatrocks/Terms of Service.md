**Terms of Use**

**In English** - [En Français](https://www.whatrocks.co/fr/conditions-generales-dutilisation)

_As of June 8, 2021_

WhatRocks Inc. and its subsidiaries and related entities (“**WhatRocks**”, “**we**”, or “**us**”) build and manage the WhatRocks service (“**Service**”) as defined below on behalf and in the name of WhatRocks Foundation, the overarching non-profit organization that governs the WhatRocks service. This Service brings together registered members (“**Members**”, “**Users**”) that include engaged, purpose-driven individuals (“**Individual**”, “**Individuals**”), corporations including but not limited to advertisers, online publishers, and event organizers (“**Corporation**”, “**Corporations**”), charitable non-profit organizations and social enterprises (“**Charity**”, “**Charities**”).

The WhatRocks Service endeavours to fund and accelerate social and environmental change by generating new revenue streams for Charities:

1 - Corporations reward Individuals financially with fungible blockchain tokens issued exclusively by WhatRocks and called Rocks™ (“**Digital Tokens**”) when Individuals are exposed to, engage or interact with WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material such as online banner ads, video or rich media ads, emails, websites and mobile apps (including notifications) as well as any other form of digital or print material.

2 - Individuals use their Digital Tokens to make direct donations to their Charities of choice, or to make giveback purchases of items including but not limited to goods, services, and promo codes (“**Giveback Items**”) from selling Members (“**Merchants**”). The Digital Tokens used for payment are directly donated to the beneficiary Charity nominated by the Merchant.

3 - Charities fund their activities by selling their Digital Tokens for fiat currency to Corporations that need to reward Individuals financially when they are exposed to, engage or interact with their own WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material.

As the exclusive, worldwide licensee and service provider of WhatRocks Foundation, WhatRocks is tasked with the mission of bringing to life the vision of WhatRocks Foundation and to enforce the governance of WhatRocks Foundation by ensuring that Individuals everywhere be financially empowered with the marketing or advertising spend of Corporations, so they get money to donate to the social and environmental causes they care about.

To that purpose, WhatRocks has developed a proprietary technology-based ecosystem (“**Service**”) that includes a technical platform and a suite of tools and products described below to support the development and the management of the WhatRocks Service, the delivery of WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material to Members of the WhatRocks Service as well as the processing of transactions such as financial rewards, donations and payments.

As we do need rules to keep the Service safe for you, us and the WhatRocks Service globally, these Terms of Use ("Terms"), including the **BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER CONTAINED HEREIN**, govern your access to or use of the Service and the entirety of your relationship with WhatRocks.

These Terms apply to all users of the Service (individually or collectively, "**you**", “**User**”, “**Member**”, “**Visitor**”). By signing up to use an account through WhatRocks.co, WhatRocks wallets, websites, applications and platforms, and other WhatRocks-related sites, applications, communications and services, including off-site services, such as our ad service, plugins, cookies, tags, widgets, web browser add-ons and extensions, and other software programs (collectively the "**Service**") but excluding services that state that they are offered under different terms of use, you agree that you have read, understand, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms as well as our Founding Member Agreement, our [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/privacy-policy), our [Cookie Policy](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/cookie-policy), our [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines), and our Branding and Graphic Guidelines.

If you are reviewing and agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of such entity, with the authority to legally bind such entity and do hereby legally bind such entity to these Terms.

If you choose to not accept these Terms, you cannot use the Service. In addition to reviewing these Terms, you should also read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/privacy-policy) to better comprehend how we collect and use your information, as well as our [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines).

In case these Terms may be translated in other languages, only the English version is legally binding.

**GENERAL**
-----------

### **Our role**

We believe more change happens when people with different backgrounds, perspectives and goals join forces to fund social and environmental change. The purpose of the WhatRocks Service is to bring together Individuals, Corporations, and Charities and help them raise donations pursuant to our [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines).

As a regulated financial service company, we are required to identify Corporations and Charities on the Service. This ensures we remain in compliance with KYC (“Know Your Customer”), AML (“Anti-Money Laundering”) and CTF (“Counter-Terrorism Financing”) laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, something that is necessary for us to be able to continue to offer digital the Service to all our Members. WhatRocks collects and verifies KYC and AML information about Corporations and Charities in order to: (1) protect WhatRocks and the WhatRocks Service from fraudulent users, and (2) to keep appropriate records of WhatRocks’ customers but **we do not otherwise monitor, verify, or perform any background check on Corporations, or Charities.**

We merely provide a Service to empower Individuals financially with Digital Tokens so they can donate to the Charities of their choice or buy Giveback Items. When these Digital Tokens are used to purchase Giveback Items, they are donated to the Charity of the Merchant’s choice.

### **Targeted marketing and advertising**

To enable Individuals, Corporations and Charities individually and collectively redefine the value exchange between Individuals and Corporations in a way that establishes a new social contract that generates new revenues for Charities, you understand and agree to the use of your personal data pursuant to the [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/privacy-policy) in order to target you with WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material and help you earn Digital Tokens when they are exposed to or when they engage or interact with such material.

If you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any aspect of the use of your personal data, you should immediately discontinue access or use of our Service.

### **no endorsement**

WhatRocks and WhatRocks Foundation do not endorse any Corporations and any of their products or services, or any Charities and their campaigns or causes.

The presence of the WhatRocks logo, trademarks, or taglines (“**WhatRocks Material**”) on any marketing or advertising material of Corporations merely informs Individuals that this material rewards them financially with Digital Tokens when they are exposed to, engage or interact with such material so they can make donations to the Charities of their choice. We do not review any marketing or advertising material that shows the WhatRocks Material.

Pursuant to our [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines), by no means does the membership of a Corporation to the WhatRocks Service, the presence of the WhatRocks Material on any marketing or advertising material of Corporations, or the sale of Giveback Items by any Corporation in the Service imply that WhatRocks or WhatRocks Foundation implicitly or explicitly endorses, approves, guarantees, certifies or vouches for:

* the narrative, messaging, or any photo, audio, or video content used insuch marketing or advertising material; or
    
* the accuracy of the claim asserted in such marketing or advertising material; or
    
* the products or services promoted in such marketing or advertising material; or
    
* the Giveback Items listed in the Service; or
    
* the course of action and conduct of any Corporation that uses the WhatRocks Material in such marketing or advertising material.
    

Pursuant to our [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines), by no means does the membership of a Charity to the WhatRocks Service and the ability for such Charity to raise donations in the Service imply that WhatRocks or WhatRocks Foundation implicitly or explicitly endorses, approves, guarantees, certifies or vouches for:

* the social or environmental agenda of the Charity;
    
* the course of action and conduct of the Charity;
    
* the use of proceeds by the Charity from the donations raised.
    

### **Access to the Service**

To access the Service, you must have the necessary equipment (such as a smartphone or a computer) and the associated telecommunication service subscriptions to access the Internet. Access to the Service may become degraded or unavailable during times of significant volume of traffic or transactions. This could result in the inability to buy, sell, earn, spend, or donate Digital Tokens for periods of time and may also lead to support response time delays. Although we strive to provide you with excellent service, we do not represent that the Service will be available without interruption and we do not guarantee that any order will be executed, accepted, recorded, or remain open. WhatRocks shall not be liable for any losses or damages resulting from or arising out of transaction delays. While we’re working hard to build an amazing Service for free for people everywhere, we can’t make you any promises that it will always work perfectly or that we’ll maintain all our Service forever.

### **Registration of WhatRocks account**

Users of our Service (“**Members**”) including Individuals, Corporations and Charities are required to register to the WhatRocks Service in order to open their Member account (“**WhatRocks Account**”) with the associated digital wallet for holding Digital Tokens (“**Wallet**”) and to tie all their activities on the Service to this account including but not limited to credits and debits to their Wallet, the creation of or participation in fundraisers, the post, view and sale of Giveback Items, and their engagement with personal contacts in the Service to send or respond to invitations to go to a local party or event or to participate in a in-app fundraiser. Fundraisers, Giveback Items and data on some of our Service is viewable to non-registered users (“**Visitors**”).

To become a Member, you are asked to create an account either as (1) an individual ("Personal Account”), (2) a company that operates as a for-profit organization (“Corporate Account”), or (3) a charity that operates as a non-profit organization or a social enterprise that operates as a for-profit organization with a social or environmental purpose (“Charity Account").

If, to the extent permitted by WhatRocks from time to time, you grant express permission to a third-party to access or connect to your WhatRocks Account, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third-party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under these Terms. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third-party with access to your WhatRocks Account. Further, you acknowledge and agree that you will not hold WhatRocks responsible for, and will indemnify WhatRocks from, any liability arising out of or related to any act or omission of any third-party with access to your WhatRocks Account. You may change or remove permissions granted by you to third parties with respect to your WhatRocks Account at any time through the Settings of your account.

By using a WhatRocks Account, you agree and represent that you will use WhatRocks only for yourself or on behalf of a legal entity for which you hereby represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative, with the authority to legally bind such entity and do hereby legally bind such entity to these Terms. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your WhatRocks Account.

Subject to these Terms, we grant you without charge a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exchangeable, revocable, royalty-free license to access and use the Service and related content, materials, information solely for purposes approved by WhatRocks from time to time. Any other use of the Service or Content is expressly prohibited.

This license agreement permits you to use the Service subject to certain conditions, rights and obligations set forth herein. We may, in our sole discretion and in compliance with the [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines), refuse to open a WhatRocks Account, or limit the number of WhatRocks Accounts that you may restrict, hold, suspend, remove, cancel or terminate any WhatRocks Account, or the use of Digital Tokens in your account.

### **Supported digital currencies**

Your Wallet associated with your WhatRocks Account is intended solely for proper use of Digital Tokens based on an existing blockchain, exclusively issued by WhatRocks and used in the Service. Although Digital Tokens have a fixed value, WhatRocks may change the applicable exchange rate in fiat currency from time to time to adjust to the market value of the underlying cryptocurrency. 

Your Wallet allows you to store, track, transfer, and manage your balances of Digital Tokens and shows credit and debit transactions for the Digital Tokens, and the available balance of Digital Tokens for you to use.

Unless specifically and officially announced by WhatRocks, the Service excludes all other protocols and/or functionality which supplement or interact with the Digital Tokens. This exclusion includes but is not limited to: metacoins, colored coins, side chains, or other derivative, enhanced, or forked protocols, tokens, or coins or other functionality, such as staking, protocol governance, and/or any smart contract functionality, which may supplement or interact with the Digital Tokens.

**Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Wallet to store, send, request, or receive digital currencies we do not support or to engage in any other type of transaction or functionality involving any such protocol** as WhatRocks is not configured to detect, secure, or process these transactions and functionality. Any such attempted transactions will fail. **You acknowledge and agree that supplemental protocols are excluded from the supported digital currencies and that WhatRocks has no liability for any losses related to supplemental protocols.**

You acknowledge that Digital Tokens are not subject to protections or insurance of any kind provided by the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Canadian Investor Protection Fund.

We do not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of the Digital Tokens supported by the Service. Generally, the underlying protocols are open source, and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. We assume no responsibility for the operation of the underlying protocols and we are not able to guarantee the functionality or security of network operations.

In particular, the underlying protocols may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (including “**forks**”). Any such material operating changes may materially affect the availability, value, functionality, and/or the name of the Digital Tokens you store in your Wallet. WhatRocks does not control the timing and features of these material operating changes. It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating changes and you must carefully consider publicly available information and information that may be provided by WhatRocks in determining whether to continue to use a WhatRocks Account for the affected supported digital currencies. In the event of any such operational change, WhatRocks reserves the right to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the security and safety of assets held on the Service, including temporarily suspending operations for the involved digital currency(ies), and other necessary steps; WhatRocks will use its best efforts to provide you notice of its response to any material operating change; however, such changes are outside of WhatRocks’ control and may occur without notice to WhatRocks. WhatRocks’ response to any material operating change is subject to its sole discretion and includes deciding not to support any new digital currency, fork, or other actions. **_You acknowledge and accept the risks of operating changes to digital currency protocols and agree that WhatRocks is not responsible for such operating changes and not liable for any loss of value you may experience as a result of such changes in operating rules. You acknowledge and accept that WhatRocks has sole discretion to determine its response to any operating change and that we have no responsibility to assist you with unsupported currencies or protocols._**

### **Transaction and ownership**

Transfers of (including rewards to Individuals and donations to Charities) and payments in Digital Tokens are collectively referred to herein as “**Transactions**”. Title to Digital Tokens held on your account shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to WhatRocks. As the owner of Digital Tokens in your Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Tokens. WhatRocks does not represent or treat assets in your Wallet as belonging to WhatRocks. WhatRocks does not grant any security interest in the Digital Tokens held in your Wallet.

### **primary market and secondary market**

**Primary market**

The Digital Tokens used in the Service are issued and sold exclusively by WhatRocks to Corporations on a private primary marketplace (“**Primary Market**”) in the Service and are not listed on any public cryptoassets trading platforms. To purchase Digital Tokens, Corporations place respectively buy orders on the Primary Market that WhatRocks matches by issuing the corresponding number of Digital Tokens at a fixed exchange rate.

Individuals with a Personal Account are strictly prohibited from accessing the Primary Market and from trading Digital Tokens.

**Secondary market**

The Digital Tokens are traded in the Service in a separate private secondary marketplace (“**Secondary Market**”) that is exclusively accessible to Members with a Corporate Account or a Charity Account. Charities are the exclusive resellers of already issued Digital Tokens to Corporations. To trade Digital Tokens, Corporations and Charities place respectively buy orders and sell orders of Digital Tokens on the Marketplace at a fixed exchange rate. WhatRocks does not transact on behalf of Corporations or Charities as it merely provides a Secondary Market where Corporations and Charities may trade Digital Tokens.

Individuals with a Personal Account are strictly prohibited from accessing the Secondary Market and from trading Digital Tokens.

**Trading rules**

Pursuant to the governance established by WhatRocks Foundation, buy orders from Corporations are matched in priority with one or multiple sell orders from Charities on the secondary market to allow Charities to cash out in fiat currency and fund their charitable activities. If the supply of Digital Tokens from Charities is inferior to the demand of Digital Tokens from Corporations on the secondary market, the unmet demand of Digital Tokens from Corporations is automatically directed to the primary market where WhatRocks may issue and sell the requested Digital Tokens to the complete the Corporations’ buy orders.

### **The MARKETPLACE FOR GOOD**

The Service includes a marketplace for good (“**Marketplace**”) that operates as an open platform for any Member to post and sell Giveback Items. The Digital Tokens used as payment for purchases in the Marketplace are donated directly to the Charity nominated by the Merchant.

**Selling Giveback Items**

The Marketplace enables you (“**Merchant**”) to post and sell Giveback Items that comply with the [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines) including but not limited to products, services and promo codes which may require Individuals to complete or finalize the transaction separately for free or for an additional fee, as determined by the Merchant.

As a Merchant, you shall be solely responsible for what you post and sell in the Marketplace and for keeping your Giveback Items at all times in compliance with our [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines), the intellectual property rights of others, and the applicable law. You shall also be solely responsible for such Giveback Items, including but not limited to the accuracy of the information, any participation requirements, obtaining any and all necessary authorizations, permits and waivers. You shall be solely responsible for determining (1) the nature and characteristics of your Giveback Items, (2) the eligibility, validity, and restrictions pertaining to the purchase and the use of your Giveback Items, (3) the price in Digital Tokens to be paid by Individuals for your Giveback Items, (4) if need be, the separate collection of any additional fees to complete or finalize the Individual’s purchase (including but not limited to the redemption of promo codes purchased in the Marketplace), (5) the shipping conditions, (6) the cancellation policy, and (7) the refund policy.

You may establish without charge a page in the Marketplace that provides details and information about your Giveback Item (including but not limited to the time, date, place, minimum spend, limited supply, price in Digital Tokens, and the nominated beneficiary Charity that will receive the Digital Tokens as donations) and that provides the ability to collect Digital Tokens from Individuals as payment for the Giveback Items you sell in the Marketplace.

**Terms of Sale**

All sales of Giveback Items processed in the Marketplace are final, personal, non-transferrable, non-refundable, non-cancellable, non-reversible and non-exchangeable.

The proceeds from the sale of Giveback Items to Individuals, minus any applicable blockchain fees that apply on each Transaction, are credited to the Wallet of the beneficiary Charity nominated by the Merchant. WhatRocks may change these blockchain fees from time to time to adjust to the fees charged by the underlying software protocols.

You hereby represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to post and sell the Giveback Items or to associate the Giveback Items with the Events. If you are posting and selling Giveback Items on behalf of an entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of such entity, with the authority to legally post and sell these Giveback Items and do hereby legally bind such entity to these Terms.

**You must indemnify, defend and hold harmless WhatRocks, its board members, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims (including third-party claims), demands, actions, suits, expenses (including attorney’s fees) and damages (including indirect or consequential loss) resulting in any way from any breach of these terms of sale by you or any of your employees.**

**Buying Giveback Items**

The Marketplace enables you (“**Customer**”) to view and purchase Giveback Items that comply with the [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines) including but not limited to tickets and promo codes to public events, such as concerts, festivals, exhibitions, parties, movie premieres, charity events including marathons, walks, rides, and other similar events (collectively, "**Events**") which may require participants to register separately for free or for an additional fee, as determined by the Merchant.

When you buy an event ticket from a Merchant in the Marketplace, you are registered for the associated Event: the debit transaction will show in the transaction list in your Wallet and you will receive your event ticket under the form of a single-use QR code or equivalent proof of purchase in your Wallet. You may have to finalize your registration for this Event separately on the ticketing platform of the Merchant’s choice.

When you buy a promo code for an Event from a Merchant in the Marketplace, the debit transaction will show in the transaction list in your Wallet and you will receive your promo code in your Wallet for you to redeem when you buy the event ticket with a discount on the ticketing platform of the Merchant’s choice.

All purchases of Giveback Items processed in the Marketplace are final, personal, non-transferrable, non-refundable, non-cancellable, non-reversible and non-exchangeable.

WhatRocks is not responsible for handling or communicating a Merchant’s inability to fulfill the order, order cancellation, refund policy or processing refunds, including without limitation for any errors processing a refund, the failure to provide a refund, or to communicate about a refund, or any chargebacks related to a refund. Customers should contact you concerning a refund.

In the event we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that there is uncertainty regarding the validity of the fiduciary designation, we reserve the right to require an order resolving such issue from a court of competent jurisdiction before taking any action relating to your WhatRocks Account. Pursuant to the above, the opening of a new WhatRocks Account by a designated fiduciary is mandatory following the death of a WhatRocks Account owner, and you hereby agree that your fiduciary will be required to open a new WhatRocks Account and provide the information required in these Terms in order to gain access to the contents of your WhatRocks Account.

You must obtain the written permission of WhatRocks before acting contrary to copyright law or the terms of this clause.

If you do not understand the above paragraph, WhatRocks recommends that you learn more about cryptocurrencies, blockchain tokens and wallets before using the Service.

**Wallet service**

As part of your Corporate Account, WhatRocks provides qualifying users access to: (a) a fiat currency wallet (a “**Fiat Wallet**”) and (b) a digital wallet for holding Digital Tokens (“**Wallet**”). To stay focused on improving our Service and empowering our Members to create change, WhatRocks may engage third-party service providers that are not affiliated with WhatRocks to manage your wallets. Accordingly, WhatRocks expressly disclaims responsibility and liability for all service provided by any service provider, and you agree that WhatRocks will not be responsible for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of those service.s When you create your Corporate Account, you agree to their terms and applicable fees.

You may credit your Fiat Wallet with fiat currency in view of purchasing Digital Tokens you will distribute as financial rewards to Individuals who see or click on your WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material. The purchased Digital Tokens are then credited to your Wallet for you to use as financial rewards to Individuals who are exposed to, engage or interact with your WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material. You are not allowed to sell, exchange, transfer or lend Digital Tokens.

**Account information**

You will be able to see the available balance of Digital Tokens in your Wallet as well as your Transaction history, including (1) the number of Digital Tokens purchased, (2) the applicable rate of exchange in fiat currency, (3) the corresponding amount in fiat currency, (4) a reference to the identity of your Corporation’s representative who placed each buy order of Digital Tokens, and (5) the date of each Transaction.

### **Transactions**

**Buying Digital Tokens**

Digital Tokens purchases and sales on the marketplace are collectively referred to herein as “**Trading Transactions**”.

You can load funds into your Fiat Wallet from a valid bank account via ACH transfer or wire transfer. Your fiat balance is in a pending state and will not be credited to your Fiat Wallet until after the bank transfer has cleared, usually with 5 business days. We may debit your bank account linked with your WhatRocks Account as soon as you initiate payment. The name on your linked bank account and your wire transfer must match the name verified on your Corporate Account.

When you buy Digital Tokens on the Service, you are buying from WhatRocks on the primary market or from Charities on the secondary market. WhatRocks provides the blockchain infrastructure to facilitate that purchase between you, WhatRocks and Charities. WhatRocks does not act as the agent that transacts on your behalf.

You may buy Digital Tokens using (a) funds in your Fiat Wallet, or (b) a valid bank account in the name that matches the name on your Corporate Account (each a "**Valid Payment Method**"). Your purchase must follow the relevant instructions in the Service. A purchase of Digital Tokens using a Valid Payment Method generally will initiate on the business day we receive your instructions. Purchased Digital Tokens will be deposited in your Wallet as soon as funds have settled to WhatRocks or the Charities, which in the case of a bank account may take up to five business days.

Your buy orders of Digital Tokens are pending on the marketplace until the corresponding amount in fiat currency is credited to your Fiat Wallet. Although Digital Tokens have a fixed value, WhatRocks may change the applicable exchange rate in fiat currency from time to time to adjust to the market value of the underlying cryptocurrency. Once your payment in fiat currency is received on your Fiat Wallet, your buy orders are then placed on the Marketplace to be matched in priority with sell orders from Charities on the secondary market. You cannot withdraw or cancel buy orders that are placed in the Marketplace: buy orders are non-cancellable, non-exchangeable, non-refundable, non-transferable, irrevocable, and non-reversible. Once your payment in fiat currency is received on the Charities’ Fiat Wallet, their Digital Tokens are transferred to your Corporation’s Wallet.

Should the supply of Digital Tokens represented by the sell orders available on the secondary market be insufficient to meet your demand of Digital Tokens, your unmet demand of Digital Tokens is automatically directed to the primary market where WhatRocks may issue and sell the requested Digital Tokens to the complete your buy order. Your buy order will therefore always find a counterparty for your Trading Transaction, regardless of your order size.

When a Trading Transaction occurs using your credentials, we will assume in good faith that you authorized such Trading Transaction. It is important that you regularly check your Fiat Wallet and Wallet balances and your Trading Transaction history regularly. We are not responsible for any claim for unauthorized or incorrect Trading Transactions. You are fully and solely responsible for all purchases of Digital Tokens that occur under your WhatRocks Account.

If your Trading Transaction cannot be completed for any reason (such as price movement, or market latency), the marketplace will reject the order and notify you of such rejection. You will not be charged for a rejected Trading Transaction.

You understand and acknowledge that payments made to WhatRocks or to Charities are not tax-deductible as charitable donations.

You may use your Digital Tokens exclusively to (1) reward Individuals financially when they are exposed to, engage or interact with your WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material, or (2) to make donations to Charities or Fundraisers. Any other use of your Digital Tokens including but not limited to exchanging, lending, selling or redeeming your Digital Tokens against any fiat currency or cryptocurrency is strictly prohibited.

**Rewarding Individuals with Digital Tokens**

You may use your Digital Tokens to reward Individuals financially when they are exposed to, engage or interact with your WhatRocks-enhanced marketing or advertising material. Your Wallet may be used to make debit transactions corresponding to the financial rewards in Digital Tokens you distribute to Individuals. Your rewards are final, irrevocable, non-refundable, non-cancellable, non-reversible and non-exchangeable.

You are solely responsible to determine (1) the forms of exposition, engagement and interactions Individuals need to make to earn Digital Tokens and (2) the number of Digital Tokens you will distribute accordingly. You may keep track of the cumulative number of Digital Tokens you have distributed to Individuals in your Wallet.

As a Licensee that uses the WhatRocks Material (including but not limited to the WhatRocks Material) in your marketing or advertising material, you represent and warrant that you are committing to reward Individuals financially with Digital Tokens when they are exposed to, engage or interact with such material. Any failure of the Licensee to comply with these terms is a material breach of license and WhatRocks and WhatRocks Foundation reserve the right to legally enforce any infringement of their intellectual property rights, including criminal prosecution.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless WhatRocks, WhatRocks Foundation, their subsidiaries and related entities, suppliers, service providers, partners, and each of its or their respective officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees and representatives, harmless from and against any and all claims(including third-party claims), demands, losses, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from any unlawful use of the WhatRocks Material. Your indemnification obligation will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms or after your use of the Service.

**Donating Digital Tokens to Charities**

You may use your Digital Tokens to make donations to the Charities of your choice in particular in the context of matching Digital Token donations. Your Wallet may be used to make debit transactions for the Digital Tokens you donate to the Charities of your choice from the list available in your Wallet or to the fundraisers started by any Member to the benefit of the Charity of the Member’s choice.

Your donations are final, irrevocable, non-refundable, non-cancellable, non-reversible, non-exchangeable and unrestricted (ie Charities may redeem your Digital Tokens for any fiat currency or cryptocurrency and use the monies received in return for any purpose).

WhatRocks makes no representation as to whether all or any portion of your donations of Digital Tokens to Charities or in Fundraisers are tax deductible or eligible for tax credits. You should consult your tax advisor as to the eligibility for any tax break and to the amount of your donation that is tax deductible or eligible for tax recognition, having regard to (among other things) the tax status of the recipient of any donation in any relevant jurisdiction, and particularly if you are awarded a gift or prize in connection with your donation. Please review any relevant terms and conditions of the beneficiary Charity when making a donation.

**Blockchain fees**

Blockchain fees apply to any transactions processed in the Service including Trading Transactions. In particular, blockchain fees come in deduction from (1) the rewards you pay in Digital Tokens to Individuals when they are exposed to, engage or interact with your WhatRocks-enhanced material, and (2) the donations of Digital Tokens you make to Charities and Fundraisers. WhatRocks may change these blockchain fees from time to time to adjust to the fees charged by the underlying software protocols.

### **Founding Members and leading members**

**The pledge of Founding Members and Leading Members**

Some Corporations (“**Founding Members**”, “**Leading Members**”) may elect to commit to the successful development of the WhatRocks Service in generating new revenue streams for Charities by pledging (1) a percentage of their annual digital ad spending, or (2) an annual minimum guaranteed amount of money to buy Digital Tokens that will ultimately be donated to Charities, and/or (3) to advocate for the WhatRocks Service and help it grow with more individuals, corporations and charities joining in.

We may grant you the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-exchangeable status of Founding Member or Leading Member of the WhatRocks Service pursuant to the terms of the Founding Member Agreement or or Leading Member Agreement.

As a Founding member or Leading Member, you will also have access to exclusive features and content including but not limited to organizing Fundraisers for the benefit of the Charity of your choice, featuring and associating your Corporation with the Charities of your choice, or matching Digital Token donations from Individuals.

You are solely responsible for starting a Fundraiser by creating and posting a Fundraiser page in the Service to showcase and share certain information about your Fundraiser and the beneficiary Charity and elicit donations from Individuals. All donations through Fundraisers will be made directly into the Charity’s Account.

You are solely responsible for providing those matching Digital Tokens to the Charity and for complying with any legal obligations associated with such a matching donation. WhatRocks shall have no responsibility for providing such matching Digital Tokens, ensuring that you party provides those Digital Tokens, or ensuring any relevant legal obligations are met.

**Founding Member or Leading Member fees**

The Founding Member Agreement or or Leading Member Agreement is optional and available to any Corporations. Unless other specific provisions have expressly been made, Founding Members and or Leading Member are required to pay an annual upfront, non-refundable founding membership fee subject to the terms of the Founding Member Agreement or Leading Member Agreement.

WhatRocks merely provides a blockchain infrastructure that facilitates that Trading Transaction between you and Corporations. WhatRocks does not act as the agent that transacts on your behalf.

You can sell Digital Tokens and instruct the Service to deposit funds into your Fiat Wallet. If your Trading Transaction cannot be completed for any reason (such as price movement, market latency, inability to find a counterparty for your transaction, or order size), the marketplace will reject the order and notify you of such rejection. You will not be charged for a rejected Trading Transaction.

You may place sell orders on the secondary market to get fiat currency in exchange of your Digital Tokens. Although Digital Tokens have a fixed value, WhatRocks may change the applicable exchange rate in fiat currency from time to time to adjust to the market value of the underlying cryptocurrency.

Should the demand of Digital Tokens represented by the buy orders from Corporations available on the secondary market be insufficient to meet your supply of Digital Tokens, your unsold Digital Tokens remain on your Wallet. While the Digital Tokens that you successfully sold are transferred to the buying Corporations’ Wallet, your Fiat Wallet gets credited with the corresponding amount in fiat currency.

You cannot withdraw or cancel sell orders that are placed in the marketplace: sell orders are non-cancellable, non-exchangeable, non-refundable, non-transferable, irrevocable, and non-reversible.

**Blockchain fees**

Donations are received minus any applicable blockchain fees that apply on each Transaction. WhatRocks may change these blockchain fees from time to time to adjust to the fees charged by the underlying software protocols.

### Ownership of donor lists and data

“Donor Data” shall mean a Donor’s name, address, email address, donation amount, date of transaction, transaction identification number, name of the Charity, name of the Fundraiser, and name of the Item associated with the Donation.

**PURSUANT TO THE PRIVACY POLICY AND UNLESS INDIVIDUALS EXPLICTLY AND FORMALLY CONSENT OTHERWISE, THE LIST OF DONORS WHO MAKE A DONATION TO A CHARITY, CONTRIBUTE TO A FUNDRAISER, OR PURCHASE GIVEBACK ITEMS THROUGH THE SERVICE (“DONOR LISTS”) AND THE DONOR DATA ARE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND ARE NOT SHARED WITH CHARITIES OR MERCHANTS.**

**Data protection and security**
--------------------------------

### **personal data**

You acknowledge that we may process personal data in relation to you (if you are an individual), and personal data that you have provided or in the future provide to us in relation to your employees and other associated or other individuals, in connection with these Terms, or the Service. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that: (i) your disclosure to us of any personal data relating to individuals other than yourself was or will be made in accordance with all applicable data protection and data privacy laws, and those data are accurate, up to date and relevant when disclosed; (ii) before providing any such personal data to us, you have read and understood our [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/privacy-policy), and, in the case of personal data relating to an individual other than yourself, have (or will at the time of disclosure have) provided a copy of that [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/privacy-policy) (as amended from time to time), to that individual; and (iii) if from time to time we provide you with a replacement version of the [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/privacy-policy), you will promptly read that notice and provide a copy to any individual whose personal data you have provided to us.

### **sECURITY BREACH**

If you suspect that your WhatRocks Account or any of your security details have been compromised or if you become aware of any fraud or attempted fraud or any other security incident (including a cyber-security attack) affecting you and/or WhatRocks (together a "Security Breach"), you must notify WhatRocks Support as soon as possible by email free of charge at [Contact Centre](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/contact)  and continue to provide accurate and up to date information throughout the duration of the Security Breach. You must take any steps that we reasonably require to reduce, manage or report any Security Breach. Failure to provide prompt notification of any Security Breach may be taken into account in our determination of the appropriate resolution of the matter.

**Dispute resolution**
----------------------

### **Formal complaint process**

If you have a dispute with WhatRocks or a Member (a “Complaint”), you agree to contact WhatRocks through our support team to attempt to resolve any such dispute amicably. The parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the dispute that is satisfactory to all parties.

**If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through the WhatRocks support team, you and we agree to use the Formal Complaint Process set forth below.** You agree to use this process before filing any arbitration claim or small claims action. If you do not follow the procedures set out in this Section before filing an arbitration claim or suit in small claims court, we shall have the right to ask the arbitrator or small claims court to dismiss your filing unless and until you complete the following steps.

### **Procedural steps**

In the event that your dispute with WhatRocks or a Member is not resolved through your contact with WhatRocks Support, you agree to use our Complaint form to describe your Complaint, how you would like us to resolve the Complaint, and any other information related to your dispute that you believe to be relevant. The Complaint form will be provided to you by WhatRocks Support.

### **WhatRocks response**

We will acknowledge receipt of your Complaint form after you submit it. A WhatRocks customer relations agent ("Agent") will review your Complaint. The Agent will evaluate your Complaint based on the information you have provided and information in the possession of WhatRocks. Within 15 business days of our receipt of your Complaint form, the Agent will address the issues raised in your Complaint form by sending you an e-mail ("Resolution Notice") in which the Agent will: (i) offer to resolve your complaint in the way you requested; (ii) make a determination rejecting your Complaint and set out the reasons for the rejection; or (iii) offer to resolve your Complaint with an alternative solution. In exceptional circumstances, if the Agent is unable to respond to your Complaint within 30 business days for reasons beyond WhatRocks’ control, the Agent will send you a communication indicating the reasons for any delay in answering your Complaint, and specifying the deadline by which the Agent will respond to your Complaint, which will be no later than 60 business days from our receipt of your Complaint form.

### **Arbitration, waiver of class action**

**If we cannot resolve the dispute through the Formal Complaint Process, you and we agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the WhatRocks Service, including, without limitation, federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, shall be resolved through binding arbitration, on an individual basis (the “Arbitration Agreement”). Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Canadian Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes.**

**This Arbitration Agreement includes, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.**

**CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WHATROCKS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.**

The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. An arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. To the extent permitted by law, the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce these Terms, any arbitration pursuant to these Terms, or any small claims action shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law.

### **Computer viruses**

We shall not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses or other malicious code that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack. We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and email service are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from WhatRocks.

### **Release of WhatRocks, indemnification**

If you have a dispute with one or more Users of the Service, you release WhatRocks, its subsidiaries and related entities, its service providers, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees and representatives from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. You agree to indemnify and hold WhatRocks, its subsidiaries and related entities, and its service providers, and each of its or their respective officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees and representatives, harmless from any claim or demand (including attorneys' fees and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to your breach of these Terms or your violation of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any third-party.

### **Limitation of liability, no warranty**

IN NO EVENT SHALL WHATROCKS, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND RELATED ENTITIES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, BE LIABLE (A) FOR ANY AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE SUPPORTED DIGITAL CURRENCY ON DEPOSIT IN YOUR WHATROCKS ACCOUNT(S) OR (B) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, CORRUPTION OR BREACH OF DATA OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE PROPERTY OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH AUTHORIZED OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE SERVICE, OR THESE TERMS, EVEN IF AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF WHATROCKS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF A FINAL JUDICIAL DETERMINATION THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE A RESULT OF WHATROCKS’ GROSS NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR INTENTIONAL VIOLATION OF LAW. THIS MEANS, BY WAY OF EXAMPLE ONLY (AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE), THAT IF YOU CLAIM THAT WHATROCKS FAILED TO PROCESS A TRANSACTION PROPERLY, YOUR DAMAGES ARE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE SUPPORTED DIGITAL CURRENCY AT ISSUE IN THE TRANSACTION, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT RECOVER FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR OTHER TYPES OF SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE VALUE OF THE SUPPORTED DIGITAL CURRENCY AT ISSUE IN THE TRANSACTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WHATROCKS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WHATROCKS DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT ACCESS TO THE SITE, ANY PART OF THE WHATROCKS SERVICE, OR ANY OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED THEREIN, WILL BE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, OR ERROR-FREE. WHATROCKS DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY ORDER WILL BE EXECUTED, ACCEPTED, RECORDED OR REMAIN OPEN. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS STATEMENTS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NOT RELIED UPON ANY OTHER STATEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE AND ACCESS OF THE WHATROCKS SERVICE AND WHATROCKS SITE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, YOU HEREBY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WHATROCKS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (A) ANY INACCURACY, DEFECT OR OMISSION OF DIGITAL CURRENCY PRICE DATA, (B) ANY ERROR OR DELAY IN THE TRANSMISSION OF SUCH DATA, OR (C) INTERRUPTION IN ANY SUCH DATA.

Furthermore, WhatRocks, its subsidiaries and related entities, suppliers, partners and agents make no warranty that (i) its Service or any products or service provided through the Service will meet your requirements; (ii) the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free, or that it will operate in a bug-free manner, (iii) that WhatRocks will fix any errors; (iv) you will obtain any specific results from use of the Service; or (v) any Content on the Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. Any Content obtained through use of the Service is obtained at your own discretion and risk and WhatRocks shall not be responsible for any damage caused to your computer or data or for any bugs, viruses, Trojan horses or other destructive code resulting from use of the Service or any Content obtained from the Service. Some provinces or states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. You may also have other legal rights, which vary from province to province and from state to state.

WhatRocks makes no representations about the accuracy, order, timeliness or completeness of historical Digital Currency price data available on the Service. WhatRocks will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but WhatRocks makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing which is dependent upon many factors outside of our control.

We may decide to cease making available the Service or any portion of the Service at any time and for any reason. Under no circumstances will WhatRocks, its subsidiaries and related entities, suppliers, partners or agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability.

To the fullest extent permitted under law, WhatRocks, its subsidiaries and related entities, suppliers, partners and agents have no obligation or liability (whether arising in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise) for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages or liabilities (including, but not limited to, any loss of data or content, revenue or profit, or personal injury or death) arising from or related to your use of the Service or any Content provided by or through the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages in advance. This limitation applies to damages arising from (i) your use or inability to use and access the Service; (ii) cost of procurement of substitute products or services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration or distribution of Content you submit through the Service; (iv) third-party Content made available to you through the Service; or (v) any other matter relating to any aspect of the Service, including the website, the API, any present or future apps, email communications and content from the Service on third-party sites. Some countries and states do not allow the limitation or exclusion of incidental, consequential or other types of damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, WhatRocks’s liability and the liability of each of its subsidiaries and related entities, suppliers, partners and agents to you or any third parties under any circumstance is limited to the greater of one hundred US dollars ($100 USD) or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve (12) months.

You agree to indemnify, defend (if we so request) and hold harmless WhatRocks, its subsidiaries and related entities, suppliers, partners and agents from and against any claims (including third-party claims), demands, losses, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from the Content you post or submit, your use of and connection to the WhatRocks website, applications, API, and any other aspect of the Service, your violation of these Terms or your violation of any rights of any third-party. Your indemnification obligation will survive the termination or the expiration of these Terms or after your use of the Service.

These Terms of Use, the Founding Member Agreement, the Privacy Policy, the Cookie Policy, the [Community Guidelines](https://www.whatrocks.co/en/community-guidelines) and the Branding and Graphic Guidelines incorporated by reference herein comprise the entire understanding and agreement between you and WhatRocks as to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of these Terms), and every nature between and among you and WhatRocks. Section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not govern the meaning or interpretation of any provision of these Terms.

### **Assignment**

You may not assign any rights and/or licenses granted under these Terms. We reserve the right to assign our rights without restriction, including without limitation to any WhatRocks subsidiaries and related entities, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the WhatRocks Service. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

### **Severability**

If any provision of these Terms shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these Terms shall not be affected.

### **Change of control**

In the event that WhatRocks is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

### **Survival**

All provisions of these Terms which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination of these Terms, including, without limitation, sections pertaining to restriction, suspension, removal, cancellation or termination, WhatRocks Account cancellation, debts owed to WhatRocks, general use of the Service, disputes with WhatRocks, and general provisions, shall survive the termination or expiration of these Terms or after your use of the Service.

### **Force majeure**

We shall not be liable for delays, failure in performance or interruption of service under these Terms which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to, significant market volatility, any delay or failure due to any act of God, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorists, civil disturbance, war, blockade, riot, strike, or other labor dispute, fire, natural disaster, interruption in telecommunications or Internet Service or network provider Service, failure of equipment and/or software, or refusal of approval or a license by a government agency, other catastrophe or any other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

### **Non-waiver of rights**

These Terms shall not be construed to waive rights that cannot be waived under applicable state money transmission laws in the states or provinces where you are located.

If we waive any of our rights in any particular instance, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights generally or in the future. If we do not enforce all our rights all of the time under these Terms, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights, and we may decide to enforce them at a later date. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted under these Terms, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us to another company or person without restriction.
