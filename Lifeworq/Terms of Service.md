Terms of use
============

By using the website lifeworq.com and our services, you accept the following terms of use.

### 1\. Parties

The terms of use for non-commercial users apply within the scope of the contractual agreements between LifeworQ Jobs GmbH, Lerchenweg 3, 40789 Monheim am Rhein, Germany, hereinafter also referred to as 'LifeworQ' and 'we' and the visitors of the website lifeworq.com as well as the users of our services and those interested in them, hereinafter only referred to as 'user' and 'you'. Our services, to which these terms of use refer, are only intended for use by natural persons and for the purpose of searching for job offers. Depending on the service, further conditions may apply, about which we will inform you if they apply. If you do not agree to our terms of use, you are prohibited from using our website and services.

If you are an employer or recruiter, these terms of use do not apply, our General Terms and Conditions for Employers and Recruiters apply instead.

### 2\. Object of the agreement

a. Use of the website lifeworq.com

You can use the website lifeworq.com without registering. Your usage extends to using the website to search for job offers. If you click on a job offer you may be redirected to websites that are not owned by LifeworQ and over the contents of which we have no control and for which we therefore assume no liability. We may be paid for these redirections by employers or job exchanges.

b. Job assistant

LifeworQ offers its users a job assistant as a free subscription to search for job offers. The job assistant is sent to you regularly by email and contains job offers that match your search behaviour or the profile you have created. If you click on a job offer you may be redirected to websites that are not owned by LifeworQ and over the contents of which we have no control and for which we therefore assume no liability. You can subscribe to the job assistant without creating a Lifeworq account by registering to the subscription. You will then receive an email with a confirmation link to confirm that you actually want to subscribe to regular emails with job offers and that it is not an unwanted registration that you have not initiated. You can unsubscribe from the job assistant at any time by clicking on a link in the job assistant.

c. Lifeworq account

LifeworQ also offers its users the option of creating a free Lifeworq account. The services this includes and the necessary registration are described below.

i. Favourites

With a Lifeworq account you can save job offers that you are interested in as favourites. You can access your favourites at any time in your Lifeworq account as long as they are available. We reserve the right to analyse your favourites and search queries and to remind you of your favourites by email.

ii. Profile and CV

If you have a Lifeworq account, you can fill out your profile with your personal details and qualifications. You can also upload relevant documents such as your CV to your profile. We reserve the right to analyse your profile details and the data in your uploaded documents and to use them to improve our service. You can apply for jobs directly via lifeworq.com using your profile and the uploaded documents, if the employer has requested this function for the advertised position. If the employer has a Lifeworq employer account, they will receive your application together with the data you have provided via the website lifeworq.com. If this is not the case your application, including the data you have provided, will be sent by email. Personal information that you submit to LifeworQ or provide to LifeworQ as part of profile creation and the application process should not include the following information:

* racial or ethnic origin
* political beliefs
* religious or philosophical beliefs
* trade union membership
* genetic data
* biometric data for the sole purpose of identifying a natural person
* health-related data
* data regarding the sexual life or sexual orientation of a natural person

If you use the service, you guarantee and warrant that you have not provided the above information.

As Lifeworq customers from all over the world can post job advertisements on lifeworq.com, it is possible that the respective employer is located outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, which is why it is part of the contract that such companies from other countries can also access your data. We store your applications so that you can track your application history in your Lifeworq account at any time.

iii. Automatic job assistant

When you create a Lifeworq account, you automatically subscribe to the job assistant described in Section 2 b. You can cancel the free subscription at any time via your Lifeworq account settings or via a link in the job assistant. You can also use the settings to determine how often you want to receive the job assistant.

iv. Registration

When registering a Lifeworq account, you must provide a valid email address and a password. To use the service, it is necessary for this data to be stored. We will send you a confirmation email with a link. Follow this link, confirm that you agree with these terms of use and that you need to create a Lifeworq account. The sending of the confirmation email or your confirmation is not an acceptance of the contract by LifeworQ and does not constitute the conclusion of the contract. The contract only becomes effective when we activate your Lifeworq account. There is no legal claim to the conclusion of a contract.

You must also provide further information about your person. These must be up-to-date, complete and truthful. If you upload a profile picture, it must depict you. In particular and in your own interest, your contact details should be up-to-date in case an employer wishes to contact you. The Lifeworq account is only for your own use and not for use by third parties. It is not transferable. Your email address linked to the Lifeworq account may also only be used by you personally. Only one account may be created per user. You are also not permitted to create an account for third parties or non-existing persons, even if the third party has given their consent.

### 3\. Right of withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days after conclusion of the contract without giving reasons. The withdrawal period is 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract. To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must notify us LifeworQ Jobs GmbH, Lerchenweg 3, 40789 Monheim am Rhein, Germany, email: [\[emailÂ protected\]](https://lifeworq.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) by means of a clear statement (e.g. letter or email) that you intend to withdraw from this contract. You can use the attached sample withdrawal form, which is, however, not mandatory. In order to comply with the withdrawal period, it is sufficient to send the notification that you are exercising your right of withdrawal before the end of the withdrawal period.

As a result, LifeworQ is contracted by the user to store and host this data and, if applicable, to make it available to employers. This data is only used within the scope of these terms of use.

### 7\. Guarantee, availability, backup, data protection and confidentiality

a. Guarantee

LifeworQ assumes no guarantee for the timeliness, accuracy, completeness, usefulness, or suitability of any data on our website and services for any particular purpose. Nor do we guarantee the conclusion of an employment contract between persons using our website and services and an employer.

b. Availability

Likewise, we do not guarantee that our website and services will be uninterrupted, error-free, available for specific periods of time, or that they will be error-free. Errors, conditional availability or limited functionality may occur due to maintenance work and improvements and do not establish any claims for the user. You have no legal claim to the use of the website lifeworq.com or to free services described in these terms of use.

c. Backup

LifeworQ performs regular backups of its servers. Nevertheless, data loss cannot be completely excluded. We therefore recommend that you make backup copies of the data that you transfer to us when using our services. Especially if you terminate your contract with us because we do not keep a copy of your data after deletion, unless there is a legal obligation to store it.

d. Data protection and confidentiality

The collection and processing of your personal data is performed with due regard and compliance to the applicable data protection laws.

### 8\. Liability

Claims for damages by users are excluded; this exclusion does not apply to claims for damages due to injury to life, limb or health, or to damages resulting from intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by LifeworQ, its legal representatives or vicarious agents. In case of material or financial damage caused by slightly negligent behaviour of LifeworQ, a legal representative or a vicarious agent of LifeworQ, LifeworQ is only liable in case of a material breach of an essential contractual obligation, but only up to the amount of typical damages foreseeable in case of conclusion of the contract. Material contractual obligations are obligations the fulfilment of which enables the proper performance of an agreement and on the observance of which the contracting parties may regularly rely. Any possible liability under the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected. Any further liability of LifeworQ is excluded.

LifeworQ is not liable due to legal regulations in case of slight negligence. As far as LifeworQ's liability is excluded or limited, this also applies to the personal liability of LifeworQ's legal representatives, executives and vicarious agents.

### 9\. Termination

Either party may terminate this agreement at any time with immediate effect. When the agreement on the use of the Lifeworq account or the job assistant ends, we will delete your personal data that we have stored, unless processing is required by law and for another purpose.
