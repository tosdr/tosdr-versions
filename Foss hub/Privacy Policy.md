### General information to all international visitors ( updated 16 August 2012 )

We would like to inform you that we are now using Google interest-based advertising technology. This technology is implemented by "us" www.FossHub.com using Google. This will not be used to identify you or your location, it will be used only to help our advertising system ( AdSense ) provided by Google to show more relevant Ads to our visitors.  
We also use the DoubleClick DART cookie from Google. What is the DoubleClick DART cookie?  
"The DoubleClick DART cookie is used by Google in the ads served on publisher websites displaying AdSense for content ads. When users visit an AdSense publisher's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help AdSense publishers better serve and manage the ads on their site(s) and across the web."  
"Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.  
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet."  
"We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. "  
Besides Google AdSense we also use Google Analytics which may collect data. We can't say what kind of data is being collected, for more information you might want to check/read for their privacy policy or terms of agreement - please see the links below:
