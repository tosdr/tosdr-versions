The EU is implementing new data privacy rules, known as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While we fully support and are working diligently toward meeting all GDPR requirements, we have determined that we will not complete this effort by the regulation’s start date later this month. As a result, we will temporarily stop providing our service to EU customers, and we will stop providing service to all EU residents on May 23.

For all customers outside the EU and the European Economic Area, nothing will change and you will be able to continue using Unroll.Me without issue.

For our customers in the EU and in the European Economic Area, the Unroll.Me team is committed to re-introducing our service as quickly as possible so please stay tuned for updates.

To all our customers everywhere, Unroll.Me is a completely secure service and our users' privacy is of paramount concern. Your personal data has always been secure with us.  

If you have any questions or concerns about this topic, please [reach out to us](https://support.unroll.me/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000062972).
