* you authorize us to collect other types of information, and
* we automatically collect certain types of information.

Information that we automatically collect. We may automatically collect information about the way that you use or interact with our Service.

Here are some of the types of automated data collection that occur when you use our sites:

Web Browsers: When you visit one of our websites, your browser automatically sends us your internet protocol (“IP”) address so that the web pages you request can be sent to your computer or device. We use your IP address to determine additional information, such as whether the computer or device has ever been used to visit our site before, which site features were used most often, and how much time was spent on a page.

Cookies: We automatically collect information through “cookies,” which are text files placed on your device’s hard drive when you visit websites. Cookies can enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies to help us manage and understand how you use our website.

These web beacons allow third parties to collect information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any additional information in cookies that may have been set by the third party. The information is typically collected in log files, which generally track traffic on our websites.

Your Rights Regarding Personal Information. California residents have certain rights with respect to the personal information collected by businesses. If you are a California resident, you may exercise the following rights regarding your personal information, subject to certain exceptions and limitations:

* The **right to know** what personal information the business has collected about you, including the categories of personal information, the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information, the categories of third parties to whom the business discloses personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information the business has collected about you;
* The **right to request that we delete** the personal information we have collected from you or maintain about you.
* The right to **correct** inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.
* The right to **opt out of our sale(s)** or sharing of your personal information. Please note that if you opt out of certain types of sales or sharing, we will be unable to provide you with the services that rely on such sales or sharing.
* The **right not to receive discriminatory treatment** for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.
* The **right to limit** the use of your sensitive personal information to only that which is necessary for providing you products or services.

Duration of Processing
----------------------

We may actively process your personal information so long as you are active in our Service. We may, however, store your information for up to 7 full years after the date that you terminate your account in order to prepare the measurement products and services if you are participating in our measurement panel, and where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example to respond to a query you requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, audit and other requirements). Where we are able, we store this information pseudonymized or anonymized form. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Transfers of Information
------------------------

As part of our international operations, we may transfer information about you to a jurisdiction where we do business.

These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). However, we have taken appropriate safeguards (such as contractual commitments) to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For data transfers to entities in countries that have not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission, we may use specific contracts promulgated by the European Commission, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses. Alternatively, in certain circumstances, we may transfer your personal data on the basis of a specific derogation or exemption recognized under applicable data protection law. For further details relating to the transfers described above and the adequate safeguards used with respect to such transfers, please email us at [privacy@unroll.me](mailto:privacy@unroll.me).

Updates to Our Privacy Policy
-----------------------------

This privacy policy may be updated periodically to you to reflect changes in our information practices or relevant laws. We will indicate at the top of the policy when it was updated. Substantial changes to this policy will be effective 30 days after posting. Please review this policy any time you access or use our sites to make sure you have reviewed the most recent version.
