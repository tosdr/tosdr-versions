Terms of Service (“Terms”)
==========================

Last updated: November 30th 2021

Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”) carefully before using the http://crankwheel.com/ and/or http://syna.is/ and/or http://meeting.is/ websites (the “Service”) operated by CrankWheel ehf. (“us”, “we”, or “our”).

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service, including customers, meaning parties who pay a subscription fee to use the Service, unless such customers have a separate written contract with us.

**By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. Your usage limits depend on your selected plan, free or paid, with plan limits defined on our [pricing page](https://crankwheel.com/pricing/). If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.**

**Content**

Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material (“Content”). You are responsible for the Content that you post to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

When posting Content to the Service, you are entitled to, subject to these Terms of Service use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through the Service. You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights. You agree that this license includes the right for us to make your Content available to users of the Service, who you decide that may also use your Content, such use to be subject to these Terms.

You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person.

**Accounts**

When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.

You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trade mark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.

You may not use a name for your organization’s account or reserve a URL for your organization unless that name and/or the customized part of the URL is a typical moniker for your organization or company (or yourself), and we reserve the right to modify organization account names and URLs should you be in breach of this provision or in cases of trademark violation or other legal actions where we are compelled to intervene.

Only one company/organization account should be created for use of CrankWheel by each organization, company or other entity, unless you are a paying customer and have signed an agreement with us in order to create multiple accounts within an organization. We reserve the right to combine accounts where we find multiple organization accounts being used by one organization.

Further, in the same spirit of each team working together sharing a single usage quota, for situations where team members are individual contractors working for the same entity, we reserve the right to collectively count all such team members’ usage towards a single quota even when accounts are not combined.

**Subscriptions**

Certain functionalities of the service may be available only to paying subscribers.

If you become a subscriber, you can easily cancel your subscription at any time. There are no cancellation fees, though no refunds are provided for prorated periods.

**Processing of Personal Data**

By providing Service to you we may as processors process Personal Data which you as a Data Controller are responsible for. Our processing of Personal Data deriving from you or your customers will be only on documented instructions from you which are documented in these Terms. Our processing of such information will be undertaken only by persons who are bound by confidentiality provisions in agreements or are acting under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

All our processing of Personal Information is subject to appropriate technical and organisational measures designated by us.

You consent to our use of subcontractors; provided that you have the right to subsequently revoke such consent. We do provide an accurate and complete written list of subcontractors in our [Data Protection Statement](https://crankwheel.com/data-protection/). We will notify you of any proposed changes to our subcontractors during the term of your account with us.

At your request, we shall cooperate and reasonably assist you with your compliance obligations under Data Protection Laws, including in relation to data security, data breach notification, data protection impact assessments and related consultations with any supervisory authority, the fulfilment of Data Subjects’ rights, and any enquiry, notice or investigation by a supervisory authority.

We shall make available to you all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in these Terms. During normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, you may conduct, or engage an independent third party (bound by appropriate obligations of confidentiality) to conduct, an audit of our compliance with our obligations under these Terms. We will cooperate and reasonably assist with any such audit.

Upon termination of the account, we will upon your request destroy all Personal Data and all copies thereof and certify such destruction in writing, except to the extent we are required by law to keep a copy of the Company Personal Data.

**Copyright Policy**

We respect the intellectual property rights of others. It is our policy to respond to any possible claim that Content posted on the Service infringes the copyright or other intellectual property infringement (“Infringement”) of any person.

If you are a copyright owner, or authorized on behalf of one, and you believe that the copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement that is taking place through the Service, you must submit your notice in writing to the attention of “Copyright Infringement” of dmca@crankwheel.com and include in your notice a detailed description of the alleged Infringement.

You may be held accountable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) for misrepresenting that any Content is infringing your copyright.

**Termination**

**Governing Law**

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Iceland, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.

**Changes**

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
