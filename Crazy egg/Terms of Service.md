We reserve any and all rights that are not expressly granted in these Terms of Use.
    
3. ### Fees
    
    1. #### Subscription Terms
        
        Crazy Egg offers a range of subscription plans to its Analysis Services, including, without limitation, a "Basic Plan," a "Standard Plan," a "Plus Plan," a "Pro Plan," and "Custom Plans." As an express condition of your use of and access to the Analysis Service, you agree to pay all fees applicable to your subscription plan (your "Plan"), any other fees for additional services you may purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Analysis Service. To view the specific details of your Plan, including pricing information and the commencement date of your next renewal period, visit the Crazy Egg Website, login at https://www.crazyegg.com/login and from the sidebar navigation select “Account”, then “Your Profile”, after logging in.
        
        The Analysis Service is priced based on usage, determined by the number of page views (each, a "Visit") of a registered web page for a Client Site for a specified usage period (each, a "Session"). With respect to each such Client Site, Crazy Egg will not, and will have no obligation to, collect, maintain, provide or analyze any further information relating to your Client Site, analyze such information in reports or provide information or reports once you (i) reach the maximum number of Visits for your Session, as specified in your Plan; or (ii) reach the maximum amount of usage time for your Session, as specified in your Plan, whichever occurs first.
        
    2. #### Changes in Fees
        
        We may, upon any notice required by applicable law, change the fees for the Analysis Service at any time or require new fees or charges. Such changes will be effective immediately upon posting on Our Website; provided, however, that such fee changes will be effective only as to prospective Analysis Service orders (including renewals) accepted by Crazy Egg after the effective date of such change. Please be aware that any discounts applicable to previous subscriptions may not apply to renewed subscriptions.
        
    3. #### Payment of Fees
        
        Your Plan, which may start with a Free Trial Period (described below), will renew automatically and continue month-to-month or year-to-year (depending on your Plan) unless and until you cancel your Plan or we terminate it, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (see Section 3.6 (Account Cancellation) and Section 12 (Term and Termination)). You must cancel your Plan before it renews in order to avoid fees due under the next billing cycle. To view the specific details of your Plan, including the commencement date of your next renewal period, visit the Crazy Egg Website, login at https://www.crazyegg.com/login and from the sidebar navigation select “Account”, then “Your Profile”, after logging in. We will bill the fees due under your Plan to the credit card you provide to us during registration (or to a different credit card if you change your payment information). You acknowledge that the amount billed for each renewal period may vary due to promotional offers, changes in your Plan, and changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize us to bill you the corresponding amounts.
        
        We reserve the right to deactivate your access to the Analysis Service for failure to pay applicable fees as described in this Agreement. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are stated in U.S. Dollars.
        
    4. #### Credit Card Payments
        
        All fees for your Plan will be billed to your credit card. You authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts described herein and in your Plan and authorize us (or a billing agent acting on our behalf) to continue charging all such amounts to your credit card account until you or we cancel or terminate your Plan as provided herein or these amounts are paid in full, whichever is later. You must provide current, complete and accurate billing and credit card information. You must promptly update all billing information (such as billing address, card number and expiration date) to keep your account current, complete and accurate, and you must promptly notify Crazy Egg if your credit card is lost or stolen, or if you become aware of a potential breach of security (such as an unauthorized disclosure or use of your username or password). You authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates for your credit card in the event that the credit card you provided us expires. We reserve the right to charge any renewal card issued to you as a replacement. If payment is not received from your credit card issuer, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. You agree to pay all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and costs, on any outstanding balance. In certain instances, the issuer of your credit card may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Please check with your bank and credit card issuer for details.
        
    5. #### Payment Terms, Refunds, and Upgrade and Downgrade Terms
        
        1. The fees for your Plan are billed in advance, are non-refundable, and automatically renew on a monthly or annual basis, as specified in your Plan. No refunds or credits will be provided for partial months of the Analysis Service, upgrades/downgrades, or for months unused with an open account.
            
        2. If you downgrade your Plan level, your credit card will automatically be charged the new rate beginning with your next billing cycle. Downgrading your Plan may cause the loss of account content, features, or capacity. Crazy Egg does not accept any liability for such loss.
            
        3. If you upgrade your Plan level, your credit card will immediately be charged a pro-rated amount reflecting the increased rate, and you will be charged the full amount of the new rate beginning with your next billing cycle.
            
        4. Any discounts applied to a previous subscription may not apply to a renewed subscription, including to any automatic renewals.
            
        
    6. #### Account Cancellation
        
        1. The only valid method for canceling your Plan is via the cancellation link provided on the “Account", “Your Profile” page, accessible after logging in to the Crazy Egg Website. Requests to cancel by e-mail or phone are not considered, and do not accomplish, cancellation.
            
        2. If you cancel your Plan before the end of your current pre-paid period, you will not be charged again for your Plan beginning with the next billing cycle. If you cancel your Plan, you will lose all access, upon the expiration of your current pre-paid period, to the Analysis Service and any data or information stored in your account (see Section 12 (Term and Termination) for additional details). If you cancel your Plan during a Free Trial Period, effective upon such cancellation, you will immediately lose all access to the Analysis Service and any data or information stored in your account.
            
        
    7. #### Free Trial Period
        
        1. Crazy Egg may offer, during the registration process, a one-time free trial period during which you can try out the Analysis Service for 30 days from the date you register to use the Analysis Service without pre-paying in advance ("Free Trial Period"). To view the specific details regarding your Free Trial Period, if any, visit the Crazy Egg Website, login at https://www.crazyegg.com/login and from the sidebar navigation select “Account”, then “Your Profile”, after logging in.
            
        2. If you participate in a Free Trial Period, you must cancel the Analysis Service by the end of the Free Trial Period to avoid incurring any charges. If you do not cancel the Analysis Service before the Free Trial Period expires, you authorize us to charge your credit card the full cost of your Plan, as described to you during the registration process. Your Plan will then automatically renew and continue month-to-month or year-to-year (depending on your Plan), unless and until you cancel your Plan or we terminate it (see Section 3.6 (Account Cancellation) and Section 12 (Term and Termination)). You will not receive a notice from Crazy Egg that your Free Trial Period is about to end or has ended.
            
        3. In some instances, the available balance or credit limit on the credit card provided during the registration process may be reduced to reflect the pre-authorization of certain de minimis charges related to your Plan; however, no charges will be made against your credit card unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your Free Trial Period.
            
        4. You may cancel your Plan at any time during the Free Trial Period by following the steps described in Section 3.6 (Account Cancellation). Upon cancelling your account, you will immediately lose all access to the Analysis Service and any data or information stored within your account (see Section 12 (Term and Termination) for additional details).
            
        5. Crazy Egg reserves the right to modify, cancel and/or limit the Free Trial Period offer at any time.

    2. #### Your Obligations With Respect to Client Site Visitors and Other Third Parties
        
        With respect to Client Site Visitors, you will (i) comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your use of the Analysis Services and Client Data (ii) provide notice to and obtain consent from any Client Site Visitor, before using Analysis Service to capture any information from such Client Site Visitor (iii) not use the Analysis Service to collect Personally Identifiable Information; (iv) not use the Analysis Service to associate any data gathered from your Client Site with any Personally Identifiable Information from any source including your own records; or (v) pass on or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information of any Client Site Visitors to Crazy Egg and/or the Analysis Service for any purpose, whether through Materials that you submit or upload to Our Website, or otherwise.
        
        You agree and acknowledge that Crazy Egg does not knowingly or willfully collect Personally Identifiable Information from Client Site Visitors and that you alone are responsible for configuring the Analysis Services to prevent collection of Personally Identifiable Information from Client Site Visitors. If and to the extent that your Client Site collects Personally Identifiable Information or other content from Client Site Visitors, such as, by way of example, through a form submitted by a Client Site Visitor to the Client Site, appearance of Personally Identifiable Information in an unmasked area of a Client Site page, or by submission of multimedia content by Client Site Visitors to the Client Site, you will notify Crazy Egg in advance of any such collections (“Visitor Submitted Content”) and fully cooperate with Crazy Egg in the removal of such Personally Identifiable Information at your own cost.
        
        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you are solely responsible for compliance with applicable laws regarding any Personally Identifiable Information that may be collected from the Client Site Visitors and accessed by the Crazy Egg Technology in the performance of the Services, including, by way of example, through the recording of any forms or multimedia content submitted by or recorded from Client Site Visitors, or through logging mouse clicks or keystrokes by Client Site Visitors on the respective Client Sites. Except as may be required by applicable laws or legal authorities or as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy), Crazy Egg will not knowingly share any Personally Identifiable Information in any Visitor Submitted Content with any third parties. Crazy Egg otherwise disclaims, to you and to any Client Site Visitor, any liabilities with respect to any use or storage of Visitor Submitted Content; such disclaimers shall be included amongst the Flow-Down Provisions described at the end of this Section 5.2 (Your Obligations with Respect to Client Site Visitors and Other Third Parties).
        
        You will implement, make accessible via a clear and prominent link on each Client Site that uses the Analysis Service, and abide by a privacy policy that complies with all applicable laws relating to the collection and disclosure of information from Client Site Visitors. Such policy must provide notice to Client Site Visitors of (A) your use of any cookie that collects anonymous data about Client Site Visitors; (B) the deployment and use of the Client Site Visitor Cookie, as described under Section 5.1 (Cookies Used by the Crazy Egg Script for Client); (C) your use of the Analysis Service; (D) a link to Crazy's Egg's [Privacy Policy](https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy); and (E) a link to Crazy Egg's [opt-out](https://www.crazyegg.com/opt-out) feature.
        
        You will include, as flow-down provisions in your terms of use and privacy policies for your Client Sites, as well as in any agreements with third parties for the provision or use of content on Client Sites, the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policies with respect to Client Site Visitors, Visitor Submitted Content, any disclaimers of liability by Crazy Egg, the limitation of liability set forth in Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) and the terms of Section 15 (Arbitration; Dispute Resolution) (collectively, “Flow-Down Provisions”), and Crazy Egg and its affiliates shall be identified in your terms of use, privacy policies, and other binding instruments with your Client Site Visitors as third party beneficiaries of such Flow-Down Provisions.

For maximum protection, you should protect against unauthorized access to your username and password and remember to log off when using any shared computer or device. Crazy Egg has implemented reasonable security mechanisms to protect your information and Client Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Examples of these security mechanisms include limited access, firewalls and SSL encryption to protect transmission of data. However, please keep in mind that no security system is impenetrable. It may be possible for third parties to intercept or access Client Data, information you provide to Crazy Egg, information we compile on your behalf, and/or information that we collect about you. Crazy Egg cannot guarantee the security of such information and is not responsible for unauthorized access to Client accounts. We disclaim any liability for any theft or loss of, unauthorized access or damage to, or interception of any data or communications of Clients, Client Site Visitors, or Other Users.
        
    4. #### Crazy Egg Limits Access to Your Information

This information will be presented only in aggregate form, and in no event will we compile specific site data that identifies Clients without Client permission, nor will be knowingly disclose any Personally Identifying Information of Client Site Visitors, except to the extent set forth in Section 5.4 (Crazy Egg Limits Access to Your Information) or in the [Privacy Policy](https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy).

13. ### Modifications to this agreement and other policies
    
    Our employees are not authorized to vary the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement may be modified only (i) by obtaining our written consent in a notarized agreement signed by an officer of Crazy Egg; or (ii) as set forth below in the immediately following paragraph.

We will notify you of any material revisions or modifications to the Agreement by posting a notice on the Crazy Egg Website for 30 days following any revisions or modifications to this Agreement and/or by posting a notice on the Crazy Egg Website the first time that you visit the Crazy Egg Website following such revisions or modifications.

15. ### Arbitration; Dispute resolution
    
    EXCEPT AS PROVIDED ABOVE OR WHERE OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND CRAZY EGG UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS, DISPUTES OR CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN YOU AND CRAZY EGG, ITS PARENTS, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES OR RELATED COMPANIES (INCLUDING DISPUTES AGAINST ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, SUBSIDIARY, AFFILIATE, PREDECESSOR IN INTEREST, SUCCESSOR, OR ASSIGN OF THE OTHER) RELATING TO THE SITE, THE INFORMATION AND MATERIALS PUBLISHED BY CRAZY EGG ON OR THROUGH THE SITE, ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE, COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN US, AND YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES OR THE USE OF OUR SERVICES BY CLIENTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS, CLAIMS BASED UPON ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL STATUTE, LAW, ORDER, ORDINANCE OR REGULATION, AND THE ISSUE OF ARBITRABILITY, SHALL BE RESOLVED BY THE FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION PROCEDURES SET BELOW. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY IN THE PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL. ANY CONTROVERSY CONCERNING WHETHER A DISPUTE IS ARBITRABLE SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY THE COURT. JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED BY A CALIFORNIA STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THIS ARBITRATION CONTRACT IS MADE PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND ITS INTERPRETATION, APPLICATION, ENFORCEMENT AND PROCEEDINGS HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, CONSTRUED, AND ENFORCED, BOTH PROCEDURALLY AND SUBSTANTIVELY, BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT 9 U.S.C. § 1-9 ("FAA"), TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THIS SECTION 15 (ARBITRATION; DISPUTE RESOLUTION) SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THE SERVICES OR OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS.
    
    **The following procedures shall apply:**
    
    i) Any party that intends to make a claim shall first notify the opposing party in writing of such intention and shall describe in such notice, with reasonable particularity, the nature and basis of such claim, and the total amount of the claim. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the party receiving notice of a claim shall provide a written response which, with reasonable particularity, sets forth its position concerning the claim. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute arising from the claim by good faith negotiations to be conducted within the thirty (30)-day period following the written response, either of them may initiate binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
    
    ii) In the event a party elects to proceed with binding arbitration, it shall provide written notice thereof to the other party by registered or certified mail. The arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and shall be conducted using the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA (except as varied by this agreement). The arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles County, California, but may proceed telephonically in the event the total amount of the claim does not exceed $10,000 U.S. dollars (if the claimant so chooses).
    
    iii) Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by AAA's rules.
    
    iv) If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall select JAMS.
    
    **BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.** In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal than a court trial; however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award.
    
    Separate and apart from the agreement to arbitrate set forth above, the parties hereby independently waive any right to bring or participate in any class action in any way related to, or arising from, this agreement. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is non-severable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. **YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH CONTAINS THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST CRAZY EGG, ITS AGENTS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS AND/OR ASSIGNS IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND NOT USE OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR A CLIENT SITE.**
    
16. ### Miscellaneous; Applicable law and venue
    
    1. #### Excuse
        
        Crazy Egg shall be excused from performance hereunder to the extent that performance is prevented, delayed or obstructed by causes beyond its reasonable control.
        
    2. #### Survival
        
        This Agreement (including any amendment thereto) represents the complete agreement between us concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to reflect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
        
    3. #### Choice of Law and Forum
        
        With the exception that the enforceability of Section 15 (Arbitration; Dispute Resolution), which is governed both procedurally and substantively by the FAA, and except for such provisions regarding Personally Identifiable information under this Agreement or the Policy as may be subject to the GDPR; Data Protection Act 2018 (United Kingdom); and/or the Federal Data Protection Act of 19 June 1992 (Switzerland), this Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., without reference to its conflict of law principles. In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules, and regulations, and California law, rules, and regulations, California law, rules and regulations shall prevail and govern. Except to the extent that arbitration is required in accordance with Section 15 (Arbitration; Dispute Resolution) above, any action or proceeding relating to a Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Los Angeles County, California. Accordingly, each party agrees to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Los Angeles County, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall not apply to this Agreement. The Crazy Egg Script and Crazy Egg Technology are controlled by U.S. Export Regulations, and may not be exported to or used by embargoed countries or individuals.

        When you visit the Website or send emails to us, you communicate with us electronically and consent to receive communications from us electronically.

        via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt. A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default.
        
    5. #### Transfer of Rights
        
        You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights hereunder without Crazy Egg's prior written consent, and any such attempt is void. The relationship between Crazy Egg and you is not one of a legal partnership relationship, but is one of independent contractors. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
        
    6. #### Headings
