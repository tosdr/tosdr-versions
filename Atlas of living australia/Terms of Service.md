Terms of Use
============

### Introduction

By using this Atlas website and the Content available on and through it, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Use and the [Privacy Policy](https://www.ala.org.au/terms-of-use/privacy-policy/ "Privacy ppolicy").

Content that you access through the Atlas website may also be subject to specific terms and conditions imposed by a data provider (Data Provider Terms). These Data Provider Terms may include certain licences to use the Content, such as [Creative Commons licences](http://creativecommons.org.au/learn/licences).

The Data Provider Terms and the Terms of Use form the legally binding agreement between you, the Atlas and/or the data provider. If there is any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Data Provider Terms then the Data Provider Terms will prevail, but only to the extent that it applies to the particular Contents and to the extent necessary to resolve any conflict.

We may change these Terms of Use or a data provider may change their Data Provider Terms at any time without giving you notice, so please check them each time you visit the Atlas website.

### Terminology

The ‘Atlas’ means the Atlas of Living Australia project and in the context of the agreement between you and the Atlas that these Terms of Use represent, the Atlas is the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO – [www.csiro.au](http://www.csiro.au/)) as the legal entity representing and responsible for the Atlas project.

**You/user** – means you as a  website user, Content/Data user, or Content/Data provider.

**Data provider** – means an individual or organisation that makes Content available on or via the Atlas website.

**Atlas website** – means the  website with the URL [www.ala.org.au](http://www.ala.org.au/) (or any URL replacing it or containing it within the URL including but not limited to [spatial.ala.org.au](http://spatial.ala.org.au/)) and associated web services, internet publishing tools, software, tools etc.

**Content** – means contributions or content; includes, but is not limited to, multimedia such as videos, sound files, photos, other images, music; textual material such as reviews, annotations, comments, forum and blog postings, information; biodiversity related information such as species names, morphology, taxonomy, behaviour, habitat, annotations, occurrence/sighting data, geospatial/location data, records, metadata; databases, datasets. Content may also include or be referred to as Data as the context requires or as set out in an ALA Data Provider Agreement although Data is intended to be primarily the biodiversity related information outlined above.

### Registration

In order to submit or use Content on the Atlas website or to utilise certain Atlas services or software you may be required to register to establish an account/user profile with the Atlas.

When registering, a genuine email address must be provided.

The Atlas recommends that you register using a pen name, nickname or pseudonym as your login name. You must not impersonate another living person or registered user. The Atlas may refuse registration of users whose suggested login names are considered inappropriate by the Atlas.

In some cases the Atlas may ask you to provide your real name or other identifying or contact details – such personal information will be managed in accordance with the Atlas [Privacy Policy](http://www.ala.org.au/about-the-atlas/terms-of-use/privacy-policy/ "Privacy Policy").

You will ensure that any registration information you give to the Atlas is accurate, correct and up to date.

The Atlas will not accept a registration that the Atlas suspects is being made by or on behalf of someone who has been suspended for violation of these Terms of Use.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your password(s). You are therefore responsible for everything done or submitted using your account.

If you become aware of any unauthorised use of your account, you should notify the Atlas immediately on [support@ala.org.au](mailto:support@ala.org.au).

The Atlas may lock, restrict and/or delete your registration or account if you breach these Terms of Use. User accounts locked or de-activated for breach of these Terms of Use may be re-enabled at the discretion of the Atlas director.

### Contributing or uploading Content

You are free to make available, use or publish your Content elsewhere.

You warrant that you own or created the Content or have the necessary rights, licenses or permissions to make the Content available on the Atlas website.

You will make reasonable efforts to ensure your Content is accurate at the time you collected or created it or made it available on the Atlas website.

At this stage of development of the Atlas website you should avoid providing sensitive data, eg threatened species locations, quarantine or biosecurity sensitive information.

At the time of adding your Content you should nominate the type of licence which will apply to your Content and how data users can use it. You can select from a number of options, primarily Creative Commons licences. For more information see  FAQ Licensing or [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org.au/learn/licences).

b)      make available the Content and derivatives in accordance with the ALA Terms and a [Creative Commons – Attribution 3.0 Australia](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en) licence.

Neither you nor the Atlas will seek to assert any intellectual property rights over this public domain Content.
