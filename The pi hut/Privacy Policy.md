We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.  
  
We collect Device Information using the following technologies:  

* “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
