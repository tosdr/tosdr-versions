ClustrMaps Ltd. is the holder of US Patent 7,801,950 ("System for analyzing and visualizing access statistics for a web site") which protects the fast dot-clustering algorithm and the use of a dual-purpose image (our thumbnail map widget) that both performs the visitor tracking and also depicts a faithful representation of visitor locations.

  
  

### Terms of Service ("TOS")

  

By clicking on the checkbox labelled "I have read and agree to the ClustrMaps Terms of Service" or by clicking a button labelled "Make my map" or "Register" or equivalent where provided (annotated with the phrase "_Clicking accepts Terms & Conditions_"), and by using any service, website, HTML or JavaScript code of ClustrMaps Ltd. (hereafter "ClustrMaps services"), including both free and paid-for services, and/or by placing ClustrMaps HTML code on your web site(s) or web page(s), you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following terms of use. Please review the following terms carefully, including this entire web page listed at [http://www.clustrmaps.com/legal](https://clustrmaps.com/legal)

If you do not agree to these terms, you should not use this site or any ClustrMaps services. The term "ClustrMaps" or "us" or "we" or "our" refers to ClustrMaps Ltd, the owner of the ClustrMaps family of web sites and the ClustrMaps services. The term "you" refers to the user or viewer of the ClustrMaps family of web sites and the ClustrMaps services.

  
  

**The ClustrMaps website is available only to individuals who are at least 16 years old**

  
  

### Description of Service

  

ClustrMaps is a combined hit counter, visitor tracker and geographic visualization tool. We provide some HTML that you copy into a web page or 'blog sidebar'; the HTML includes a link to a thumbnail map image generated by us; when that image loads, it increments a counter on the ClustrMaps site and, when the map is updated (daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on your traffic) it shows the locations of all the visitors to your page since the beginning of a specific time interval; clicking on that thumbnail map image reveals a larger world map display.

  

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new ClustrMaps properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that ClustrMaps assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings.

  

In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the Internet/World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access Web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the Internet/World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device.  

### Acceptance of Terms of Service and Your Obligations

You agree to the terms and conditions outlined in this Terms of Service ("TOS") with respect to our site (the "Site"). This Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between us and you, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties and understandings with respect to the Site, the content, products or services provided by or through the Site, and the subject matter of this Agreement.

  

In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or ClustrMaps has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, ClustrMaps has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).

  

To use the ClustrMaps service, you will be given some HTML code to put on the web page(s) you wish to track. The code will show a small 'thumbnail map' on your page(s) and you agree to display this thumbnail map on your page(s) in a place where a majority of visitors can see and notice it, at the very least by scrolling through the page.

  

You acknowledge and agree that your web site information (name, URL, traffic counts, etc.) may be utilized by ClustrMaps to create lists of member sites, lists of top sites, and to otherwise promote the service. ClustrMaps retains all ownership and all rights to this site content, logo, software, databases, reports, and information. ClustrMaps' services are provided "AS IS".

  

We own the data on visitors to your web site that we collect, and we provide data to you as a service. You can use the data we provide for any legal purposes. We will use the data in compliance with our privacy policy.

  

You acknowledge and agree that the page(s) on which you have embedded ClustrMaps HTML code conform(s) to the following requirements, and that failure to conform to these requirements may result in a 'flagging', 'warning' or 'termination' process, as described below:

  

* Does not exceed the visit limits expressed in our table of products, displayed at [http://www.clustrmaps.com/](https://clustrmaps.com/products.htm), or such other increased limits as shall be mutually agreed between you and us.
* Does not knowingly crash browsers.
* Does not falsely generate hits to your page(s).
* Is the same page (URL) as the URL specified when you signed up to your ClustrMaps account, in other words that URL points to the page being counted. The URL must point to your domain and not to someone else's site. Please contact us if you have any special circumstances.
* Does not include or link to software containing viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, or malware.
* Does not infringe the intellectual property, privacy or any other rights of any third party.
* Does not contain anything which is unlawful, abusive, libellous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit, indecent, harassing or threatening.
* Does not promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age.
* Does not promote or incite violence.

  

### Flagging and Warning

  

Failure to conform to the requirements as expressed above may result in a graded series of steps by us, including

  

* 'flagging' (where we note in our internal database that a potential violation, such as exceeded limits, has occurred);
* 'warning' (where we send a notification by email and/or alter the thumbnail map image as deemed appropriate by us, requesting that the user reconsider the requirements and/or upgrade to a larger-scale ClustrMaps service as appropriate); or
* 'termination' (as specified below).

  
  

We will make our best endeavours to regard 'visit limit' (excessive counter) violations in light of the erratic nature of Internet traffic, and acknowledge that isolated 'peaks' may well occur, so will monitor such peaks accordingly and consider violations to occur only when the limit has been exceeded consistently for a certain consecutive number of days or weeks, as determined by us from time to time.  

### Termination

  

We reserve the right to remove any site from any of our services at any time without notice.

  

If this agreement is terminated by us or by you for any reason, you agree to remove our code from all web pages under your control.

  

You agree that ClustrMaps, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password, account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service, and remove and discard any Content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if ClustrMaps believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the TOS. ClustrMaps may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this TOS may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that ClustrMaps may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that ClustrMaps shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.

### Privacy statement

  

**ClustrMaps Ltd**is the sole owner of the information collected on this site and through facilities described in the Description of Service above. We will not sell, share, rent, or give away such information, above and beyond what is already visible in the public domain through our sites and services, with the possible exception of aggregate information that does not include any personally identifiable information, or such information as may be required to comply with due process of law. In cases where such 'due process of law' is involved, we will assess and deal with the legal implications and advise any affected users of our services accordingly.

  
  

### Use of email addresses

  

In order to use this service, a ClustrMaps user must first provide their name and email address, in addition the web address ('URL', or Uniform Resource Locator) of the site on which they wish to display visitor locations. This information is used by ClustrMaps to send out your first login password, and in case we need to contact ClustrMaps users about changes to the Service or to the Terms of Service or to provide information updates and news that we may wish to supply from time to time. It is not used for any other purpose, and will not be passed on to any others.

  
  

### Security

  
  

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, ClustrMaps can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. We make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Your ClustrMaps account is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Remember to sign out of your ClustrMaps account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence.

  
  

### Internet tracking

  

Like most web servers on the Internet, we also log some information sent by your web browser when it requests a web page, including the numerical Internet ('IP') address (typically of an internet service provider or hosting service rather than an individual user's computer), date and time, and the page requested. _We also obtain this information from the web browser of everyone who visits the web page in which you have embedded a ClustrMaps thumbnail image._ It is generally impossible for us to identify a user from this information. The logs may be analysed from time to time to study usage and to help us improve the site's organization, performance, and usefulness. The IP addresses that we obtain from visitors to your site (i.e. the web page in which you have embedded a ClustrMaps thumbnail image) is used to update our maps on a regular basis, i.e. to put a fresh 'dot on the map' for each new visitor to a web site that uses ClustrMaps.

  
  

### Cookies and third-party advertising

  

A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser, typically to provide historical information (e.g. so you do not have to re-set preferences when you re-visit a site, or to enable an electronic âshopping cartâ to remember which items you have selected when you move to a new page on a site).Â  To understand the possible usage of cookies on ClustrMaps pages, it is important to distinguish between two kinds of ClustrMaps items (thumbnail (âwidgetâ) maps vs full web pages, and two kinds of cookies: (a) 'first-party' cookies (in our case, that means cookies provided by ClustrMaps and originating from our servers at clustrmaps.com) vs (b) 'third-party' cookies (provided by others such as advertisers that you may see on certain pages on the ClustrMaps site, particularly those pages displaying large maps).

  
  
We do **not** allow third-party cookies to be used on thumbnail maps but we may use first-party cookies, i.e. cookies set by the clustrmaps.com servers, on certain thumbnail maps \[only in the case of 'code option A' with JavaScript\] and also our site generally, in all such cases to facilitate our own analytics, advertising or affiliate reward schemes. In addition, on our own web pages (e.g. large map pages, and the ClustrMaps site generally) third-party cookies may be used by third-party advertisers and advertising networks to help provide ads about goods and services of interest to you. In such cases information is provided in an anonymized, aggregated form and does **not** include any personally identifiable information, for example name, address, email address, or telephone number. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). The most relevant and high-profile situation pertinent to ClustrMaps users may be obtained by visiting the Google âPrivacy policy for Google ads and the Google Content Networkâ page at [http://www.google.com/privacy\_cookies.html](http://www.google.com/privacy_cookies.html) , and the Google Privacy Center Advertising and Privacy page page at [http://www.google.com/privacy\_ads.html](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html)

  

Web browsers are typically set up to accept cookies by default, but you can easily reset your own browser to reject cookies or to let you know when a cookie is being sent. Further information about privacy and third-party cookies, including how to block them, may be obtained from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP\_cookie#Privacy\_and\_third-party\_cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Privacy_and_third-party_cookies)
