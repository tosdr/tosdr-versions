#### Issue of tickets

1. With respect to tickets sold by us, we cannot confirm the price of any tickets until such time as you complete your order and your credit/debit card will not be charged until the order has been processed.
2. When we have confirmed your booking by e-mail to your registered e-mail address, we will send your tickets or ticket collection number to you using the method you selected when you made your booking.
3. On receipt of your tickets we would ask that you check to ensure they are correct and contact Customer Support on 03457 000 125 if your tickets do not match the information you provided at the time of booking.

#### Getting your tickets

1. We offer a range of methods to get your tickets. The particular options offered for your booking may differ depending on various factors, including ticket type, train operator, method of purchase and whether or not there is sufficient time to reliably post your tickets.

a) UK Standard â We will dispatch tickets by Royal Mail 1st Class post to the address you specify during the delivery process. You should ensure that the address provided is correct.

b) Next day delivery â We will dispatch tickets by Royal Mail Special Delivery GuaranteedÂ® to the address you specify during the delivery process. You should ensure that the address provided is correct. You will need to sign for the tickets upon delivery.

c) International post â We do not send tickets to overseas addresses.

d) Collecting tickets at the station â For many bookings we allow you to collect tickets from a range of stations. You must allow sufficient time to collect your tickets before boarding the train. You must have your ticket collection reference, and (unless stated otherwise) the credit/debit card used to make the purchase as identification. You should note any special collection instructions given during the booking process, for example the station opening hours. If you are unable to collect your tickets (for example due to the ticket machine(s) being out of service) then you should contact the station staff for further assistance. If there are no staff at the station, you should board your booked train, and make yourself known to the on-train staff at the earliest possible opportunity.

e) Print at home â For some bookings we allow you to print your own ticket. You must ensure that you print the ticket clearly on A4 paper and carry the ticket with you when you travel. Tickets are only valid when accompanied by the correct identification selected whilst making the booking. Tickets are non-transferable and you must ensure that no one else is able to obtain and/or print a copy of your ticket. Some train operating companies apply additional restrictions to the use of Self Print â you must note any additional restrictions notified during the booking process.

f) e-Tickets â For some bookings we allow you to travel with paperless tickets delivered to your mobile phone ("e-Tickets"), booked either through the Site, or via our mobile application. When booking e-Tickets via the Site, you must check that your mobile phone is compatible with our e-Tickets by downloading a test ticket where indicated prior to purchase. It is your responsibility to ensure that you carry your mobile phone on the relevant journey and that your phone is charged, functional and that you are able to display the ticket for inspection when you travel. Due to the wide variety of mobile phone handsets and networks we are unable to offer technical support or assistance. You may incur data usage charges from your mobile phone operator for downloading an e-Ticket. You should check with your network provider as to what charges may apply. For identification purposes you must also carry the credit/debit card used to make the booking (If e-Tickets have been booked for more than one passenger, all passengers should travel together and the lead passenger must carry the credit/debit card used to make the booking). We shall not provide duplicate or replacement e-Tickets. The e-Ticket must be stored on your mobile phone until the date and time of travel and such safekeeping shall be your responsibility. e-Tickets are non-transferable. By purchasing an e-Ticket, you agree to cooperate with the train inspector and let him/her clearly view the ticket on your mobile phone and you acknowledge that you may be requested to hand over your mobile phone voluntarily for inspection. If you do not produce your ticket or hand over your mobile phone upon a request to do so by the train inspector, the train inspector shall be entitled to consider that you are travelling without a ticket. It is your responsibility to ensure that your mobile phone has sufficient battery life that you are able to show the ticket at any time during your journey. Some train operating companies apply additional restrictions to the use of e-Tickets â you must note any additional restrictions notified during the booking process. Your mobile phone must be switched on to use it to travel. You should also check that you have enough battery on your phone to complete your journey. If it runs out of battery in the middle of a journey, you may have to pay the appropriate fare or could face paying a penalty fare.

g) Smartcard â For some bookings we allow your ticket to be delivered to your Smartcard. If you are using an existing Smartcard you must ensure that you correctly enter your Smartcard reference number â we cannot amend this after payment has occurred. You must carry your Smartcard with you when you travel. You must ensure that you validate your Smartcard at the start and end of your journey by using either the stand-alone validators or ticket barriers as applicable. Some train companies apply additional restrictions to the use of Smartcards â you must note any additional restrictions notified during the booking process.

#### Changes, cancellations and refunds

1. Changes to the date and time of a ticket may be permitted depending on the type of ticket and availability of alternatives, but exchange may not be available for certain ticket types. Refunds will depend on the type of ticket and conditions applicable to it and may not be available for certain ticket types.
