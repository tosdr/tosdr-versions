If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, unless you request a telephonic or in-person hearing. The arbitration hearings for U.S. residents will be held in New York, New York. If this location is not convenient for you, please let us know and we will work to determine a mutually convenient location.

If the arbitrator rules against us, in addition to accepting whatever responsibility is ordered by the arbitrator, we will reimburse your reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs up to a maximum of $5,000, regardless of who initiated the arbitration. In addition, if the arbitrator rules in our favor, we will not seek reimbursement of our attorney’s fees and costs, regardless of who initiated the arbitration unless the arbitrator finds some or all of your claims to be frivolous or to have been brought in bad faith.

You and we agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged, the proceedings, the arbitrator’s decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, the enforcement of an award, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US FOR CLAIMS THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL BE CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
