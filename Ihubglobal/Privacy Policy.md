**Privacy Policy**
==================

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains IHub Global, Inc.’s (“IHub Global,” “we” “us” or “our”) privacy practices relating to the collection and use of information that may identify you and covers information collected from any source including, for example, through its websites (collectively, the “Site”), and any smartphone, device or other electronic applications or tools, through any social media platform (together, the “Electronic Platforms”), emails, text messages, direct messages, or other communications whether electronic or written, or from any third party such as a contractor acting on IHub Global’s behalf (all of the above is referred to collectively as the “Resources”).

It is IHub Global’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect, subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and, if you receive services from IHub Global, the Host Agreement (“Host Agreement”) or any other agreements between you and IHub Global (together, “Terms of Use”), as any of the above may be amended from time to time. In addition, various Resources of IHub Global may include different terms or policies, and you should review any such terms and policies carefully, as they will control your use of that Resource. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is a part of, the Host Agreement and any other Terms of Use. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings ascribed to them in the Host Agreement. By providing us any information or accessing one or more Resources, you agree to the following provisions as final and binding.

If you do not agree to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, including having your Personal Information (as defined below) used in any of the ways described in this Privacy Policy, do not provide us with your information.  Please note, however, that if you don’t provide us with your information, you may not be able to obtain certain Services described in the Host Agreement or features of our Site.

IHub Global may update this Privacy Policy from time-to-time in our sole discretion by posting such revised Privacy Policy on the Site.

It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes each time that you use the Site and/or the Services or provide us information. Use of the Site or the Services by you following our posting of a new Privacy Policy on our Site constitutes your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as modified and will apply to all information received after the Effective Date of the modification.  In the event we materially change the way in which we use your Personal Information that we previously collected, we will provide you with notice and ask you to affirmatively accept the new uses.

This Privacy Policy applies to the processing of personal data of individuals wherever located including those in the European Union. If you are located in the European Union, if the processing of your data is subject to the laws of a member state of the European Union by virtue of public international law, if your information is otherwise governed by European Union Law, or if the processing activities of IHub Global are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the European Union or the monitoring of individuals’ behavior that takes place within the European Union, please review carefully the “General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)” section below for more information regarding your rights and our activities relating to your personal data. If you are a resident of California, please review the “California Residents’ Privacy Rights” and the “Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act” sections below for additional information regarding your rights and our activities relating to your personal data. If the GDPR or California sections are applicable to your information, then other sections in this Privacy Policy still may apply to you but are subject to (and considered modified by) those sections.

This section is applicable to residents of California. If you are a resident of California, you have certain rights described below. The following do not apply to individuals who do not live in California on a permanent basis.

* RIGHTS PROVIDED BY CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1798.83

A California resident who has provided personal data to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (a “California Customer”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal data, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal data was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal data that were disclosed. California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by mailing us at 1903 Robalo Drive Vero Beach Florida 32960 or emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://kiriptofun.ihub.global/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

The above rights are separate from rights that California residents may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).

As such, you may make a request regarding our use, handling and protection of your Personal Information by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://kiriptofun.ihub.global/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”)**
------------------------------------------------

Terms in this section are to be understood in a manner consistent with GDPR including the definitions of such terms in the GDPR. Such terms may have a different definition or meaning in other portions of this Privacy Policy because GDPR may not apply to those sections.

**Processing Purposes and Legal Bases:**

IHub Global processes your Personal Data for the lawful purposes, and under the legal bases, set forth above.

**Onward Transfer:**

IHub Global will not disclose Personal Data to a third party except as stated below:

We may disclose Personal Data to subcontractors and third-party agents. Before disclosing Personal Data to a subcontractor or third-party agent, we will obtain assurances by contractual agreement from the recipient that it will: (i) transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) ascertain that the subcontractor or third-party agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the GDPR; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that subcontractors and third-party agents effectively process the personal information transferred in a manner consistent with the organization’s obligations under the GDPR; (iv) require subcontractors and third-party agents to notify the organization if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the GDPR; (v) upon notice, including under (iv), take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (vi) provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with subcontractors and third-party agents to the Supervisory Authorities upon request.

The Personal Data is processed for purposes specified herein and will only be processed consistent with the purposes described herein. We will request only the minimum amount of information required to perform the applicable Services and/or to comply with legal requirements and will retain such information only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or for compatible purposes, such as to provide additional Services, to comply with legal requirements, or to preserve or defend our legal rights.

**Right of Access to your Personal Data**

Data Subjects have the right to access the Personal Data an organization holds about them. If such Personal Data is inaccurate or processed in violation of the GDPR, a Data Subject also may request that Personal Data be corrected, amended, or deleted. When we receive Personal Data, we do so on behalf of the individual submitting such Personal Data.  To request access to, or correction, amendment or deletion of, Personal Data, Data Subjects should contact our Data Protection Officer.  We will cooperate with all reasonable requests to assist Data Subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR.

**Choice**

Data Subjects have the right to opt out of (a) disclosures of their Personal Data to third parties not identified at the time of collection or subsequently authorized, and (b) uses of Personal Data for purposes materially different from those disclosed at the time of collection or subsequently authorized.  Data Subjects who wish to limit the use or disclosure of their Personal Data should submit that request to our Data Protection Officer. We will cooperate with Data Subjects’ valid instructions regarding Data Subjects’ choices.

**Security:**

See “Confidentiality and Security” below for more information about our security practices.

**Transfers to the United States from the European Union:**

In using the Site, your Personal Data will be transferred to the United States, which is not recognized as a country having adequate safeguards for the protection of Personal Data. IHub Global may rely on Article 49 of the GDPR for transfers of data collected from Data Subjects in the EU and EEA. Transfers may be made to IHub Global if the Data Subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer after having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers. Additionally, we transfer data as necessary for the performance of a contract between you as the Data Subject and IHub Global as the Controller, to data processors who have an agreement with us that includes protecting your privacy and the security of your data, and in cases where your Personal Data is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in accordance with your requests.

We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with Services we offer to our partners. Please read the Cookie Policy below for more information.

Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
