Certain third parties collect personal data for their own purposes as controllers. In such a case, their own rules for the processing of personal data shall apply.

7\. YOUR RIGHTS

You can exercise all your rights mentioned below, including your right to erasure of personal data and the withdrawal of your consent, by sending a request to us via email at [\[email protected\]](https://ftmo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), alternatively you can use our contact details in Section 1 of this Privacy Policy. There are no specific words that you must use in your request, but please be specific enough, so we can help you with your request (e.g. identify yourself, specify the right you wish to exercise, what action you wish us to take, details of what personal data you want erased/deleted, etc.)

In connection with the processing of personal data you have the following rights:

* **Right of access to personal data**

You can ask us at any time to send you a confirmation as to whether or not your personal data are being processed. If we process your data, we will provide you with further details on the processing. If you request it, we will also provide you with a copy of the personal data processed. Please note that the first copy is free of charge, but later copies will be provided for a small fee.

* **Right to rectification of personal data**

If we process your personal data inaccurately, you can notify us of this fact, and we will rectify the inaccurate personal data without undue delay. If you register on the Website, you will be able to rectify and amend your personal data yourself by editing your user account.

* **Right to erasure of personal data (“right to be forgotten”)**

You have the right to obtain from us the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay in the following cases:

* If the data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which we have collected or otherwise processed them;
* If you withdraw your consent to their processing and, at the same time, there will be no other legal ground for their processing (this only applies in the cases where we process personal data on the basis of your consent);
* If you object and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or if you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes; or
* If your personal data are processed unlawfully.

We will not be able to act on the request for the erasure of personal data if their processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with any of our legal obligations, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, for the establishment, exercise, or defence of our legal claims, or for other reasons provided for by law.

* **Right to restriction of processing**

In cases stated in article 18 of the GDPR, you have the right to obtain from us restriction of processing of your personal data for a certain period.

* **Right to data portability and to the provision of data in a machine-readable format**

In the case of automated processing based on your consent or performance of the contract, you have the right to receive the data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to have them transmitted by us to another personal data controller.

* **Right to object**

If we process personal data on the basis of our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to such processing. If you file such an objection, we will not be able to process your personal data unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests or rights and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of our legal claims.

In case we process your personal data for marketing purposes about our products and services, we will terminate the processing without undue delay upon receipt of the objection. In such a case, we will no longer be able to send you offers of our products and services.

* **Right to withdraw consent**

If processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on the consent given before its withdrawal.

* **Right not to be the subject of automated decision-making**

Except where processing is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract, where this is permitted by applicable law, or based on your express consent, you have the right not to be the subject of any decision which is based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly affects you to a significant extent.

* **Right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority**

If you believe that we are processing your data in violation of the relevant legal regulations, you can lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. Based on our registered office, our relevant supervisory authority is The Office for Personal Data Protection with its address at Pplk. Sochora 27, Prague 7, postcode 170 00, Czech Republic, or email [\[email protected\]](https://ftmo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
