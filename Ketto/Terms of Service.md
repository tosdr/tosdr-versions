16. Ethical Image Posting Terms:
    ============================
    
    1. Obtain Permission: You shall make sure you have permission from the people depicted in the images you show in your campaign and to use their likenesses. If the people in the images are minors, you shall take the permission of their parents or legal guardians. In each case, images should be uploaded only when you have consent from the people depicted or their parents/guardians, as the case may be.
        
    2. Informed consent: Many people may not understand the concept of crowdfunding and how photos and videos will enable them to raise funds for their cause. You must explain how the images and stories will be used and should show examples to clarify this. It must be made clear that the images will be used widely and internationally. No promises about limiting usage should be made. Further, no financial or other incentive should be offered to the people whose images and videos are used, in order to obtain their consent.
        
    3. Authenticity: You should always show a true and accurate account of the ways in which people live. Authenticity is the key to upholding our reputation; never use images that make people look more desperate or powerless than they are. You should always portray the real emotions of the people. Ketto does not encourage manufacturing fake vulnerability for the sake of emotional appeal. For instance, if a parent does not want to cry, or fold their hands while making a donation appeal, do not force them to do so. Manipulation of images in post- production or their alteration/enhancement using artificial intelligence or other digital means is strictly prohibited if it negatively affects image authenticity.
        
    4. Child protection issues: You must be mindful of child protection issues. Kindly adhere to the following while shooting children's pictures.
        
        * Nudity: You will not take or use images that show children naked from the waist down, or older female children from the waist up. We will not set up images to make children look more vulnerable.
            
        * Manipulation: It is vital that your images show reality and are not set up or manipulated to make a situation look worse than it is. For instance, you will not ask the child to fold their hands, say words suggested by you, or instruct them to cry on camera for a donation appeal. You will also make sure that at no point is the child is asking for funds, any funding appeal is strictly limited to the parents or guardians.
            
        * Privacy: Be mindful of using children's real or full names alongside their images, and assess if such use can cause harm (e.g., if the child has a disease that causes social stigma). In such cases, you may use the child's first name only. Also, publishing a child's location (e.g., the name of their village) should be re-evaluated.
            
    5. Use respectful and appropriate images: Choose images that are respectful and appropriate for all audiences. Do not use images that are violent, sexual, or discriminatory in any way. The images you publish should also comply with the laws of the land, and should not be indecent, obscene, misleading, objectionable, portray or focus on ailments or deformities egregiously, or otherwise demean an individual or group.

        ==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
        
        Ketto will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Ketto at [info@ketto.org](mailto:info@ketto.org) (Subject line: "Takedown Request").
        
          
        
        To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:

    4. Counter-Notice:If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorisation from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

5. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policy
    ==================================
    
    We comply with the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) guidelines established by the Reserve Bank of India, vide notification RBI/DBR/2015-16/18, Master Direction DBR.AML.BC. No.81/14.01.001/2015- 16 and updated from time to time. The guidelines include, but is not limited to, the following salient conditions:
    
    1. Every recipient (campaign organisers on Ketto) has to verify their identity per the Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. This will include verification of their registered mobile number via a One Time Password (OTP), and one of the identification documents viz. Permanent Account Number, Aadhar Card Number, Passport etc. recognised by the Reserve Bank of India. The list of such registered documents will be updated on Ketto.org site, at its sole discretion, from time to time.
        
        The verification will be essential to withdraw funds from Ketto, and may be asked by Ketto, at its sole discretion, during the course of a campaign. Failure to comply, may result in cancellation of a fundraising campaign, and funds may be returned to donors in such a scenario.
        
        Your location as reflected on your Campaign page must match your legal residence that you submit to Ketto when you create a withdrawal request. Campaigners may not create multiple Campaigns without proof of meeting fulfilment obligations from the original Campaign. Failure to adequately fulfil Campaign obligations may result in Ketto removing the Campaign(s) and seeking reimbursement of Campaign funds raised, including by using third-party collections services. Only the Campaigners shall be permitted to collect Campaign funds.
        
        Campaigners are responsible for collecting and remitting any taxes on Contributions, and any taxes due in connection with Campaigners shall not use a false email address to self-fund, or contribute to, their own Campaigns; this is a violation of Ketto’s policies and Terms of Use.
        
        Ketto may attempt to verify the identity and other information provided to us by Campaigners, and we may delay, withhold, reverse or refund any Contributions or other amounts without notice or liability in the event we are unable to verify any such information to our satisfaction. Campaigners’ eligibility is subject to Ketto’s review of the fulfilment status of prior crowdfunding obligations.
        
        Tax authorities may classify funds raised on the Website or Application as taxable income of the Campaigner and any beneficiary who will receive funds directly from the applicable Campaign. Ketto will ask for the personal account number / tax identification number (PAN) of Campaigners and any beneficiaries so that we may report taxable income to the relevant tax authorities. Note that Personal Account Number / Tax Identification Number (PAN) shall be collected from donors who wish to avail tax benefit under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act.
        
    2. For contributors on Ketto.org, only standard channels of payment - verified credit or debit cards, net banking, UPI ID or cash (up to limits allowed by the RBI) - will be allowed. In case of cash payments, all payments above INR 24,999 have to be furnished with the Permanent Account Number of the contributor.
        
        Recipients (campaign organisers, whether individuals or organizations) will comply with foreign exchange rules as under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 & FCRA.
        =========================================================================================================================================================================
        
        The recipients acknowledge and agree that Ketto does not verify the recipients’ compliance with applicable law and it is the responsibility of the recipient to procure the necessary approvals and do the necessary compliance before they withdraw the foreign funds received for the campaign. By asking to withdraw the foreign funds its understood by Ketto that the recipient has completed the necessary documentation.
        
    3. AML policies will be updated time to time at the sole discretion of Ketto.
        
6. Termination
    ===========
    
    You agree that Ketto, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Services and remove and discard any content within the Services, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Ketto believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use.
