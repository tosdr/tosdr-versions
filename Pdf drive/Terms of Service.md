PDF Drive may provide users with free and paid services. Payments can be made on a one-time or regular basis depending on tariffs, selected by the user.

You may cancel your membership at anytime, and cancellations will be effective immediately. You will lose any remaining access.

Except when required by law, PDF Drive shall be under no obligation to issue refunds under any circumstances. All fees are non-refundable, even if your subscription is terminated before its expiration. You authorize PDF Drive to charge you all subscription fees for the duration of the term agreed to at the time of purchase. In the event that PDF Drive determines that you are entitled to a refund of all or part of the fees you paid, such refund shall be made using the payment method originally used by you to make your purchase.

PDF Drive will begin billing your payment method for regular subscription fees corresponding to your subscription plan plus any applicable tax. To view the specific details of your subscription plan, log on at https://www.pdfdrive.com/auth/login and click “Account Settings” once you are logged on to the PDF Drive website. We will continue to bill your payment method on a regular basis for your membership plan until you cancel. You may cancel your membership at anytime. We offer a number of subscription plans. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered plans or to decease the downloads per month to which you are entitled under a particular plan. Unless otherwise stated differently, your “Billing Cycle” refers respectively to subscription that you chose upon registration.

By starting your PDF Drive membership, you are expressly agreeing that we are authorized to charge you a membership fee for your Billing Cycle, any applicable tax and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the PDF Drive Services to the payment method you provided during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your account information). As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your payment method, where applicable. The membership fee will be billed at the beginning of your membership and on each renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership if regular subscription was chosen. For example, if you became a paying member on January 31st and you chose monthly payment, your payment method would next be billed on February 28th. We may also periodically authorize your card in anticipation of membership. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email or prominently at the PDF Drive website. If you want to use a different Payment Method please contact PDF Drive support by visiting https://www.pdfdrive.com/ and clicking on “Contact. If your Payment Method reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the service beyond that date constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing that Payment Method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. Your PDF Drive membership will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your membership or we terminate it. You must cancel your membership at least one day before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next monthly, biannual or annual membership fees to your Payment Method.

We will also post a notification that the Privacy Policy has been amended prominently on our Web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and under which conditions we will disclose it to anyone.

We use contact information i.e. your email address to help us efficiently perform account tasks (changing passwords, retrieving lost passwords), to deliver the services you have requested, to perform quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses, and to contact you in connection with any orders that you have placed with us. No other use of your financial information will be made except to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request, or judicial order.

Cookies : A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive that contains non-personal information. These cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited. They also allow you to personalize your pages, and optimize your experience at our sites. We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit our sites, which of our web pages they visit, and how long they stay there. This information helps us figure out which of our web features are highly successful and which sites might need improvement. You can disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but allow you to disable them. Disabling cookies may prevent you from properly using the Services or accessing the site.

Sessions : "Session IDs" allow us to identify a particular user across multiple web page requests. This Session ID is maintained within your cookie file, where possible. If cookies are not enabled, or if the user's internet browser program does not support cookies then PDF Drive will place the Session ID in the requested web page. This allows the end user to avoid having to continually re-enter certain information such as account name and password for every web page request. This Session ID expires whenever the user closes their internet browser.

Tracking : Many of our web pages also contain special electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "gifs") that allow us to gather only non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate information about visitors to our sites. PDF Drive (through itself or third parties) uses this technology to collect and accumulate anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the experience of people visiting our web sites and, along with other information you provide, customize your future visits and improve our web sites. For example, we capture data on the type of browser used, operating system software (e.g. Windows 95 vs. 98 or Macintosh), cookie preferences (whether the user has them turned on or off), and search engine keywords (what key words did a visitor use to get to our site). We also record number of visits, paths taken, and time spent on sites and pages within PDF Drive's web sites. Please keep in mind that none of this information is personally identifiable and that we only distribute this information to internal staff at PDF Drive and to partners that have signed confidentiality agreements with us. Any information that we do share with partners reflects overall web site or Internet usage trends, not individual.

IP Address : Each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also use your IP address to restrict the access of your account to broader users.

Storage : You understand and agree that PDF Drive stores and processes your information on computers located in Germany, and by providing any data to PDF Drive, you consent to the transfer of such information to Germany. When you a delete a file from your PDF Drive account, no link will remain between you and that file. Deleted files may stay cached in PDF Drive servers to save bandwidth in case other people request them.

You expressly understand and agree that PDF Drive and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners, licensors and licensees shall not be liable to you for any punitive, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if PDF Drive has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (a) the use or the inability to use the PDF Drive services; (b) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services; (c) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (d) statements or conduct of any third party on the PDF Drive services; or (e) any other matter relating to the PDF Drive services.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features augmenting or enhancing the current PDF Drive Services, including the release of new PDF Drive properties, shall be subject to these TOS. You understand and agree that the PDF Drive Services are provided "AS-IS" and that PDF Drive assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to post or store any user communications or personalization settings. You further understand that PDF Drive Services may be interrupted and PDF Drive and the entities providing hosted servers shall not be liable for interruptions. You are responsible for obtaining access to the PDF Drive website and the PDF Drive Services, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with your subscription to the PDF Drive Services as hereinafter described. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the PDF Drive Services. You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the PDF Drive Services, including your postings or content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations of sections 19 and 20 may not apply to you.  
 

XV. NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES

You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this TOS, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.  
 

XVI. NOTICE

PDF Drive may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the TOS, including by but not limited to email, regular mail, SMS, MMS, text message, postings on the PDF Drive Services, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter developed. Such notices may not be received if you violate this TOS by accessing the PDF Drive Services in an unauthorized manner. Your agreement to this TOS constitutes your agreement that you are deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the PDF Drive Services in an authorized manner.  
 

XVII. GENERAL INFORMATION

Entire Agreement. The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and PDF Drive and governs your use of the PDF Drive Services, superseding any prior version of this TOS between you and PDF Drive with respect to the PDF Drive Services. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other PDF Drive Services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.  
 

XVIII. CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM

You and PDF Drive each agree that the TOS and the relationship between the parties shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the Republic of Seychelles, without regard to its conflict of law provisions and that any and all claims, causes of action or disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to the TOS, or the relationship between you and PDF Drive, shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in the Republic of Seychelles. You and PDF Drive agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts mentioned above, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.

Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of PDF Drive to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.

No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability. You agree that your PDF Drive account is non-transferable and any rights to your PDF Drive ID or contents within your account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted.  
 

XIX. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action by you arising out of or related to use of the PDF Drive Services or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

Titles. The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
