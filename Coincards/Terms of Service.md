**Terms and Conditions:**
-------------------------

STUFF TECHNOLOGIES INC. USER AGREEMENT (this **“Agreement”**)

**This Agreement shall be effective starting on June 9, 2023**

\* Last updated: June 9, 2023  

**STUFF TECHNOLOGIES INC. USER AGREEMENT**

**This Agreement, the Site and the Services are for customers who are based in the United States of America and Canada.**

This is a contract between you and Stuff Technologies Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of Canada. Stuff Technologies Inc. owns and operates a network of independent websites under the “Coincards” brand and trademark in a number of different countries. Each website is segregated by its own domain and operates independently of each other.

References in this Agreement to **“Stuff Technologies”**, **“Coincards”,   “we”**, **“our”** or **“us”**, are to Stuff Technologies Inc. and references to **“you”** or **“your”** are to the person with whom Stuff Technologies enters into this Agreement.

By registering for an account on Coincards.com or any of our associated websites, APIs, or mobile applications (collectively the “**Site**“) or by using the Site, you agree that you have read, understood, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, as well as our Privacy Policy.

We refer to the services described and defined below, collectively as the **Services**.

#### **1\. ELIGIBILITY**

Each Site under the Coincards brand is intended only for use by residents of the country for which that site is marketed. Coincards will not guarantee the usage of our products in any region/country outside of the specific country in which the products are purchased. Coincards will not guarantee the usage of our products by users who make purchases with retailers while outside the specific country the card has been purchased for or while using a virtual private network (“VPN”) or the onion router (“TOR”) connection. All orders by customers who do not reside in the specific country are subject to their own risk; all processed orders are not eligible for exchange or refund. Purchasing Gift Cards from a country in which you do not reside via one of the Sites will be considered a violation of this Agreement and may result in account suspension and removal of access to the Site.

#### **2\. SERVICES**

**2.1 Services.**

The following services (the “**Services**“) may be provided to you by Coincards:

1. the processing of digital currency transactions via a third-party; and
2. the issuance of electronic or physical gift cards, prepaid debit cards or mobile top-ups (the **“Gift Cards”**).

**2.2 Fees.** Stuff Technologies may charge a fee to perform the Services. The fees may differ per Gift Card. Any fees charged for Services are indicated on the page corresponding to each Gift Card.

1. **Payment and Processing.** All prices are listed in the local currency of the specific country listed on the respective Site. Currency conversion will be done at the time of checkout. Coincards accepts Bitcoin (**“BTC”**) & select other cryptocurrencies (**“Altcoins”**), the identity of which may change from time to time. Coincards may also offer select third-party integrations with independent services. All payment processing occurs via an external third party, therefore Coincards does not guarantee the processing times and conversion rates of its transactions. By using the Services, you explicitly absolve Coincards and its associated entities and individuals from any liability in association with your use of the Site.

(1) We process all orders after 2 confirmations on the appropriate blockchain. Some orders may require manual intervention and approval, in which cases we will strive to fulfill these orders within a maximum of 8-12 hours of receiving payment. Very large order volumes may take extra confirmation times and processing may be as long as 48 hours. We make no guarantee as to the timeline within which any payment is processed.

(2) We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time if your payment is made from a wallet that is considered custodial.  Custodial wallets are wallets in which the user is not in control of their own funds; the user does not hold the private keys. This includes, but is not limited to, wallets held at exchanges.

(3) We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time if the payment which is sent for the order is less than the amount required, as indicated on the payment page. If your order is underpaid, whenever possible, Coincards will adjust the amount of the available balance on the card to match the amount paid rounded down to the nearest dollar. If a smaller card denomination is not possible, you will be contacted and issued a refund to the digital currency address of your choice, minus any miner fees required to initiate the refunding transaction. Underpaid orders are manually processed or rejected by staff and all calculations are based on current market conditions at the time of intervention.

(4) We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time if the payment which is sent for the order has arrived past the expiration time allowed on the Site’s invoice. If your order is paid late, whenever possible, Coincards will make every effort to complete the order in full. If the exchange rates of the applicable currency have decreased and fulfilling your order at the paid exchange rate is not possible, Coincards will adjust the amount of the available balance on the card to match the current exchange rates, rounded down to the nearest dollar. If a smaller card denomination is not possible, you will be contacted and issued a refund to the digital currency address of your choice, minus any miner fees required to initiate the refunding transaction. Orders paid late are manually processed or rejected by staff and all calculations are based on current market conditions at the time of intervention.

(5) All transactions on the Site are final and we do not issue refunds. Any refunds issued by Stuff Technologies are at its sole discretion and the issuance of a refund to one customer does not bind Stuff Technologies to issue a refund to another customer or to the same customer for a separate transaction. When Stuff Technologies issues a refund, it is done in BTC regardless of the digital asset used to initially process the transaction. By using the Services, you agree that should a refund be issued, you are willing to accept such refund in BTC and will provide a BTC refund address for this purpose, regardless of the original purchasing currency. Refunds will be made based on the original BTC exchange rates at the time of purchase and you agree that Coincards is not responsible for fluctuations between BTC and Altcoin exchange rates. You will have 30 days from Coincards’ written agreement to issue a refund to claim your refund. All refunds which are agreed to, for which no valid BTC address has been provided within 30 days will be considered abandoned funds and forfeited to Stuff Technologies.

#### **3\. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION**

**3.1. Registration of Coincards Account.**

**3.2 Identity Verification.** You agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime and permit us to keep a record of such information. You may need to complete certain verification procedures before you are permitted to start using the Services and to access specific Services and the limits that apply to your use of the Services may be altered as a result of information collected on an ongoing basis.

The information we request may include certain personal information including, but not limited to, full name, date of birth, age, nationality, gender, signature, utility bills, photographs, phone number, home address, and/or e-mail address. In providing us with this or any other information that may be required, you confirm that the information is accurate and correct, and you agree to keep us updated if any of the information you provide changes. We will treat this information in accordance with the data protection provisions herein and in the Privacy Policy.

**WE MAY REQUIRE YOU TO WAIT SOME AMOUNT OF TIME AFTER COMPLETION OF A TRANSACTION BEFORE PERMITTING YOU TO USE FURTHER THE SERVICES AND/OR BEFORE PERMITTING YOU TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS BEYOND CERTAIN VOLUME LIMITS.**

**3.3 Consent.** By opening a Coincards Account, you provide your explicit consent to us providing the Services to you. You can withdraw this consent at any time by closing your Coincards Account.

#### **4\. TRANSACTIONS LIMITS AND ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE**

**4.1 Transactions Limits.** The use of all The Services is subject to a limit on the volume, stated in CAD or other fiat currency or digital currency, you may transact or transfer in a given period (e.g. daily). Please see **Appendix 3** for further details. Your transaction limits may vary depending on your payment method, verification steps you have completed, and other factors. We reserve the right to change applicable limits as we deem necessary. If you wish to raise your limits beyond the posted amounts, you may submit a request at [\[email protected\]](about:blank).

**4.2 Enhanced Due Diligence.** We may require you to submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide records, and arrange for meetings with Coincards staff if you wish to raise your limits (**“Enhanced Due Diligence”**). We reserve the right to charge you costs and fees associated with such Enhanced Due Diligence although if we intend to do so, we will notify you in advance so that you can decide whether you wish to proceed with the request. In our discretion, we may refuse to raise your limits, or we may lower your limits at a subsequent time even if you have completed Enhanced Due Diligence.

#### **5\. SUSPENSION, TERMINATION, AND CANCELLATION**

**5.1 Suspension, Termination and Cancellation.** We may: (a) refuse to complete, or block, cancel or reverse a transaction you have authorised (b) suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Services, and/or (c) deactivate or cancel your Coincards Account with immediate effect for any reason, including but not limited to where:

1. we reasonably believe that we need to do so in order to protect our reputation;
2. we are, in our reasonable opinion, required to do so by applicable law, regulation or any court or other authority to which we are subject in any jurisdiction;
3. we reasonably suspect you of acting in breach of this Agreement;
4. we reasonably suspect you have breached our policies outlined in **Appendix 1**;
5. we have concerns that a transaction is erroneous or about the security of your Coincards Account or we suspect the Services are being used in a fraudulent or unauthorized manner;
6. we suspect money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime;
7. use of your Coincards Account is subject to any pending litigation, investigation, or government proceeding and/or we perceive a heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your Coincards Account activity; and/or
8. you take any action that may circumvent our controls such as opening multiple Coincards Accounts.

**5.2** If we refuse to complete a transaction and/or suspend, restrict or close your Coincards Account, and/or terminate your use of the Services, we will (unless it would be unlawful for us to do so) provide you with notice of our actions and the reasons for refusal, suspension or closure, and where appropriate, with the procedure for correcting any factual errors that led to the refusal, suspension or closure. In the event that we refuse to complete a transaction and/or suspend your Coincards Account we will lift the suspension or complete the transaction as soon as reasonably practicable once the reasons for refusal and/or suspension no longer exist. However, we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a transaction at the same price or on the same terms as the suspended, reversed, or cancelled transaction.

**WE MAY SUSPEND, RESTRICT, OR TERMINATE YOUR ACCESS TO ANY OR ALL OF THE SERVICES AND/OR DEACTIVATE OR CANCEL YOUR COINCARDS ACCOUNT, WITHOUT REASON BY GIVING YOU TWO MONTHS’ NOTICE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR DECISION TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS, INCLUDING LIMITING ACCESS TO, SUSPENDING, OR CLOSING YOUR COINCARDS ACCOUNT, MAY BE BASED ON CONFIDENTIAL CRITERIA THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY PROTOCOLS. YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE THE DETAILS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY PROCEDURES TO YOU.**

**WHETHER OR NOT YOU USE AN ACCOUNT TO USE THE SERVICES, ANY SUSPENSION, RESTRICTION OR CANCELLATION MEASURES WE TAKE MAY EXTEND TO THE IP ADDRESSES YOU’VE USED TO ACCESS THE SITE IN THE PAST.**

#### **6\. LIABILITY**

**6.1 Indemnification.** You agree to indemnify us, our affiliates and service providers, and each of our, or their, respective officers, directors, agents, employees and representatives, in respect of any costs (including attorneys’ fees and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) that have been reasonably incurred in connection with any claims, demands or damages arising out of or related to your breach and/or our enforcement of this Agreement including without limitation your breach of the parameters set in Appendix 1, or your violation of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any third party.

**6.2 Limitations of Liability.** Our total aggregate liability to you for any individual claim or series of connected claims for losses, costs, liabilities or expenses which you may suffer arising out of, or in connection with, any breach by Coincards of this Agreement shall be limited to a maximum aggregate value of the subject transaction(s), in CAD, at the time the transaction(s) took place.

**6.3 Limitation of Loss.** In addition to the liability cap at set out above, in no event shall we, our affiliates or service providers, or any of our or their respective officers, directors, agents, employees or representatives, be liable for any of the following types of loss or damage arising under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise:

1. any loss of profits or loss of expected revenue or gains, including any loss of anticipated profits and/or any actual or hypothetical losses, whether direct or indirect, even if we are advised of or knew or should have known of the possibility of the same. This means, by way of example only (and without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence), that if you claim that we failed to process a transaction properly, your damages are limited to no more than the CAD fiat value of the subject transaction(s), and that you may not recover for any “loss” of anticipated profits or for any actual losses made as a result of the failure to transact;
2. any loss of, or damage to, reputation or goodwill; any loss of business or opportunity, customers or contracts; any loss or waste of overheads, management or other staff time; or any other loss of revenue or actual or anticipated savings, whether direct or indirect, even if we are advised of or knew or should have known of the possibility of the same;
3. any loss of use of hardware, software, or data and/or any corruption of data; including but not limited to any losses or damages arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy, defect or omission of digital currency price data; any error or delay in the transmission of such data; and/or any interruption in any such data; and
4. any loss or damage whatsoever which does not arise directly as a result of our breach of this Agreement (whether or not you are able to prove such loss or damage).

**6.4 Applicable Law.** The limitation of liability in this section is subject to any obligations that we have under applicable law and regulation, including our obligation to exercise reasonable care and skill in our provision of the Services. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit our liability resulting from our fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence, deliberate misconduct, for death or personal injury resulting from either our or our subcontractors’ negligence.

**6.5 No Warranties.** The Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, with no further promises made by us around availability of the Services. Specifically, we do not give any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and/or non-infringement. We do not make any promises that access to the Site, any of the Services, or any of the materials contained therein, will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or error-free.

We make no representations about the accuracy, order, timeliness, or completeness of digital currency price data available on the Site or through third parties. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that transactions are processed in a timely manner but we make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing which is dependent upon many factors outside of our control.

**6.6 No Liability for Breach.** We are not liable for any breach of this Agreement, including delays, failure in performance or interruption of service, where they arise directly or indirectly from abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all efforts to the contrary, nor are we liable where the breach is due to the application of applicable laws, regulations and policies.

#### **7\. SITE AVAILABILITY AND ACCURACY**

**7.1 Access & Availability.**Access to the Services may become degraded or unavailable during times of significant volume or network congestion. This could result in the inability to buy or sell for periods of time and may also lead to support response time delays. We do not guarantee that the Site or the Services will be available without interruption.

We shall not be liable for any losses resulting from or arising out of transaction delays.

**7.2 Website Accuracy.** Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site, the Site may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors.

In an effort to continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including without limitation information regarding our policies, products, and services. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site are your sole responsibility and we shall have no liability for such decisions.

Links to third party materials (including without limitation any websites and applications) may be provided as a convenience but are not controlled by us. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any aspect of the information, content, or services contained in any such third-party materials accessible or linked to from the Site.

When you contact us, please provide us with your name, e-mail address,  , and the transaction on which you have feedback, questions, or complaints (if applicable).

**8.2 No Compensation.** If you, or any other party on your behalf, give Coincards any feedback (including ideas or suggestions for enhancements or improvements) about the Site or the Services, then Coincards and its successors, assigns and licensees may use and commercialize the feedback without providing any compensation to you or any other person.

**8.3 Arbitration and Jurisdiction.** All disputes, controversies and claims between the parties arising under, out of, in connection with, or in relation to this Agreement, the subject matter of this Agreement and the resulting relationship between the parties will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to the National Arbitration Rules (as amended, superseded or replaced from time to time) of the ADR Institute of Canada Inc. (the **“Institute”**) by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with those rules, to the extent that the rules do not conflict with this section. The arbitration will be private and confidential and will be administered by the Institute. If the Institute is not operative, the arbitration will proceed ad hoc and be governed by the Arbitration Act (British Columbia). The place of arbitration will be Vancouver, British Columbia, and the language used in the arbitration will be the English language. Any arbitration award is final and binding and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction for the enforcement of the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this section, either party may seek preliminary or temporary injunctive relief and other remedies from the courts of British Columbia sitting in Vancouver to avoid irreparable harm or to preserve the status quo, and the parties hereby irrevocably submit and attorn to the original and exclusive jurisdiction of those courts in respect of all of those matters and any other matter that is not properly subject to arbitration pursuant to this section.

1. notify Stuff Technologies as soon as possible by e-mail at: [\[email protected\]](https://coincards.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
2. continue to provide accurate and up to date information to us throughout the duration of the Security Breach; and

**10.3 Safety and Security of Your Computer and Devices.** We are not liable for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses or other malicious code that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack.

**11.3 Merchant Issues/Cancelled Gift Cards.** While Coincards will work within our power to help any clients who have issues redeeming Gift Cards sold by Coincards.com, Coincards is not responsible for any instances in which a merchant terminates a gift card balance or a client’s account due to the merchant’s own policies or risk management policies.

Trademark Usage Guidelines
--------------------------

#### Introduction

CoinCards’ trademarks and brands are CoinCards intellectual property and are among our most valuable assets. In order to preserve and protect these brands, it is essential that they are used properly. Follow these Guidelines for using CoinCards’ trademarks and brands properly in all communications, documents, and electronic messages.

These Guidelines apply to CoinCards employees, customers, affiliates, partners, licensees, outside vendors, and other third parties. You may reference CoinCards’ products and services using the CoinCards trademarks, so long as such references are: (1) truthful, fair, and not misleading, and (2) comply with these Guidelines, which may be modified from time to time by CoinCards in its sole discretion. The CoinCards trademarks and brands should never be used in a way that could cause anyone wrongly to believe that your products or services are offered, endorsed, or sponsored by CoinCards, or any of its affiliated entities.

#### Terms and Conditions

**Trademark Notices**

Properly designate the status of CoinCards’ trademarks by using the correct trademark symbol (® or ™) reflecting CoinCards’ ownership of particular marks as set forth below. Also include an attribution of CoinCards’ ownership in the following format: “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a trademark of CoinCards”

* In letters, memos, press releases, white papers, advertising, slides, foils, video, and  
    other multimedia presentations:
    
    * Properly designate (with ® or ™) all of CoinCards’ trademarks at the most prominent use (usually a headline) and again on the first occurrence in copy; and
    * In the case of presentation graphics, trademarks should be designated with the proper trademark symbol on each page, slide, and foil.
* In newsletters, magazines, and publications containing multiple articles:
    * Properly designate (with ® or ™) all of CoinCards’ trademarks on the first occurrence in the document, in headlines and on the first occurrence in every article in which they are used.
* In brochures, annual/quarterly reports, books, technical documentation, and other bound documents:
    * Properly designate (with ® or ™) all of CoinCards’ trademarks on the first occurrence in the document, in headlines, and on the first occurrence in text.
* In all charts or graphs, properly designate trademarks (with ® or ™).
* On all packaging, always use the trademark symbol in every reference.

**Trademarks are Singular Adjectives, Not Verbs and Should Not be Made Possessive**

Use the CoinCards trademarks only as adjectives followed by the appropriate generic product or service noun describing the relevant product or service (e.g., “the CoinCards® referral program platform is awesome!”). CoinCards trademarks should not be used in plural or possessive form or as verbs.

**References to CoinCards**

When CoinCards is used to refer to our company, “CoinCards, a division of Stuff Technologies Inc.”, rather than as a brand of product or services, then the rules for proper usage change slightly. Unlike trademarks, company names are proper nouns; they can be used in the possessive form and do not need to be followed by a generic term. Neither the ™ nor ® symbol should accompany references to CoinCards as a company.

Example:

Correct: CoinCards, a division of Stuff Technologies Inc., is now offering a referral program.  
Incorrect: CoinCards®, a division of Stuff Technologies Inc. is now offering a referral program.

**Ownership Assertion**

Do not assert rights over any CoinCards brand or mark, whether by incorporating a CoinCards brand into your own product or service names, trademarks, logos, company names, or domain names or seeking a trademark or domain name registration for any term that includes a CoinCards brand.

**CoinCards Logo Use**

Do not make unlicensed use of CoinCards logos, such as the logos listed below. Third party use of CoinCards logos requires a license or written permission from CoinCards. If you are interested in obtaining a license to use a CoinCards trademark or logo, contact us to discuss your proposed use.

**Style of Use**

When using CoinCards’ trademarks: (i) use our Logos exactly as they appear below, and do not alter or distort their appearance in any way, for example, by adding your own design elements or changing the font, colors, or size; (ii) allow for clear space around our Logo; and (iv) maintain the legibility of our Logos and keep them sharp, clear, and well-produced. When using our Word Marks, you may not change their appearance by abbreviating them, incorporating them into acronyms, changing their spelling, using them in parts, or using improper capitalization.

**No Trademark Bidding**

Unless expressly permitted in an agreement between you and CoinCards, you may not bid on a CoinCards trademark (or any variant or extension thereof) as a keyword on any search engine, or use a CoinCards trademark (or any variant or extension thereof) in any form of paid advertising including, but not limited to, paid social and display advertisements.

**No Tarnishment**

You may not use a CoinCards trademark in a disparaging or degrading manner.

**CoinCards Logos**

The following is an illustrative, non-exhaustive list of logos and trademarks owned by CoinCards. Because this list of logos and trademarks and their status could change over time, including as we add new products and services, please review this section in these Guidelines periodically. Please note that the absence of a product or service name or logo from the list below does not constitute a waiver of CoinCards’ trademark or other intellectual property rights in that name or logo.
