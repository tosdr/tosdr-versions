Security Cameras
----------------

![Photo from Victoria Times-Colonist 2015](https://www.bctransit.com/wp-content/uploads/725/623/CCTV.jpg)

BC Transit is installing closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras on buses across the province. The CCTV cameras helps deter inappropriate behavior on buses and provides another tool for investigation if an incident occurs.

Video and audio recording equipment is being installed on 376 conventional buses (27 feet and longer) in the current fleet, acquired in 2006 and later. All new medium-duty and heavy-duty conventional buses will have the equipment ready-installed upon delivery.

The installation of the CCTV cameras follows a proof-of-concept period in Victoria and Kamloops in 2015-16. The proof-of-concept showed that the cameras provide a positive benefit to enhance security and safety including evidence to ensure successful conclusions for security investigations.
