****2\. What Information Does the Company Collect and How?**

We may collect several types of information from and about users of our Services, including information: (a) by which you may be personally identified, such as name, postal address, email address, telephone number or any other identifier which is deemed personal information under various laws, rules, and regulations applicable to this Privacy Policy (“Personal Information”); (b) that is about you but individually does not identify you; and (c) about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access the Services, and usage details. We collect this information (i) directly from you when you provide it to us; and (ii) automatically as you navigate through the Service. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies and other tracking technologies.

* * **Account information:** Any information about you when you register for an account or otherwise engage with the Services such as your name and email address you provide during account creation, and your payment info, company name, phone number, title and physical address when you convert to a paid account.

You agree and acknowledge that by submitting such information that you have the authority and necessary consents to provide such information.
    * **Application data:** Any data that you add to any interactive features of the Services(such as cards, comments, etc.) is stored in our systems. Additionally, when you use any of our applications, we store some usage analytics, the directory, folder and file names on your device where you store your code, and any crash reports sent from your client.
    * **Service telemetry and usage data:**  To improve our users’ experience with our Services, as you navigate through and interact with our Services, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including, without limitation: (a) telemetry data and details of your use of the Services, logs, location data and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Services; (b) information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address (including geolocation), operating system, product version, and browser type; and (c) your preferences, such as language selection.

You may choose not to share your location details with us by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings.  For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer. 
    * **Cookies:** We use “cookies” when you use or access any of our browser-based Services. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive or smartphone, to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to login a password more than once, thereby saving you time. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any of your personally identifiable information e. For further information, visit [https://www.aboutcookies.org/](https://www.aboutcookies.org/). You can set your browser not to accept cookies, however, in some cases, some of our Service features may not function as a result.

**4\. Is Personal Information About Me Secure?**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us.

We ask you not to share your access credentials with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website or other users. 

**Third Party Links:** The Services may contain links to other third party sites that are not controlled or owned by the Company. Please be aware that the Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects information.

We currently do not change our tracking practices in response to DNT Settings in your web browsers. To determine whether any of the third-party services the Company uses honor the “Do Not Track” requests, please read their privacy policies.  
  
  
**7\. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may revise this Privacy Policy at any time and will post the most current version on our website. If we feel any change is significant, we will notify users of our services.

Lawful basis for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.

* **Contractual Necessity:** We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service or End User License Agreement with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services.

**How and With Whom Do We Share Your Data?**

We share Personal Data with our affiliates, vendors, third party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service, or our End User License Agreement. These parties include:

* Payment processors
* Fraud prevention service providers
* Hosting service providers
* Co-location service providers
* Telecommunications service providers  
      
    

We also share information with third parties when you have given us consent to do so (as indicated at the point such information is collected). You may choose to make use of third-party add-ons in conjunction with certain Services. Third-party add-ons are software written by third-parties to which you grant access privileges to your content (which may include your Personal Data). When access is granted, your content is shared with the third-party. Third-party add-on policies and procedures are not controlled by the Company even though the third-party add-on may be available through the Services. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection or use of your data by third-party add-ons, and we urge you to examine the privacy policies governing third-party add-ons.

We also share Personal Data when we believe it is necessary to:

* Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies
* Protect us, our business or our users, for example to enforce our Terms of Service or End User License Agreement, prevent spam or other unwanted communications and investigate or protect against fraud
* Maintain the security of our products and services  
      
    

Furthermore, if we choose to buy or sell assets, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party, and we would share Personal Data with the party that is acquiring our assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.

We do not sell your Personal Data, nor do we share your Personal Data with third-parties for their marketing purposes (including direct marketing purposes) without your permission.

**How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?**

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you are a customer. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation.  
  
Afterwards, we retain some information for marketing and promotional activities, unless you have opted out of such promotions.

**What Security Measures Do We Use?**

We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity. **What Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Personal Data?**
