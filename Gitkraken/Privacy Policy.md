    * **Cookies:**¬†We use ‚Äúcookies‚Äù when you use or access any of our browser-based Services. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive or smartphone, to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to login a password more than once, thereby saving you time.
