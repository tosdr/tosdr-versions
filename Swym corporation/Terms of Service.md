    * Client’s Responsibilities.

Client shall prevent unauthorized access to, or use of, the Services, and notify Swym promptly of any unauthorized access or use. Client shall comply with all applicable local, state, federal and foreign laws in using the Services.
    * Privacy. Client agrees:
        * to publish, maintain and abide by a privacy policy that: (i) is consistent with Client’s use of the information Client collects from individuals using the Services; (ii) allows Swym to use Customer Data as outlined in this Agreement; (iii) complies with applicable law and applicable self-regulatory principles, if any; and (iv) prominently and adequately discloses Client’s collection, use, disclosure, storage, and aggregation of any information Client collects from individuals using the Services, including with respect to Non-Public Personal Information, collected via cookies, locally-stored objects or other tracking technologies;
        * that Client will not (and will not allow any third party to) use the Platform Services or the Apps to track or collect Non-Public Personal Information without properly informing (e.g., through a privacy policy) individuals of Client’s data collection, use, disclosure, storage, and aggregation practices (and only so long as such use conforms with any of Client’s other obligations under this Agreement);
        * that Client will not do any act to render any of the above obligations and notices untrue and will not include contradictory language in any privacy policy, that Client is responsible for ensuring that no other statement in Client’s privacy policy contradicts or nullifies any of the above statements, that Client will not rely on Swym’s opinion or direction as a substitute for legal advice, and that Client will retain sole responsibility for ensuring that its conduct and policies (including Client’s privacy policy) are sufficiently protective of Client’s end users’ rights.

2. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**
    * Services Fees. All Services are available according to pricing published on the Swym Site at https://swym.it/pricing or as set forth in an applicable Subscription Order. Pricing is subject to change from time to time on a prospective basis at Swym’s sole discretion; provided however that you may terminate a Subscription Order within fourteen (14) days of receiving a price adjustment notice, and your failure to terminate this Agreement on or before the expiration of such termination period shall constitute your acceptance of the new pricing terms. Client agrees to pay all fees due with respect to Client’s use of the Services. Fees are payable in U.S. dollars. Except as otherwise specified in an applicable Subscription Order, fees are based on the Services purchased and not actual usage. Platform Services purchased cannot be decreased during the Subscription Term.
    * Payment. Payment of all fees must be made in advance by a valid credit card accepted by Swym unless other payment arrangements have been made between you and Swym. By approving a Subscription Order for the Platform Services, you authorize Swym to charge your credit card monthly, in advance, for the fees set forth in the Subscription Order. If Swym is for any reason unable to effect automatic payment via your credit card, you will be notified by email and access to the Platform Services will be disabled until payment is received. Late payments shall accrue interest of 1.5% per month, or the maximum rate allowable by law, whichever is less.
    * Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, fees do not include any direct or indirect local, state, or federal taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including value-added, use or withholding taxes (collectively, “Taxes”).

To the extent Client submits Customer Data which constitutes “personal data” of individuals subject to the privacy laws of the European Economic Area or Switzerland (collectively “EU Personal Data”), Client acknowledges that in all cases Swym acts as the processor of EU Personal Data and Client remains the controller of EU Personal Data.
* This Agreement incorporates by reference the required contractual provisions from GDPR Article 28 between controllers (i.e. Client) and processors (i.e. Swym).
* This Agreement incorporates by reference the EU Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in the Decision 2010/87/EU of February 5, 2010.

IN NO EVENT SHALL A PARTY (INCLUDING THE PARTY’S OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AFFILIATES) HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BOTH PARTIES UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS SET FORTH HEREIN REPRESENT THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT AS TO THE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. NO CLAIM MAY BE BROUGHT BY CLIENT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER THE ACCRUAL OF THE CLAIM.

1. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**
    * Agreement Term. This Agreement commences upon Client’s first access to or use of the Services and continues until terminated as set forth in this Section 9 (the “Term”).

    * Termination for Convenience. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon fourteen (14) days written notice to the other party.
    * Termination for Cause.

* No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The parties agree that there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement.
* Waiver and Cumulative Remedies.

* Force Majeure. Neither party shall be deemed in default of this Agreement to the extent that performance of its obligations or attempts to cure any breach are delayed or prevented by reason of any act of God, fire, natural disaster, accident, riots, acts of government, shortage of materials or supplies, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of such party.
* Attorneys’ Fees. If either party hereto resorts to legal action for the redress of a breach of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

You should review the Swym Site regularly. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective upon those changes being made live.
* Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and assigns; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not be assigned by Client without Swym’s prior written consent. Swym may assign this Agreement in connection with a change of control, reorganization, or sale of at least a majority of its assets or outstanding voting securities.
* Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby.
* Swym conducts vulnerability scans every 24 hours and threats are acknowledged within 24 hours.
* Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its choice-of-law principles. Any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Washington state courts and/or the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, and the parties hereby agree to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts.
