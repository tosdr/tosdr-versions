**5.     Projects.**  Among many other things, the Website and Services include functionality where (i) any User who is interested in receiving design services (each, a “**Client**”) for their specified project (each a “**Project**”) can search through User content and profiles on the Website to find a User to provide design services for the Client’s Project, (ii) the Client can through the Website messaging capability solicit a proposal for such Project (each a “**Project Request**”) from a User chosen by Client (the “**Designer**”), (iii) the Designer can send their proposal for providing their design services for the Project (each a “**Project Proposal**”),  (iv) the Designer and the Client can use the Website messaging capability to discuss and negotiate the terms of an arrangement for the Designer to provide design services for the Project, and (v) the Designer and the Client can through the Website messaging capability agree upon the terms of such arrangement by the Client accepting a version of the Designer proposal for the Project through the Website (the Designer Proposal that is accepted by the Client, an “**Accepted Proposal**”). 

a.   Each Accepted Proposal will deemed to be a legally binding contract between Client and Designer on the terms and conditions set forth in the Accepted Proposal and these Terms.  Dribbble will provide the intermediary services expressly specified in this Project Section of these Terms for the Platform Fees described below, but Dribbble will not be a party to any Project Request, Project Proposal or Accepted Proposal, and will have absolutely no responsibility for or liability related to any services rendered or to be rendered or fees or costs paid or reimbursed or to be paid or reimbursed as part of or related to any Project or any other act or omission of any User.  The relationships arranged or formed under or in carrying out this Section will be those of independent contractors.  Dribbble will be acting solely as an independent contractor intermediary; in no event will (i) Dribbble be considered to be an employer, principal or agent of Client or Designer or any other User, or (ii) either Client or Designer be considered to be an employee, principal or agent of Dribbble.

b.   The fee payable by the Client for the Project design services (the “**Project Cost**”) together with Dribbble’s Client Platform Fee (the “**Client Platform Fee**”) and the fee of the payment processor (the “**Payment Processing Fee**”), in each case, as described in the Pricing and Payment Terms, are due and payable to Dribbble through the Website pursuant to the [Pricing and Payment Terms](https://support.dribbble.com/hc/en-us/articles/25939443069335)  immediately upon the Client’s acceptance of the Designer’s Project Proposal. 

c.   As intermediary, Dribbble will hold the Project Cost until such time as (i) the Client indicates through the Website their      acceptance of a version of the Project deliverables delivered by the Designer (the “**Final Project Deliverables**”) or consent to the release of the Project Cost, or (ii)  a Dribbble determination, in its sole discretion, that Designer has fulfilled their obligations with respect to the Project (any of those three alternatives, “**Project Completion**”) or (iii) the provision below regarding Project Fee Refund applies.  

d.   If Project Completion  does not occur within the Project timeline agreed to under the Accepted Proposal, at Client’s request through the Website, Dribbble will refund the Project Cost to the Client Website Account (“**Project Fees Refund**”); _provided, however_, that (i) Client and Designer may agree through the Website to a partial refund of the Project Cost to Client and a partial payment of the Project Cost to the Designer, and (ii) Dribbble may, in its sole discretion, determine that Designer has fully or partially fulfilled their obligations with respect to the Project, and release some or all of the Project Cost to Designer, with any remainder of the Project Cost refunded to the Client. 

e.     In the event of a dispute between Designer and Client related to a Accepted Proposal, at the request of Designer or Client through the Website, a member of the Dribbble support team will engage with them to work to resolve the dispute and endeavor to get both of them to consent to the resolution through the Website, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else set forth in these Terms,  the determination of the Dribbble support team as to whether and the extent Project Completion has been achieved, and the amount of the Project Cost to be refunded to Client and/or released to Designer will be final and will prevail and Dribbble will in no case have any liability with respect thereto.  

f.    Either Client or Designer may cancel any Accepted Proposal prior to commencement of Design services by the Designer as Dribbble may, in its sole discretion, determine is appropriate.

g.   Upon Project Completion, unless the Accepted Proposal states otherwise, the Final Project Deliverables and the copyright and trademark rights thereof and therein are automatically assigned to Client, provided that it is understood that all pre-existing tools, processes, software code, programs and other works that are used by Developer to provide the Deliverables or, unless the Accepted Proposal states otherwise, that are included in any Designer deliverables will remain the intellectual property of Designer or their respective owners (collectively, “**Pre-existing IP**”), provided, however that, unless the Accepted Proposal states otherwise, to the extent that any Pre-existing IP is included in or within or embodied or disclosed by the Final Project Deliverables, to the full extent of Designer’s current or future rights in or to such Pre-existing IP, Client shall automatically have a irrevocable, fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, world-wide, non-exclusive, fully transferable and sublicensable right and license granted by Designer to use, copy, publicly perform and display, distribute, modify, and prepare derivative works based upon the Pre-existing IP if within or disclosed by the Final Project Deliverable. Furthermore, Dribbble may without payment or other consideration use or display any Final Project Deliverable for purposes relevant to marketing any Services or the Website or the operation and function of any of the Website or Services.

h.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, without limitation of any other remedies available to Dribbble or Designer, Client will have no ownership or rights in or to any Project Deliverable or any rights therein or thereto if Client’s payment of any fees to Designer or Dribbble applicable to the Accepted Proposal is [canceled](https://support.dribbble.com/hc/en-us/articles/25774097299223) , reversed or charged back without Dribbble’s written (could be by email) consent or agreement.

i.     Upon Project Completion, after a reasonable processing period, Dribbble will release the Project Cost to Designer, minus Dribbble’s Designer Platform Fee (the “**Designer Platform Fee**”), all in accordance with the Pricing and Payment Terms.

j.     Upon Project Completion, unless the Accepted Proposal states otherwise, Designer represents and warrants with respect to the Final Project Deliverables that:

                i.         the Final Project Deliverables are original works created by Designer;

               ii.         Designer has the legal right to enter into and perform the Accepted Proposal and create and deliver the Final Project Deliverables and rights therein and thereto under these Term;

              iii.         the Final Project Deliverables do not, and the treatment thereof as permitted by these Terms will not, infringe, misappropriate or violate  any third party rights, including any third party copyrights, trademarks, privacy, data protection or publicity rights or trade secret rights of any third party;

              iv.         Designer has fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to Pre-existing IP, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to the Client any required terms;

               v.         the Final Project Deliverables do not contain or install any malware or other harmful or destructive content; and

              vi.          If any stock or third party media or works not provided for or by Client are incorporated into the Final Project Deliverables, Designer holds a valid license to use the same and to include it in the Final Project Deliverables under these Terms.

The above representations and warranties do not apply to (i) any content or materials that are included in the Final Project Deliverables that are provided by or for Client or that are Client’s pre-existing trademarks, or (ii) to any aspect of the Final Project Deliverables to the extent that it is solely the result of it being based on Client instructions or requirements.

k.      Any and all determinations by Dribbble or actions or failures to act of Dribbble or the Dribbble support team relating to any Project, Accepted Proposal, Project Deliverable and/or Project Cost or other fee will be final and binding on Designer and Client, and Dribbble will have absolutely no liability related thereto. 

l.       Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else set forth in this or any other Agreement or terms in the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Accepted Proposal, the terms of these Terms will prevail, and nothing in an Accepted Proposal will be binding on Dribbble.

The place of arbitration shall be Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The number of arbitrators shall be one. Any award rendered in an arbitration is final and binding and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction for its enforcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dribbble may seek and obtain injunctive relief in any jurisdiction in any court of competent jurisdiction and you agree that these Terms are specifically enforceable by Dribbble through injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary damages.

b.     Class Action Waiver: TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S DISPUTES. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND DRIBBBLE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this arbitration section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of this section still applies. 

c.      Opt Out: You may opt out of this arbitration agreement and class action waiver. If you choose to do so, neither you nor we can force the other to arbitrate and, following efforts to informally resolve any Disputes, the claim will be brought in court. To opt out, you must notify us in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your username and the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, all sent to [optout@dribbble.com](mailto:optout@dribbble.com). You must also retain a copy of your opt-out notice.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.

**THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS 27 AND 28 ARE APPLICABLE TO U.S. CONSUMERS AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CONSUMERS IN ALL OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE CANADA:**

**27.            Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.** PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION.  
Arbitration of Disputes: For any claim, disputes, or controversy between you and us that arises out of, is related to or connected with the goods or services you acquire from or through us (individually a "Dispute" and collectively "Dispute"), you agree to first contact Dribbble at [help@dribbble.com](mailto:help@dribbble.com) to attempt to resolve the Dispute informally. We hope we can resolve any Dispute with you.  
  
In the unlikely event that you and Dribbble are unable to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after you contact us, then you and we each agree to resolve the Dispute only by and through binding arbitration with a single arbitrator. You and we further agree that the arbitration may be administered by American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA or, if an arbitration is not possible through AAA, through a similar well-recognized nationwide arbitration administration service with similar rules.  The place of arbitration shall be New York City and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The number of arbitrators shall be one. Any award rendered in an arbitration is final and binding and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction for its enforcement.  
  
The only exceptions to our agreement to arbitrate are as follows: (1) any and all Dispute related to injunctive relief and/or any dispute relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ Intellectual Property Rights (as discussed below); (b) to the extent that arbitration clauses are prohibited by applicable law in jurisdictions outside of the United States; or (c) a Dispute that meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court as a single-plaintiff claim (which you may bring in such a small claims court at your option).  
  
You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act encourages the arbitration of private disputes in an efficient manner and shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.  
  
Notwithstanding any arbitration rules to the contrary, if your Claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing. If your Claim is for more than U.S. $10,000, at the option of either party, the arbitration will be conducted at an in-person hearing.  
  
We will advance the payment of filing fees and arbitrator’s fees and expenses, with the understanding that the arbitrator will be permitted to re-allocate those costs in the award.  
  
In any arbitration, the prevailing party will not seek to recover attorney’s fees or expenses. The award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.  
  
Class Action Waiver: YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S DISPUTES. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND DRIBBBLE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this arbitration section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of this section still applies.  
  
Opt Out: You may opt out of this arbitration agreement and class action waiver. If you choose to do so, neither you nor we can force the other to arbitrate and, following efforts to informally resolve any Disputes, the claim will be brought in court. To opt out, you must notify us in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your username and the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, all sent to [optout@dribbble.com](mailto:optout@dribbble.com). You must also retain a copy of your opt-out notice.

**28.            Governing Law and Jurisdiction.** Subject to the other terms and conditions of these Terms, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms that is not subject to arbitration shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (and, to the extent controlling, the federal laws of the United States). The laws of the State of New York will govern without reference to the conflicts-of-laws rules thereof. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act will not apply to (and are excluded from the laws governing) these Terms. In addition, you agree that any claim, action or dispute arising under or relating to these Terms that are not covered by the arbitration provisions above will be brought exclusively in (and the parties will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of) the Federal or State courts in Manhattan in the City and State of New York. Nothing in the foregoing will prevent us from bringing an action for infringement of Intellectual Property Rights in any country where such infringement is alleged to occur.
