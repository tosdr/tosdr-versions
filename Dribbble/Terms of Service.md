Terms of service

Our terms of service
====================

Read our terms below to learn more about your rights and responsibilities as a Dribbble user.

Updated May 16, 2023

Dribbble Holdings Limited (the “Dribbble Group”) is comprised of several companies, which together provide tools to help the world’s designers to create, develop and promote their talents (each a “Service” and collectively, the “Services”). The companies within the Dribbble Group each act as the data controller for personal data processed in respect of their Services (each a “Group Company” and together the “Group Companies”) and referred to as “our,” “we,” or “us” below. Our Group Companies operate the Services, which include websites, software, mobile services, and applications.

This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, website, and software provided on or in connection with the Services. These terms apply to all sites to which link to these terms, including, but not limited to, dribbble.com, creativemarket.com, fontspring.com, fontsquirrel.com, and any subdomains thereof. **By using the Services, creating an account and checking the "I agree" (or similar) box, or otherwise accessing or using the Services, you (1) agree that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service (these “Terms”), and (2) also that you have read and acknowledge the collection and use of your information as set forth in our** [**privacy policy**](https://dribbble.com/privacy) **(the "Privacy Policy"), whether or not you are a registered user of the Services.**

Your use of certain Services or features of our Services may be subject to additional terms. For example, if you purchase a font or other Asset from Creative Market, purchase a font from Fontspring, or download a font from Font Squirrel, additional license terms for the font or Asset may apply (each, a “License”). Similarly, if you make a purchase through the Services, an applicable return policy may apply. If you sign up to be a seller or affiliate (e.g., on Shop and Partner terms on Creative Market or Foundry terms on Fontspring), your use of the Services in such a capacity may be subject to additional terms. If you engage in sharing content and interact with other users in our community (e.g., posting or commenting on content at Dribbble), your conduct may be subject to Community Guidelines. We may offer promotions or contests through the Services from time to time, and your participation in these may also be subject to additional terms. To the extent additional terms affect your use of the Service, those terms (including, but not limited to, the licenses and Privacy Policy noted above) are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms.

These Terms apply to all visitors, users, buyers, sellers and others who access the Services ("User(s)," or "you," or "your"). If you open an account on the Services on behalf of an organization or other entity, then (i) "you" includes you and that entity, and (ii) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.

**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AND BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND IT FULLY, BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS AND CONTROLS YOUR LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH US AND YOUR RIGHTS RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.**

PLEASE NOTE: SECTION 19 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH US. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us using our [Support Form](https://support.dribbble.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)

1. **Use of Our Service.** The Services provides creative communities where Users can share and socialize around content, maintain portfolios, search jobs, or connect with job seekers. Our services also provide a marketplace where Users can buy and sell design items, such as fonts, brushes, patterns, and other digital assets ("Assets"). Some of our Service allows for a buyer ("Buyer") to purchase limited licenses (in accordance with the applicable License) to use Assets from shops opened on the Services by independent creators ("Shop Owners"). References to "buying" or "purchasing" Assets means buying or purchasing limited licenses to those Assets.
    
    1. **Eligibility.** You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with us, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, provincial, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Dribbble Group.
        
    2. **License Terms.** As noted above, your use of any Assets is subject to the applicable License (outlined in [License Terms](https://dribbble.com/licenses/terms/general) and [Font License Terms](https://dribbble.com/licenses/terms/fonts).) We and Shop Owners offer different license types, so it is important that you carefully review the rights and restrictions of the License that applies to the Assets before you purchase a license to such Assets. In the event of a conflict between the License applicable to you and these Terms, the License will apply to the extent of that conflict.
        
    3. **Our Services.** Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable right to use the Services for your use only as permitted by the features of the Service and by these Terms. Dribbble Group reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Services and the Content (as defined below). Dribbble Group may revoke this right at any time for any reason or no reason.
        
    4. **Your Account.** Your account gives you access to the services and features that we may establish, maintain, and modify, from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users (e.g., Shop Owners, Affiliates, Dribbble Pro, Dribbble Pro Business), which may provide access to additional or different Services or features of those Services. By connecting to the Services with a third-party service (e.g., via your Facebook or Google account), you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your login credentials for that service. You are responsible for tracking all activity on your own account, and you agree to the following:
        
        1. To store all passwords and usernames securely.
            
        2. To notify us of any unauthorized use or security breach. We will not be liable for any liability, damage, cost, loss or expense caused by or in connection with any unauthorized use of your account.
            
        3. To never share login details or account access with anyone, including clients or team members, unless explicitly permitted by additional terms applicable to your account type.
            
        4. To accept responsibility for activity that occurs under your account(s).
            
        5. To never transfer, rent, "sell," or otherwise make your account available to another person.
            
    5. **Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination.** Dribbble Group reserves the right to monitor downloads and user activity to ensure compliance with the terms of these Terms and the applicable License, which we may update from time to time in our sole discretion. We further reserve the right to monitor downloads and user activity for security of our Services, fraud detection, and protection of our Users and to ensure compliance with applicable laws. We may, without notice, change the Service, stop providing the Service or features of the Service, or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice or liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of these Terms, or for no reason. We may remove or refuse to post any User Content (defined below) for any reason or no reason in our sole discretion. We will not be liable for any loss or corruption of User Content you provide to the Services. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by these Terms.
        
2. **Notifications and Emails.** By providing us with your email address, you consent to Dribbble Group using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. Subject to applicable law, we may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers ("Newsletters"). We may provide other notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, "push" mobile notifications, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by us in our sole discretion (in accordance with applicable law). We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users. We are not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. You can manage your email and notifications preferences on your account settings page. In the case of any newsletter or other marketing initiatives, you can withdraw your consent to receiving those communications and unsubscribe to those communications at any time by clicking “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of such communication or by contacting [help@dribbble.com](mailto:help@dribbble.com). Doing so may have a material impact on our ability to provide the Services to you and we are not responsible if you do so.
    
3. **Service Rules.** You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:
    
    1. Copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Services in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated "scraping".
        
    2. Using any automated system, including without limitation "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Dribbble Group servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional online web browser (except that Dribbble Group grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from our websites for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials).
        
    3. Transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited promotional email.
        
    4. Attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Services.
        
    5. Taking any action that imposes- or may impose, as we determine at our sole discretion- an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure.
        
    6. Uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Services, including through any User Content.
        
    7. Collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names and emails, from the Services.
        
    8. Using the Services for any commercial solicitation purposes, except as explicitly permitted (e.g., job boards and “Hire Me” buttons on Dribbble, operating a Shop in accordance with these Terms on Creative Market).
        
    9. Impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, engaging in fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity.
        
    10. Interfering with the proper working of the Service.
        
    11. Accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service.
        
    12. Bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content.
        
4. **User Content.**
    
    1. Some areas of the Services allow Users to post content outside of Assets for sale (which are governed by additional terms, such as our Shop Terms), such as profile information, screenshots, comments, images, files, job postings, and other content or information. Any such material a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service is "User Content". User Content includes, without limitation, logos, trademarks and service marks, trade names, and other information posted by users, which may be used by us for marketing and promotional purposes pursuant to the User Content license grant below. **You agree to abide by all other applicable terms, such as Dribbble’s Community Guidelines (which we may modify from time to time), when you post User Content and interact with other Users of the Services.** You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. We have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User's action or inaction.
        
    2. You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, your User Content. That is the case regardless of whether the User Content in question constitutes text, graphics, sound, or other media formats. By making User Content available through the Services, you represent and warrant that:
        
        1. the downloading, copying and use of the User Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;
            
        2. if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the User Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the User Content;
            
        3. you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the User Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;
            
        4. the User Content does not contain or install any viruses or other harmful or destructive content;
            
        5. the User Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
            
        6. the Content is not obscene, libelous or defamatory, hateful or racially or ethnically objectionable, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party; and
            
        7. you have, in the case of User Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by Dribbble Group or otherwise.
            
    3. **User Content License Grant.**  
        While you maintain all rights, including copyrights, that you own or control in User Content, you hereby grant the following licenses to your User Content:
        
        1. To Dribbble Group. By posting any User Content on the Services, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Dribbble Group a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Services and Dribbble Group’s business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. Dribbble Group may, but is not obliged, to cite you as the owner of such User Content in our marketing or other communications.
            
        2. To Other Users. You also hereby grant each User of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Service, as permitted through the functionality of the Services and under these Terms.
            
    4. **Additional User Content Prohibitions.** You agree not to post User Content that:

        7. contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party's trade secrets);
            
        8. contains any information or content that would violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
            
        9. contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships;

        11. promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual.
            
5. **Our Proprietary Rights.** In these Terms, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may not exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, province, territory or other jurisdiction. Except for your User Content, the Services and all materials therein or transferred thereby, including, without limitation, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and User Content belonging to Dribbble Group, other Users, and other licensors to Dribbble Group (the "Dribbble Group Content"), and all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, as between you and Dribbble Group, are the exclusive property of Dribbble Group and its licensors (including that of other Users who post User Content to the Services). Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in these Terms shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, decompile, reverse engineer, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any Dribbble Group Content. Use of the Dribbble Group Content for any purpose not expressly permitted by these Terms is strictly prohibited.
    
6. **Feedback.** You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Services, including without limitation about how to improve the Services or our products ("Ideas"). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, voluntary, and without restriction and will not place Dribbble Group under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any attribution or additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Dribbble Group does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Dribbble Group, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.
    
7. **Copyright Infringement.**
    
    1. We take claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. If you believe any materials accessible on or from our Services infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those materials (or access to them) from the Services by submitting written notification to our copyright agent designated below. In accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) (**"DMCA"**), the written notice (the **"DMCA Notice"**) must include substantially the following:  
        Your physical or electronic signature.
        
        * Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works on the Services, a representative list of such works.
            
        * Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material.
            
        * Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address).
            
        * A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
            
        * A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate.
            
        * A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
            
        
        Our designated copyright agent to receive DMCA Notices is:  
          
        Copyright Agent  
        Dribbble  
        490 43rd Street, Unit #145  
        Oakland, CA 94609  
        [help@dribbble.com](mailto:help@dribbble.com)  
          
        If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective.
        
    2. It is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Users who are repeat infringers.
        
8. **Fees and Renewals.** Pricing for certain accounts, such as paid accounts on Creative Market and Dribbble Pro accounts (collectively, “Paid Accounts”), will be provided at the time of purchase. Unless otherwise set out at the time of purchase or as agreed to by Dribbble Group, fees for a Paid Account will be billed in advance for each subscription period indicated in the description of the Paid Account (“Subscription Period”) and are non-refundable. There will be no refunds or download credits for partial months of service or for periods in which your Paid Account remains open but you do not use the Services associated with the Paid Account. Any download credits that are not used at the end of each Subscription Period will expire and new download credits, in the amount of your subscription, will be added to your account at the beginning of each new Subscription Period. The credits are not a gift and are paid for in advance solely for convenience of the customer. As such, the credits are non-transferrable to a third party, whether as a gift or for consideration.  
      
    We reserve the right to modify our billing rates at any time upon thirty (30) days written notice by posting such fee changes to the Services or through email notification to you. You will be liable to pay such modified billing rates.  
      
    Subject to your payment of applicable fees for a Paid Account, we will provide the Services to you for the Subscription Period that you have paid for such Services. At the end of the Subscription Period, your Paid Account subscription will automatically renew for an additional Subscription Period until it is expressly canceled by you as described in the “Termination” section below. If you purchase any fee-based Service, including Paid Accounts, you agree that our third party payment gateways, such as Stripe and Paypal, may store your credit or charge card or other payment information. You expressly agree that we are authorized to charge you (i) a fee for any applicable Services for which you have subscribed, billed on a basis of the Subscription Period, (ii) any other fees for the Services you may purchase, (iii) any charges for use of the Services in excess of the usage or other limits placed on your use of the Services (and you hereby consent to such charges and agree we are not required to notify you of any such charge in advance) and (iv) any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Services to the credit or charge card you provide and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. If the credit or charge card you provide expires and you do not provide new credit or charge card information or cancel your Account, you authorize us to continue billing you and you agree to remain responsible for any uncollected fees.
    
9. **Resolution Process for Transactions.** All parties share the responsibility for making sure that purchases facilitated by our Services are satisfactory and hassle-free. Our Services host the resolution process for transactions when Buyers claim that their Asset was not received, or the Asset they received was different from what was described in the product listing. We may take a more active role in ensuring transaction problems are resolved; however, you understand that we are not obligated to do so. You agree to permit us to make a final decision, in our sole discretion, on any disputes. We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover. We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used. Should you file a chargeback or dispute on a purchase you have made on the Services, we reserve the right to close your account without notice (in compliance with applicable laws and rules). Certain purchases, such as those made on Creative Market, are subject to the following [Chargeback Policy](https://support.creativemarket.com/hc/en-us/articles/236189908-Refund-FAQ-Common-Issues#chargeback), which may change from time to time.
    
10. **Fees and Paid Services.**
    
    1. **Billing Policies.** Certain aspects of the Services may be provided for a fee or other charge, such as Paid Accounts and purchase of Assets. If you elect to use paid aspects of the Services, you agree to the posted pricing and payment terms as we may update them from time to time in our sole discretion. We may cancel subscriptions without prior notice if we are unable to process payment through the provided method of payment.
        
    2. **Account Cancellation.** You may cancel your account at any time; however, should you cancel your account, you will not be granted a refund upon cancellation. In the event that Dribbble Group suspend or terminates your account or these Terms for any reason, you understand and agree that you shall receive no refund or exchange for any Credits, Asset licenses, any license or subscription fees for any portion of the Services, any content or data associated with your account, or for anything else.
        
    3. **Refund Policy:** You agree that all refunds are at the sole discretion of Dribbble Group. Dribbble Group has no obligation to refund amounts paid to license digital Assets, including but not limited to if Dribbble Group finds that the Asset has been downloaded by the User. You agree to the applicable full Refund & Exchange Policy for the Group Company from which you purchased the Asset, which we may modify from time to time in our sole discretion.
        
        1.

YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND DRIBBBLE GROUP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this arbitration section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of this section still applies.  
      
    (c) Opt Out: You may opt out of this arbitration agreement and class action waiver. If you choose to do so, neither you nor we can force the other to arbitrate and, following efforts to informally resolve any Disputes, the claim will be brought in court. To opt out, you must notify us in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your username and the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, all sent to [optout@dribbble.com](mailto:optout@dribbble.com). You must also retain a copy of your opt-out notice.
    
22. **Governing Law.** These Terms, the relationship between you and Dribbble Group and all related matters will be governed by, and construed and interpreted solely in accordance with, the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.
    
23. **THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS 22 AND 23 ARE APPLICABLE TO U.S. CONSUMERS AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CONSUMERS IN ALL OTHER JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE CANADA:**  
      
      
    
24. **Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.** PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION.  
    (a) Arbitration of Disputes: For any claim, disputes, or controversy between you and us that arises out of, is related to or connected with the goods or services you acquire from or through us (individually a "Dispute" and collectively "Dispute"), you agree to first contact Dribbble Group at [help@dribbble.com](mailto:help@dribbble.com) to attempt to resolve the Dispute informally. We hope we can resolve any Dispute with you.  
      
    In the unlikely event that you and Dribbble Group are unable to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after you contact us, then you and we each agree to resolve the Dispute only by and through binding arbitration with a single arbitrator. You and we further agree that the arbitration may be administered by American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA or, if an arbitration is not possible through AAA, through a similar well-recognized nationwide arbitration administration service with similar rules.  
      
    The only exceptions to our agreement to arbitrate are as follows: (1) any and all Dispute related to injunctive relief and/or any dispute relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ Intellectual Property Rights (as discussed below); (b) to the extent that arbitration clauses are prohibited by applicable law in jurisdictions outside of the United States; or (c) a Dispute that meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court as a single-plaintiff claim (which you may bring in such a small claims court at your option).  
      
    You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act encourages the arbitration of private disputes in an efficient manner and shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.  
      
    Notwithstanding any arbitration rules to the contrary, if your Claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing. If your Claim is for more than U.S. $10,000, at the option of either party, the arbitration will be conducted at an in-person hearing.  
      
    We will advance the payment of filing fees and arbitrator’s fees and expenses, with the understanding that the arbitrator will be permitted to re-allocate those costs in the award.  
      
    In any arbitration, the prevailing party will not seek to recover attorney’s fees or expenses. The award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.  
      
    (b) Class Action Waiver: YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S DISPUTES. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND DRIBBBLE GROUP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this arbitration section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of this section still applies.  
      
    (c) Opt Out: You may opt out of this arbitration agreement and class action waiver. If you choose to do so, neither you nor we can force the other to arbitrate and, following efforts to informally resolve any Disputes, the claim will be brought in court. To opt out, you must notify us in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your username and the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, all sent to [optout@dribbble.com](mailto:optout@dribbble.com). You must also retain a copy of your opt-out notice.
    
25. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction.** Subject to the other terms and conditions of these Terms, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms that is not subject to arbitration shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (and, to the extent controlling, the federal laws of the United States). The laws of the State of California will govern without reference to the conflicts-of-laws rules thereof. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act will not apply to (and are excluded from the laws governing) these Terms. In addition, you agree that any claim, action or dispute arising under or relating to these Terms that are not covered by the arbitration provisions above will be brought exclusively in (and the parties will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of) the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Marin, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco.

Each party will be responsible for covering their respective costs and expenses in performing their duties under these Terms, unless expressly provided otherwise herein. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms, or any portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of these Terms and the remainder of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.

Except as expressly provided herein, a party may only waive its rights under these Terms by a written document executed by both parties.
