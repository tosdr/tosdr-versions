### **As a member of the Dribbble community, you agree to the following guidelines:**

1. ### **SHOT GUIDELINES**
    

* **Only upload design work.**
    

* Don't share promotional videos, commercials, or tutorials. 
    
* Don't share anything that isn't graphic design work. For more details on what you can share on Dribbble, [head here](https://support.dribbble.com/hc/en-us/articles/25367663026839-Dribbble-Shot-Do-s-and-Dont-s). 
    
* Do not upload work or images with watermarks or other obfuscating markings. 
    
* Do not use Dribbble Shots to advertise your product or service. If you’re interested in advertising on Dribbble, you can [learn more here.](http://dribbble.com/advertise)
    
* Do not use Dribbble Shots to promote your job listing.  If you’re interested in posting a Job on Dribbble, you can [learn more here](http://dribbble.com/hiring). 
    

**Do not post inappropriate content.**

* Do not post content that is illegal, pornographic, violent, mature in content, or gratuitously or overly sexual, racist, sexist, or otherwise offensive.
    
* We realize that nudity can be a gray area. We aim to keep Dribbble PG-13.
    
* Do not post inflammatory content. For example: name-calling, preaching, ranting, stirring up controversy, or venting frustrations. 
    
* Per our Terms of Service, Dribbble has final say over whether content is appropriate.
    

**Only share work that you have permission to share.**

* Do not post work created by other designers. 
    
* Do not share content that is wholly generated by AI. When creating content with AI assistance, it is recommended to acknowledge the contribution of AI in your Shot description.
    
* Do not share work that contains copyrighted or trademarked content.
    
* Do not share work you are contractually obligated not to, for example, without client permission or under NDA. 
    

**Don't take credit for others' work.**

* Don't plagiarize work by other designers. If your work is inspired by other work on Dribbble, create a [Rebound](https://help.dribbble.com/#what-is-a-rebound). 
    
* Please link back to Dribbble when posting Dribbble content elsewhere and do not use design work without permission. 
    
* Ensure you have the appropriate licenses to use music or other stock assets in Shots.
    

**Use Shot descriptions appropriately.** 

* Do not include email addresses or websites/URLs in your Shot description or within the Shots themselves. 
    
* Please include all relevant details in your Dribbble Shot; do not share links to see more information on your portfolio website or other community site. 
    
* Do not link to your socials or contact forms within your Shot description - these can be featured on your ‘About’ page only. 
    

**Provide accurate tags.** 

* Please apply thoughtful and relevant tags to your Shot.
    
* Do not apply any tags to your Shot that aren’t completely relevant (Shots with irrelevant tags will be penalized in search results). 
    
* Do not include your username as a tag.
    

2. ### **COMMUNITY GUIDELINES**
    

**Only use social gestures for genuine engagement.**

* Do not use likes, follows, and other disingenuous social gestures to draw attention to your account. 
    
* Do not use automations (like bots or scripts) to like, save, follow, or disingenuously engage on the platform. 
    

**Comments should be constructive.** 

* Do not leave comments that are short on substance to draw attention to your own account.
    
* Do not leave links or direct people to your own work when leaving comments. 
    
* When providing criticism or feedback to other Dribbble members, be helpful, not mean. 
    

**Messages should be constructive for the recipient.** 

* Do not use messages to spam Dribbble users. Examples of spam include: 
    
    * Advertising your services or products 
        
    * Inappropriate or profane messages
        
    * Deceptive or misleading messages
        
    * Nonsense or test messages
        
    * Mass messages
        
    * Impersonating an individual or organization 
        

Consider leaving observations or questions about a Shot (Example: Nice work! What font is that? Etc.) as a comment rather than sending a message.

3. ### **ACCOUNT GUIDELINES**
    

**Personal accounts are for the work of an individual designer only.**

* User accounts may not be used to share the work of a team, collective, community or any other group of individuals.
    
* Users may not share personal accounts. 
    
* Each user may only have a single personal account and may not create multiple personal accounts for different categories of design work.  
    

**Team profiles are for design agencies and in-house design teams only.** 

* All team members must work for your agency or design team.
    
* Team owners must not receive compensation in exchange for team seats.
    

**Do not abuse profile features.**

* Do not replace your name with an email address, website URL, or keywords. For example: Dan Thornett • Logos • Branding • Graphic Design
    
* Do not include the following information in either the description or masthead image of your profile: 
    
    * Profanity, offensive content or hurtful language.
        
    * Known false information, including onsite statistics, follower counts or other misleading information. 
        

4. ### **HIRING GUIDELINES**
    

**All work inquiries on Dribbble must be for paid design work.** 

* No design contests or spec work are allowed. 
    

**Job listings must clearly define the offered role, be up-to-date and follow all other** [**Job Board Best Practices and Policies**](https://support.dribbble.com/hc/en-us/articles/24499781236503-Job-Board-Best-Practices-and-Policies)**.** 

**Do not send low-quality Hiring messages:** 

* Ensure that the designer you're contacting is a good fit for your job. 
    
* Personalize the messages you send—don't send boilerplate messages. They tend to feel impersonal and lack the detail necessary to be appealing. 
    
* Include the project or position details in your first message. Messages that don’t mention a work inquiry may not reach the designer's inbox.  
    

**Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or religion will not be tolerated.** 

### **If we find that your account or any of your Shots violate these guidelines, we’ll remove the offending content and reserve the right to suspend your account permanently.** 

_We may suspend your access to Dribbble, either temporarily or permanently, without warning or responsibility for any reason. This includes instances where we determine that you have violated any of these Guidelines, or even if there is no reason at all. We reserve the right to remove or decline to post any content for any reason, or no reason, at our sole discretion._
