Terms of Use
============

Last updated: May 07, 2015  

Thanks for using POWR Inc’s (“**POWR**”) products and services (“**POWR**"). These Terms of Use (“**TOU**”) contain the terms under which POWR and its affiliates provide their Services to you and describe how the Services may be accessed and used. Depending on which Services you use, additional terms and policies (including rules, guidelines and other similarly named documents) presented with those Services may apply (“**Additional Terms**”). Those Additional Terms become a part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. We refer to the combination of this TOU and any applicable Additional Terms collectively as these “**Terms**”. You indicate your agreement to these Terms by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance of these Terms, by executing a document that references them, or by using the Services. If you will be using the Services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization. Certain country-specific term may apply to you if you are located outside the United States.

1\. Fees and Payments
=====================

  

**1\. Fees for Services.** You agree to pay to POWR any fees for each Service you purchase or use (including any overage fees), in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Service. Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your account management page. Fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or when required by law.

**1.2. Subscriptions.** Some of our Services are billed on a subscription basis (we call these “Subscriptions”). This means that you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period is called a “billing cycle”). Billing cycles are typically monthly or annual, depending on what subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel auto-renewal through your online account management page, or by contacting our customer support team. While we will be sad to see you go, you may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription at any time, in which case your Subscription will continue until the end of that billing cycle before terminating. You may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription immediately after the Subscription starts if you do not want it to renew.

**1.3. Taxes.** Unless otherwise stated, you are responsible for any taxes (other than POWR’s income tax) or duties associated with the sale of the Services, including any related penalties or interest (collectively, “Taxes”). You will pay POWR for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If POWR is obliged to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide POWR with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority or other documentation providing evidence that no tax should be charged. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to POWR, you must provide POWR with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.

**1.4. Price Changes**. POWR may change the fees charged for the Services at any time, provided that, for Services billed on a subscription basis, the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current billing cycle of your Subscription. POWR will provide you with reasonable prior written notice of any change in fees to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the change becomes effective.

**1.5. Overage Fees**. Unless otherwise stated, any overage fees incurred by you will be billed in arrears on a monthly basis. Overage fees which remain unpaid for 30 days after being billed are considered overdue. Failure to pay overage fees when due may result in the applicable Service being limited, suspended, or terminated (subject to applicable legal requirements), which may result in a loss of your data associated with that Service.

2\. Privacy
===========

  

**2.1. Privacy**. In the course of using the Services, you may submit content to POWR (including your personal data and the personal data of others) or third parties may submit content to you through the Services (your “Content”). We know that by giving us your Content, you are trusting us to treat it appropriately. POWR’s Privacy Policy, together with any Service-specific data use policies, privacy statements and privacy notices (collectively, “privacy policies”), detail how we treat your Content and personal data and we agree to adhere to those privacy policies. You in turn agree that POWR may use and share your Content in accordance with our privacy policies.

Both POWR and Plugin Creators process Plugin Respondents’ personal information (for example, name, email address, and address) and are therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of buyers’ personal information under EU law. That means that each party is responsible for the personal information it processes in providing the Services. For example, if a Plugin Creator accidentally discloses a Plugin Respondent’s name and email address when fulfilling another Plugin Respondent’s order, the Plugin Creator, not POWR, will be responsible for that unauthorized disclosure.

**2.2. Confidentiality**. POWR will treat your Content as confidential information and only use and disclose it in accordance with these Terms (including our privacy policies). However, your Content is not regarded as confidential information if such Content: (a) is or becomes public (other than through breach of these Terms by POWR); (b) was lawfully known to POWR before receiving it from you; (c) is received by POWR from a third party without knowledge of breach of any obligation owed to you; or (d) was independently developed by POWR without reference to your Content.

3\. Your Content
================

  

**3.1. You Retain Ownership of Your Content.** You retain ownership of all of your intellectual property rights in your Content. POWR does not claim ownership over any of your Content. These Terms do not grant us any licenses or rights to your Content except for the limited rights needed for us to provide the Services, and as otherwise described in these Terms.

**3.2. Limited License to Your Content.** You grant POWR a worldwide, royalty free license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, create derivative works, make publicly available, and otherwise exploit your Content, but only for the limited purposes of providing the Services to you and as otherwise permitted by POWR’s privacy policies. This license for such limited purposes continues even after you stop using our Services, though you may have the ability to delete your Content in relation to certain Services such that POWR no longer has access to it. This license also extends to any trusted third parties we work with to the extent necessary to provide the Services to you. If you provide POWR with feedback about the Services, we may use your feedback without any obligation to you.

**3.3. Copyright Claims (DMCA Notices).** POWR Inc. responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement in accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If you believe that your work has been exploited in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify POWR’s agent for claims of copyright infringement.

**3.4. Other IP Claims.** POWR respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect our users to do the same. If you believe a POWR user is infringing upon your intellectual property rights, you may report it through our online form. Claims of copyright infringement should follow the DMCA process outlined in these Terms, or any equivalent process available under local law.

4\. POWR IP
===========

  

**4.1. POWR IP**. Neither these Terms nor your use of the Services grants you ownership in the Services or the content you access through the Services (other than your Content). Except as permitted by POWR’s Brand and Trademark Use Policy, these Terms do not grant you any right to use POWR’s trademarks or other brand elements.

5\. User Content
================

  

**5.1. User Content.** The Services display content provided by others that is not owned by POWR. Such content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. Correspondingly, you are responsible for your own Content and you must ensure that you have all the rights and permissions needed to use that Content in connection with the Services. POWR is not responsible for any actions you take with respect to your Content, including sharing it publicly. Please do not use content from the Services unless you have first obtained the permission of its owner, or are otherwise authorized by law to do so.

**5.2. Illegal and Inappropriate Content.** POWR does not allow illicit or illegal material, including but not limited to: phishing forms, spam, and unlawful pornographic material. Additionally, POWR values diversity and respect for others, and we strive to avoid hosting content which includes: hatred; violence; harassment; racism; sexual, religious, or political intolerance, or organizations with such views content that's exploitative or appears to unfairly capitalize at the expense of others Inappropriate or illegal content will be removed and accounts may be frozen. Please refer to “Acceptable Uses” for further clarity on appropriate user content.

**5.3. Content Review.** You acknowledge that, in order to ensure compliance with legal obligations, POWR may be required to review certain content submitted to the Services to determine whether it is illegal or whether it violates these Terms (such as when unlawful content is reported to us). We may also modify, prevent access to, delete, or refuse to display content that we believe violates the law or these Terms. However, POWR otherwise has no obligation to monitor or review any content submitted to the Services.

**5.4. Third Party Resources.** POWR may publish links in its Services to internet websites maintained by third parties. POWR does not represent that it has reviewed such third party websites and is not responsible for them or any content appearing on them. Trademarks displayed in conjunction with the Services are the property of their respective owners.

6\. Account Management
======================

  

**6.1. Keep Your Password Secure.** If you have been issued an account by POWR in connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for safeguarding your password and any other credentials used to access that account. You, and not POWR, are responsible for any activity occurring in your account (other than activity that POWR is directly responsible for which is not performed in accordance with the Customer’s instructions), whether or not you authorized that activity. If you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account, you should notify POWR immediately. Accounts may not be shared and may only be used by one individual per account.

**6.2. Keep Your Details Accurate.** POWR occasionally sends notices to the email address registered with your account. You must keep your email address and, where applicable, your contact details and payment details associated with your account current and accurate. Accounts are controlled by the entity whose email address is registered with the account.

**6.3. Remember to Backup.** You are responsible for maintaining, protecting, and making backups of your Content. To the extent permitted by applicable law, POWR will not be liable for any failure to store, or for loss or corruption of, your Content.

**6.4. Account Inactivity.** POWR may terminate your account and delete any content contained in it if there is no account activity (such as a log in event or payment) for over 12 months. However, we will attempt to warn you by email before terminating your account to provide you with an opportunity to log in to your account so that it remains active.

7\. User Requirements
=====================

  

**7.1. Legal Status.** If you are an individual, you may only use the Service if you have the power to form a contract with POWR. None of the Services are intended for use by individuals less than 13 years old. If you are under 13 years old or do not have the power to form a contract with POWR, you may not use the Services. We recommend that parents and guardians directly supervise any use of the Services by minors. If you are not an individual, you warrant that you are validly formed and existing under the laws of your jurisdiction of formation and that you have duly authorized your agent to bind you to these Terms.  
POWR is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 16. You must be at least 16 years old to access and use POWR and use the Services. If you are between 14 and 16 years old, you may only use the Site under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.

**7.2. Embargoes.** You may only use the Services if you are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. If you are located in a country embargoed by United States or other applicable law from receiving the Services, or are on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List, or the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, you are not permitted to purchase any paid Services from POWR.

8\. Acceptable Uses
===================

  

**8.1. Legal Compliance.** You must use the Services in compliance with, and only as permitted by, applicable law.

**8.2. Your Responsibilities.** You are responsible for your conduct, Content, and communications with others while using the Services. You must comply with the following requirements when using the Services: (a) You may not misuse our Services by interfering with their normal operation, or attempting to access them using a method other than through the interfaces and instructions that we provide. (b) You may not circumvent or attempt to circumvent any limitations that POWR imposes on your account (such as by opening up a new account to conduct a survey that we have closed for a Terms violation). (c) Unless authorized by POWR in writing, you may not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any POWR system or network. (d) Unless permitted by applicable law, you may not deny others access to, or reverse engineer, the Services, or attempt to do so. (e) You may not transmit any viruses, malware, or other types of malicious software, or links to such software, through the Services. (f) You may not engage in abusive or excessive usage of the Services, which is usage significantly in excess of average usage patterns that adversely affects the speed, responsiveness, stability, availability, or functionality of the Services for other users. POWR will endeavor to notify you of any abusive or excessive usage to provide you with an opportunity to reduce such usage to a level acceptable to POWR. (g) You may not use the Services to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or to commit an unlawful activity. (h) Unless authorized by POWR in writing, you may not resell or lease the Services. (i) If your use of the Services requires you to comply with industry-specific regulations applicable to such use, you will be solely responsible for such compliance, unless POWR has agreed with you otherwise. You may not use the Services in a way that would subject POWR to those industry-specific regulations without obtaining POWR’s prior written agreement. For example, you may not use the Services to collect, protect, or otherwise handle “protected health information” (as defined in 45 C.F.R. §160.103 under United States federal regulations) without entering into a separate business associate agreement with POWR that permits you to do so.

**8.3. Sensitive Information.** POWR does not permit the collection of unencrypted sensitive information while using the Services. You must not request sensitive information using POWR services, including POWR Form Builder. Sensitive information includes, but is not restricted to: (a) Credit or Debit card details outside of payment integrations (b) Social Security numbers (c) Passwords

9\. Suspension and Termination of Services
==========================================

  

**9.1. By You.** Refunds are issued for yearly and biennial subscriptions if cancelled within 5 days of initial purchase. Refunds are not available for monthly upgrades. Terminating a subscription mid-billing cycle will not result in a refund, unless you are an annual or biennial subscriber and are cancelling within 5 days after the initial purchase. All users who terminate mid-billing cycle will continue to have full access to their plan features until the end of the cycle when the termination takes into effect. Upgrades purchased through a third-party, such as the Wix App Market, are exempt from this policy. Refunds for upgrades purchased through a third-party cannot be issued by POWR.

The Terms of Service are displayed in the checkout process, and anyone purchasing an upgrade must agree to the terms before being able to buy a POWR upgrade.

**9.1.1 Monthly upgrades** No refunds are available for monthly upgrades. If you're not sure POWR Starter, Pro, or Business is the best option for you, please contact our support team to request a free trial prior to purchase.

**9.1.2 Annual and biennial upgrades** Refunds can be issued only within the first 5 days of a yearly or biennial upgrade being purchased.

**9.2. By POWR.** POWR may limit, suspend, or stop providing the Services to you if you fail to comply with these Terms (such as a failure to pay fees when due), or if you use the Services in a way that causes legal liability to us or disrupts others’ use of the Services. POWR may also suspend providing the Services to you if we are investigating suspected misconduct by you. If we suspend or terminate the Services you receive, we will endeavor to give you advance notice and an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. However, there may be time sensitive situations where POWR may decide that we need to take immediate action without notice. POWR has no obligation to retain your Content upon termination of the applicable Service.

**9.3. Further Measures.** If POWR stops providing the Services to you because you repeatedly or egregiously breach these Terms, POWR may take measures to prevent the further use of the Services by you, including blocking your IP address.

10\. Changes and Updates
========================

  

**10.1. Changes to Terms.** POWR may change these Terms at any time for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes in applicable law or updates to Services, and to account for new Services or functionality. Any changes will be posted to the location at which those terms appear. POWR may also provide notification of changes on its blog or via email. Changes will be effective no sooner than the day they are publicly posted. In order for certain changes to become effective, applicable law may require POWR to obtain your consent to such changes, or to provide you with sufficient advance notice of them. If you do not want to agree to any changes made to the terms for a Service, you should stop using that Service, because by continuing to use the Services you indicate your agreement to be bound by the updated terms.

**10.2. Changes to Services.** POWR constantly changes and improves the Services. POWR may add, alter, or remove functionality from a Service at any time without prior notice. POWR may also limit, suspend, or discontinue a Service at its discretion. If POWR discontinues a Service, we will give you reasonable advance notice to provide you with an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. POWR may remove content from the Services at any time in our sole discretion, although we will endeavor to notify you before we do that if it materially impacts you and if practicable under the circumstances.

11\. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability
=============================================

  

**11.1. Disclaimers.** While it is in POWR’s interest to provide you with a great experience when using the Services (and we love to please our customers), there are certain things we do not promise about them. We try to keep our online Services up, but they may be unavailable from time to time for various reasons. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND POWR DOES NOT MAKE WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OR ANY REGARDING AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY, OR ACCURACY OF THE SERVICES.
