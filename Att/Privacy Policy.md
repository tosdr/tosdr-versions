We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023:

* We’re making customer choices simpler. All customers can now select “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information,” and we’re removing the specific opt-out for External Marketing and Analytics Reports, which only share information that is already aggregated (grouped), meaning they don’t identify individuals.
* We’ve expanded our section on State Privacy Rights and Choices. It includes categories and examples of information we collect, create and share. It also explains choices available to you to manage your information.
* We’ve updated the names, descriptions and terms of our ad programs. Our “Personalized” program replaces “Relevant Advertising” and provides you offers and ads that are relevant to your interests. “Personalized Plus” replaces “Enhanced Relevant Advertising” and uses more of your information for more relevant communications to you. You can opt out or opt in at any time.
