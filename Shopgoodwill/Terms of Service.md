* A physical or electronic signature of the User.
* Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.

* Goodwill shall promptly provide you with a copy of the counter notification, and inform you that Goodwill will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days; and
* Goodwill shall replace the removed material and cease disabling access to the material in no less than 10 and no more than 14 business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless Goodwills designated Copyright Agent first receives notice from you that you have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the User from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material at our Website.

**Account Termination**

Goodwill may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate an account holder or user of our Website if he or she is a repeat infringer. If you believe that an account holder or user is a repeat infringer, please follow the instructions above to contact Goodwills DMCA Copyright Agent and provide information sufficient for us to verify that the account holder or user is a repeat infringer.

**Termination and Denial of Access**

This Agreement is effective unless and until terminated by Goodwill. If, in Goodwills sole discretion, you fail to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement, Goodwill may terminate your access to or use of this Website. In the event of termination or denial of access by Goodwill, you are no longer authorized to access our Website, and the restrictions imposed upon you with respect to material copied or downloaded, and the disclaimers and limitations of liabilities set forth in this Agreement, shall continue in force.

**Third Party Links**

This Website may include links to other Internet sites maintained by third parties (“Linked Sites). Goodwill provides Linked Sites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of Linked Sites does not imply endorsement by Goodwill of the Linked Sites. You access Linked Sites at your own risk and by accessing them, you leave this Website. Linked Sites are not under the control of Goodwill and Goodwill is not responsible for any content of any Linked Sites.

**Modifications to our Website or Services**

Goodwill reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, our Website and/or Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice in our sole discretion. You agree that Goodwill shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of our Website and/or Services.

**Your Account Information, Password and Security**

In the course of your use of our Website or Services, we may ask you for certain information, including your name, email address, mailing address and credit card information (collectively, “Account Information). If you open an account or commence any transaction of business at or on this Website, you may be required to complete the registration process by providing certain additional information and registering a username and password. Your Account Information must be up-to-date and accurate at all times. Should your information change, you must update it in your user profile. Please see our FAQs for more information on how to update your information. You agree that you are solely responsible for the accuracy and content of your Account Information. You are further responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password and also for all activities that take place under your account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security; and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each Website session. Consistent with and without limiting the scope of provisions limiting liability elsewhere in this Agreement, in no event will Goodwill be liable for any indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever resulting from the disclosure of your username and/or password or your failure to comply with this section. You may not use another persons account at any time, without the express permission of the account holder.

**Auction Bidding and Buying; Non-Paying Bidders**

New bidders (buyers with user accounts less than 30 days old) will be restricted to participating in no more than 15 active auctions at one time. As a bidder, if you have the highest bid at the end of the auction period, at or above the minimum bid price (or in the case of reserve auctions, at or above the reserve price), and your bid is accepted by the seller, YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION. Bids are not retractable except in exceptional circumstances (e.g., the seller materially changes the description of the item after your bid, clear typographical errors, or when the bidder cannot authenticate the identity of the seller). Bid manipulation is strictly prohibited. In other words, you may not bid in a way that pushes other bidders to their maximum bid, retract your original high bid, and re-bid at a small increment above the legitimate high bidder.

A Non-Paying Bidder is a person who wins the auction through the bidding process but does not follow through with the transaction and instead fails to fulfill his or her obligation to purchase the item(s) he or she won through the bidding process. The seller community of our Website is committed to notifying our staff regarding any Non-Paying Bidder. We take these situations very seriously and will record, monitor, suspend or ban any Non-Paying Bidder, or take other appropriate disciplinary, investigative or legal action, in our sole and absolute discretion.

**Product Availability and Pricing**

The inclusion of any products or Services on this Website at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or Services will be available at any time. Products may be out-of-stock, discontinued, or subject to other action by the seller. Prices are quoted in U.S. dollars, are effective for U.S. purchases only, and are subject to change at any time. Discounts are limited time offers and may not be combined with any other offers. Goodwill reserves the right to limit the quantities of any products or Services that we offer through this Website at its sole discretion. For information on shipping, please see our [Shipping Policy](javascript:void(0)).

**Product Images, Content and Specifications**

All features, content, specifications, products and prices of products and Services described or depicted on this Website are subject to change at any time without notice. All product descriptions provided by the seller are approximate and are provided for convenience only. We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. Likewise, the product images on this Website may appear larger or smaller than their actual size. While Goodwill attempts to be as accurate as possible in the product descriptions on this Website, Goodwill does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any Goodwill Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. If a product offered by Goodwill is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition pursuant to Goodwills [Return Policy](javascript:void(0)).

It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) with respect to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased form this Website. By placing an order, you represent and warrant that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.

**Return Policy**

Goodwills return and refund policy is accessible [here](javascript:void(0)) and is incorporated into this Agreement in its entirety.

**Shipping Policy and Risk of Loss**

When an order is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping adress is valid and compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on this Website. All purchases from this Website are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from this Website pass to you upon delivery of the items to the third party carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with the applicable carrier for any damaged and/or lost shipments.

**Pre-Paid Credit Cards and Gift Cards**

Terms of payment (whether PayPal, Visa and MasterCard credit cards or debit cards) vary by seller. Please refer to an items listing for a list of payment options acceptable to that particular seller. Pre-paid and gift card credit cards must have a verifiable billing address associated with them and a 3-digit security code on the back of the card to be used to pay for purchases on our Website. If your card does not have a verifiable billing address or a 3-digit security code, you will need to contact the card-issuer for instructions on how to enable the card to be used to pay for items on our Website.

If you are unable to activate the card for online purchases, you will need to use a standard Visa or MasterCard credit or debit card. Please check the item listing page carefully for payment methods accepted by the seller of the item.

With respect to any credit card use, you represent and warrant that (i) the credit card information you supply to us is true, correct and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including shipping and handling charges and all applicable taxes, if any, regardless of the amount quoted on our Website at the time of your order.
