Introduction
------------

Goodwill Industries of Orange County, (“Goodwill OC,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) is the operator of the ShopGoodwill website (Site), and we respect the privacy concerns of users of the Site. This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) and any other documents referred to in it sets forth the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, in connection with the Product will be processed by us. We are providing this Privacy Policy so that you can better understand how we collect, use, and share information that is gathered using our Product.

Our privacy practices are subject to the applicable laws of the places in which we do business, so we have added region-specific terms that only apply to customers located in certain geographic regions, or as required by applicable laws.

Linked Sites have their own personal information collection and use practices, and we are not responsible for those practices. We encourage you to read each Linked Site’s privacy disclosures to understand how your personal information is processed.
* Other Goodwill Entities. Other Goodwill entities participating as sellers on this on this Site are not directly affiliated with Goodwill OC. While we will disclose information to other Goodwill entities and sellers in order to facilitate a purchase, we are not responsible for their data collection and use practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the sellers listed on this site. This privacy policy is limited solely to Goodwill OC.
* Workforce Members and Candidates. Our processing of the personal information of job applicants/candidates and workforce members is not governed by his policy.
* Information Collected Offline. Information provided to Goodwill OC outside of the ShopGoodwill Platform is not covered by this privacy policy.
* Non-Personal Information. Our processing of information cannot be linked to an identifiable or identified individual. We may process this data for any legitimate business purpose.

### 2\. Personal Data We Collect and How We Use It

When used in this Privacy Policy, “personal information” includes information that is reasonably capable of identifying a particular individual (including through their device) either alone or when combined with information from other sources. The personal information we collect about you depends on the nature and context of your interaction with our Goodwill OC and our Site. It may also depend on various choices you make about how to use the Site, the functionality and features you choose or enable, your location, the devices you use to interact with our Site, and applicable law. The following describes the personal information we collect about you and the way we collect it.

#### 2.1 Personal Information You Give to Us

We collect the following categories of personal information you provide to us, including the following:

* Your Personal Details. For example, your first and last name, email address, phone number, physical address, job titles, and other contact information you provide.
* Account and Other Identifiers. For example, a username, screen name, handle, account ID, assigned user ID, customer number, or similar identifier that can be used to identify and user or account.
* Commercial Information. For example, your order history, auctions participated in, and payment history.
* User Content. For example, emails and text messages, photos, videos, audio recordings, customer support communications, comments/feedback, and any other content submitted by you.
* Survey data. We may contact some individuals to request participation in a survey or other general research. If you choose to take part in these, you may provide personal information, in or along with your survey responses, or in any other feedback or comments you give us.
* Messages and email data. We collect information about you when you send, receive, open, read, or otherwise engage with messages, emails, or other communications in connection with our Site, including whether you have opened or acted on those communications.
* Other Personal Information You Provide. If you provide us personal information other than that described above, we will collect it and use it for the purposes for which you provide it or other consistent purposes.
* Payment processing information. For example, the form of payment, payment card number and details, bank account number, payment service provider, and other payment information you provide. We use a third-party processor to securely collect this information on our behalf and do not store payment card information.

#### 2.2 Personal Information We Derive Through Your Use of Our Site

We and our third-party partners use cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs, pixels, internet tags, and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “tracking technologies”) to gather information when you interact with our websites, mobile apps, and email communications. We use some of these tracking technologies to help us optimize and maintain the security of our websites and your account. We also use them for compatible purposes like saving your preferences, fixing errors, and ensuring consistent service of our websites and mobile apps.

We permit third parties to use tracking technologies on our websites for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, and provide metrics on advertising effectiveness. The third parties use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our websites or on other websites.

The information we collect using these technologies includes:

* Device and Browser Identifiers. For example, an assigned user ID, IP address, or similar identifier that can be used to identify your device.
* Coarse Location Information. A general approximation of your location that is not based on global position system (GPS) information
* Browsing and Search History. Information about the content you view and searches you make on our Site(s).
* Website Log and Usage Data. Information related to our pages you viewed, the services and features you used or interacted with, your browser type and details about any links or communications with which you interacted.
* Advertising Metrics. Information about the advertisements you have viewed on our Website.

Because the “Do Not Track” browser-based standard signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance, our Website(s) currently does not respond to those signals.

#### 2.3 Personal Information We Collect From Others

We mostly collect personal information directly from you or based on your interaction with our Site. However, we also may collect personal information from third-party sources. These include our sellers of products on our Site (“Sellers”), our Business Services Providers, Marketing and Advertising Providers, government entities, our Goodwill OC affiliates, security services providers, other individuals, social media platforms, and other users of the Site.

Even if you haven’t opened an account on ShopGoodwill, your information might still be collected. Some users may choose to share information about their contacts, including their name, email address, phone number, or other information. Users may also post or comment with personal information about other users.

### 3\. What We Do with Your Personal Information

### 4\. Our Sharing of Your Personal Information

### 5\. Publicly Posted Content

Goodwill OC users may have the ability to post content to one or more Goodwill OC forums, such as chat rooms and bulletin boards. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information in any forum, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. Please take care when using these features. You may request and obtain the removal of such posted content by contacting us at Support@shopgoodwill.com and specifically identifying the content to be removed. Please be advised that any such removal does not ensure the complete or comprehensive removal of all traces of the content posted on the Goodwill OC forums.

### 6\. Data Security

We have implemented and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, no security measure is perfect, so we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

### 7\. Users Located Outside the United States

The Site is operated by Goodwill OC, and we are located and operate in the United States. By submitting personal information to us or visiting our Site, you understand that your personal information will be processed in the United States. The laws that apply to the use and protection of personal information in the United States, or other countries or jurisdictions in which we transfer or process personal information, may be different from the laws and protections in your country. Our Site and services are not targeted to individuals in jurisdictions outside of the United States.

### 8\. Your Privacy Preferences

You can control the collection and use of personal information for some of our processing activities in the following ways:

* Adjusting Communication Preferences
    
    Emails From Goodwill OC: If you wish to no longer receive marketing email communications from us, you can click on the “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of the email or email us at Support@shopgoodwill.com to let us know, and we will remove you as soon as possible. Opting out of marketing or newsletter emails will not opt-you out of all emails—we may need to send you transactional or similar emails related to your Goodwill OC account, purchases, legal or contractual updates, or similar topics. You are not able to opt-out of these emails.
