BYOND Terms of Service

Last Updated: March 4, 2015  
  
**1\. ACCEPTANCE**  
  
Thank you for your interest in BYOND! We need your support to keep the system running, and truly appreciate your willingness to become an important part of BYOND. By using the BYOND software and/or website ("Service"), you agree to these terms.  
  
To make sure everyone on the system has the best experience, BYOND accounts are provided subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"). Violation of the TOS, as determined by the BYOND Staff, may result in a reduction of services provided to you, or a termination of your BYOND account.  
  
You should review our [Privacy Policy](http://www.byond.com/Privacy) as part of the acceptance of this agreement.  
  
**2\. CONDUCT**  
  
User content uploaded to or displayed on the website can be filtered or removed at the discretion of the BYOND staff. Items that warrant such action include, but are not limited to:  

* pornographic, racist, or otherwise vulgar content;  
    
* content that is intended to incite or attack a particular user or group;  
    
* content that causes a significant use of bandwidth for purposes that don't benefit the BYOND community in some manner acceptable to the BYOND Staff;  
    
* content that breaks any laws or contracts.

  
Content violations as well as inappropriate conduct in other areas of the BYOND system, such as creating excessive website or software "spam", harassing other users, or performing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on our network or our users, may warrant termination of the BYOND account. BYOND Staff reserves the sole right to determine what conduct is inappropriate.  
  
BYOND is not liable for any content provided by its users.  
  
**3\. MEMBERSHIP**  
  
Users who upgrade their account through the BYOND Membership program are held to the same standards above.  
  
Either you or the BYOND Staff has the right to terminate your BYOND Membership at any time.  
  
If your Membership is terminated by yourself or the BYOND Staff, there is no obligation for a refund of any amount you have paid for the Membership. In the event of termination, the BYOND Staff will determine whether you receive a partial, full, or no refund on your Membership.  
  
**4\. COPYRIGHT**  
  
BYOND stands for "Build Your Own Net Dream" and we believe that to best enjoy the experience you should "own" your "dream"; that is strive to create original games. However, we understand that almost every creative work out there is at least influenced by some other source; hence the issue of copyright infringment. While we do not actively investigate or monitor the games listed here, we must, by law, enforce copyrights as requested by their owner.  
  
If you are a game developer, you should avoid using third-party content without the permission of the original owner. This includes, but is not limited to, trademarks and the usage of images and other media not in the public domain. Violating these terms may result in a takedown of your listing, or the termination of your account for repeated offenses.  
  
If you are a copyright holder, and are concerned with the usage of your work on this site, [contact](http://www.byond.com/members/?command=contact) us and we will take care of the problem. You should provide contact information, a description of the copyrighted work, the location(s) on our site where the infringment is listed, and an affidavit attesting that you are the rightful owner, or can speak on behalf of them.  
  
**5\. MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICE, LIABILITY, AND WARRANTIES**  
  
We reserve the right to modify or discontinue any part of the Service at any time. You agree that BYOND will not be held liable for any modification or discontinuance of the Service.  
  
You also agree that BYOND will not be held liable for any damages of any kind resulting from your use of the Service.  
  
The Service is provided on an "as is" basis. BYOND expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.  
  
**6\. CONTACT**  
  
If you have any questions or issues with the material presented herein, feel free to [contact](http://www.byond.com/members/?command=contact) us!  
  
The BYOND Staff takes your participation seriously, and wishes to provide you as much leeway as reasonable to allow you to use your BYOND account as you will, within the bounds of being a good citizen in this exciting community.
