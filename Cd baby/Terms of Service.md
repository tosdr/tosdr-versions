All notices required or permitted to be given under these TOS will be in writing and delivered to the other party by any of the following methods: (i) U.S. mail, (ii) overnight courier, or (iii) electronic mail. If you give notice to CD Baby, you must use the following addresses: CD Baby, 9600 NE Cascades Parkway Suite 180, Portland, OR 97220 or [\[email protected\]](https://cdbaby.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

If applicable law requires that a given communication be “in writing,” you agree that email communication will satisfy this requirement.

**9\. Dispute Resolution.**
---------------------------

* **(a)** Mandatory Arbitration. Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND CD BABY AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.
* **(b)** Commencing Arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to CD Baby, to you via any other method available to CD Baby, including via e-mail. The Notice to CD Baby should be addressed to: \[CD Baby / ATTN: Legal / 9600 NE Cascades Parkway Suite 180 / Portland, OR / 97220\] (the “Arbitration Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the “Demand”). If you and CD Baby do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or CD Baby may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE “Rules”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against CD Baby, then CD Baby will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon CD Baby receipt of Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.
* **(c)** Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. A single independent and impartial arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and CD Baby agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
* **(d)** No Class Actions. YOU AND CD BABY AGREE THAT YOU AND CD BABY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.
* **(e)** Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator shall issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of California in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that this Agreement and your use of the Site evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in this Agreement.
* **(f)** Applicable Law. This Agreement and your use of the Site shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of California without reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles. Only if the Mandatory Arbitration clause is deemed to be null and void, then all disputes arising between you and CD Baby under this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon, and you and CD Baby hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.
* **(g)** Equitable Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution section do not apply to any claim in which CD Baby seeks equitable relief of any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by CD Baby or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against CD Baby, and your only remedy shall be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement.
* **(h)** Claims. You and CD Baby agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement, the use of the Site, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
* **(i)** Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against CD Baby must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution section, CD Baby may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that CD Baby has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.

**10\. Notice and procedure for making claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringements.**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **(a)** CD Baby respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our users to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Site or any CD Baby service.
* **(b)** CD Baby’s intellectual property policy is to (1) remove material that CD Baby believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Site, and (2) remove any Products or Submissions posted to the Site by “repeat infringers.” CD Baby considers a “repeat infringer” to be any user that has uploaded Products or Submissions to the Site and for whom CD Baby has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) with respect to such Products or Submissions. CD Baby has discretion, however, to terminate the account or permission to access the Site of any user after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon CD Baby’s own determination.
* **(c)** Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. If you believe that any Productions or Submissions made available on or through the Site or any CD Baby service have been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below. Your communication must include substantially the following:
    * **(i)** A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed;
    * **(ii)** Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
    * **(iii)** Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit CD Baby to locate the material;
    * **(iv)** Information reasonably sufficient to permit CD Baby to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;
    * **(v)** A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
    * **(vi)** A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.
* **(d)** Designated Agent Contact Information. CD Baby’s Designated Agent for notices of claimed infringement can be contacted at:
    * Via E-mail : [\[email protected\]](https://cdbaby.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
    * Via U.S. Mail : Copyright Notice – Legal Department, 9600 NE Cascades Parkway Suite 180, Portland, OR 97220
* **(e)** Counter Notification. If you receive a notification from CD Baby that material made available by you on or through the Site or any CD Baby service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide CD Baby with what is called a “Counter Notification.” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to CD Baby’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 10(d) of this TOS, and include substantially the following information:
    * **(i)** A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;
    * **(ii)** Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
    * **(iii)** A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
    * **(iv)** The subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which CD Baby may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 10(c) of this TOS above or an agent of such person.A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.
* **(f)** False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides that:
    * \[a\]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under \[Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)\] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of \[CD Baby\] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.
    * 17 U.S.C. § 512(f). CD Baby reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a notification of claimed infringement or counter notification in violation of the law.

For the avoidance of doubt, only notices submitted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the procedures set forth in this Section 10 should be sent to the Designated Agent at the e-mail or postal address set forth above. Any other comments, compliments, complaints or suggestions about CD Baby, the operation of the Site or any CD Baby service or any other matter should be sent to [\[email protected\]](https://cdbaby.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
