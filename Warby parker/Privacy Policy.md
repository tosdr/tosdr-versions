Privacy Policy
==============

### Effective Date: December 30, 2022

At Warby Parker, we’re all about helping you see things a little more clearly. And we believe that you have a right to know what information We collect from you. So we’ve created this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to let you know what to expect when you interact with Warby Parker Inc., which does business as Warby Parker (“Warby Parker,” “We,” “Us,” or “Our”), and any of Our affiliates, including Eye Doctors (defined below) and their practices, such as Walnut Vision Care, to which We may provide certain administrative or management services (“Affiliates”). This Policy applies to your use of Our retail locations; any of Our websites, website features, and mobile applications (each, an “App”).

We operate a mobile application and related website (the “Virtual Vision Test app”, formerly known as our Prescription Check app) and retail store service and related website (“In-Store Prescription Check” and, together with the Virtual Vision Test app, “Virtual Vision Test”) that you may use for the purpose of performing a vision test that may allow you to update your eyewear prescription. This Privacy Policy applies to your use of Virtual Vision Test. Collectively the retail locations, Our websites and Apps, Our Affiliates that display or contain a link to this Privacy Policy, and Virtual Vision Test are referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Services”.

Your use of Virtual Vision Test is subject to our [Virtual Vision Test Terms of Use](https://www.warbyparker.com/prescription-check-app/terms-of-use). Your use of all other Services is subject to our [Terms of Use](https://www.warbyparker.com/terms-of-use). Our use of any individually identifiable health information you provide is subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). In addition to this Privacy Policy, our [Notice of Privacy Practices](https://www.warbyparker.com/notice-of-privacy-practices) will apply to such information.

For additional details about the personal information we collect and the rights afforded to California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act, please scroll to Section 8.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected or received through other means, use and sharing of anonymous or deidentified data, or information collected by third party websites (“Third Party Services”), such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, and Google+, that We do not own or control, even if you access them through Our Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access so that you know how they will collect, use, and share your information.

Finally, some of the licensed optometrists and ophthalmologists (“Eye Doctors”) who perform medical services at Our locations are independent businessmen and women with their own practices (“Independent Practices”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to Independent Practices or to websites or mobile apps they operate. Please review the Independent Practices’ privacy notices for information on how they use customer information.

For additional details about the personal information We collect and the rights afforded to California residents, please see Your California Privacy Rights.

From time to time, We may clarify, revise, or update this Policy. This may include making changes to the way We collect, maintain, and store information. If We make any changes to this Policy, We will revise the date at the top of the Policy. Changes to this Policy will become effective once they are posted.

1\. What Information Warby Parker Collects
------------------------------------------

We collect different types of information for Our business purposes from the following sources:

**Information you provide us.** We collect information that you provide to Us through the Services and other communications. We may also collect information from entities you have requested or authorized to provide information to Us in connection with Our Services. For example:

* When you create an account with Us, you provide your first and last name, email address, and password.
* You may provide Us with information when you use certain online features, such as Home Try-On or when you book an eye exam. This information may include (i) your first and last name; email address; phone number; home, physical, or shipping address; and date of birth; (ii) information about the products you try on and purchase; (iii) information about other people, such as when you direct Us to send a gift card; or (iv) any other identifiers that may permit the physical or online contacting of a specific person. To the extent the information you provide is related to your health care status, including the provision of or payment for health care services, such information will be considered Protected Health Information and covered by Our Notice of Privacy Practices.
* When you make a purchase, We may request information from you to facilitate the transaction and get you the goods you requested. We may ask you to provide payment information, which may include payment card information (such as credit card number, type, and expiration date), vision insurance plan information, billing address, and shipping address. We do not store any payment card information.
* We may collect certain information from you when you apply for a job through Our [Jobs](https://www.warbyparker.com/jobs) page.
* For certain online, App, and in-store features, We may ask you to submit (or We may ask your permission to take) a photo, facial scan, or other image of you.
    * For example, when using the Virtual Try-On or Find Your Width features in our App, we use TrueDepth API technology with your camera to look at and measure multiple data points on your face. We use that information to place AR optical and sunglasses frames on your face in a realistic position and scale. We can also guide you to the best “width” frames based on your facial data points. We do not store any of these scans or measurements and we only collect and use that data while you are using the Virtual Try-On feature. We do not share these scans or measurements with any third parties.
    * When using the Digital PD tool, we use your camera and face mesh and depth map data from the TrueDepth API technology to measure your facial features, including your pupillary distance (PD). Your PD is a needed measurement for your glasses prescription. Once we have a measurement, you can choose if you would like to update and store this measurement with your Warby Parker glasses prescription details. If you choose to add this data to your prescription, the PD measurement is added to your Warby Parker glasses prescription details and may be shared with third parties as a part of your prescription in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you choose not to add this data to your existing Warby Parker prescription, we do not store or share this data with any third parties.
* When you use Virtual Vision Test, you disclose certain information about yourself by (1) answering a series of questions to determine whether you are eligible to participate in Virtual Vision Test (the "Eligibility Questionnaire"), (2) performing a series of tasks to help licensed optometrists or ophthalmologists (each an "Eye Doctor") determine whether to issue you a renewed prescription (the "Vision Test"), (3) recording your audio responses to the Vision Test tasks, and (4) communicating with Warby Parker or our Eye Doctors in connection with your use of Virtual Vision Test. The In-Store Prescription Check Vision Test includes an acuity test and measurement of your refractive error using a handheld device, and the results of both will be provided to Us.
    * _"Health Information"_ is information that relates to your past and present health or vision conditions (including medications, ailments, and prescriptions) that is derived from your use of Virtual Vision Test or MyVisionDirectory. Some Health Information may be subject to laws and regulations, including HIPAA. You represent that any Health Information that you disclose to us is your Health Information that you are authorized to disclose to us. "Personal Information" is information about you, including your first name, last name, and demographic information, derived from your use of Virtual Vision Test or MyVisionDirectory. Your Warby Parker account may contain Personal Information and Health Information, and we will access such information when you use Virtual Vision Test. Additionally, in order to facilitate your use of Virtual Vision Test and to help an Eye Doctor determine your need for an eyewear prescription, we may collect the following information when you use Virtual Vision Test:
        * your name, age, email address, username, or other Personal Information or Health Information contained in your Warby Parker account
        * answers and written information that you submit during the Eligibility Questionnaire
        * your answers to, performance of, and actions taken during the Vision Test timestamps of all actions that you take within the Virtual Vision Test App
        * Health Information prepared by an Eye Doctor who provides you Services, such as medical records, prescriptions, treatment decisions, medical advice, examination notes, and any other information prepared by an Eye Doctor about your health or vision
        * billing information that you provide Us, such as credit card information
        * any other information that you submit to Us in connection with your Eligibility Questionnaire, Vision Test, Virtual Vision Test, or the Services, including information exchanged in emails, texts, chats, or calls between you and Warby Parker.
* When you contact Us, We do everything possible to make sure you have an exceptional shopping experience. If you contact Us in person, by phone (calling or texting), email, instant message (including Facebook Messenger), live chat, through social media or Our App, or by some other means, We may keep a record of your contact information and the content of the communication for later reference. When We send you emails, We may track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve Our Services. We receive responses to any survey that you choose to complete for Us.

**Information We collect from third parties.** Third parties, including your Eye Doctor, may share your information with Us in order for Us to provide Services or complete your purchase. For example:

* Some parts of Our Services can be linked to other accounts you have with Third Party Services, such as your social media or Google account (“Third Party Accounts”), or you may be able to register for an account on Our Services with your Third Party Account. If you connect a Third Party Account to Our Services or interact with Us through a Third Party Account, We may receive information about you, including your Third Party Account profile information and your photo, and your use of the Third Party Account (for example, if you select a Warby Parker product to purchase through the account). If you mention Us through your Third Party Account, We may collect publicly available information and content related to your comment.
* We may collect information about you from other third parties, including demographic information. We may combine information collected from other third parties with other information We collect about you.

**Information We automatically collect.** We record certain information and store it in log files when you interact with Our Services. This information may include device information, browser history, internet protocol (IP) address, URLs of referring/exit pages, and search terms. For example:

* We may collect information from your mobile device(s).

* _In-store Wi-Fi._ When you connect to Our in-store Wi-Fi from your mobile device, We receive information about you and your device, including your device’s MAC address, IP address, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and technical details about your device such as its operating system, device type (including make and model), and technical capabilities. We will also receive information about how you use Our Wi-Fi network while you are connected, including the store location, the areas of the store you visit, the names and/or Internet addresses of the websites you visit and the applications you use, and how long you interact with such sites or applications. If your mobile device is configured to search for available Wi-Fi networks, We may receive information about your device even if you choose not to connect to Our Wi-Fi services.
* _Our Warby Parker App._ When you download and use Our Warby Parker App, We receive information from your mobile device, such as IP address, device information, and unique device identifiers. We may also receive information about your precise location from your device, but only if you enable location tracking on your device.
* _Virtual Vision Test App._ When you use the Virtual Vision Test App, We may collect information about your mobile device, such as IP address, device information, and unique device identifiers, and We may derive your approximate location from your IP address. When you permit the Virtual Vision Test App to access your location through your mobile device settings, We may collect the precise location of your device when the Virtual Vision Test App is running in the foreground or background. Your location information is necessary to confirm your location while using the Virtual Vision Test App, so We can be sure that your results are reviewed by an Eye Doctor licensed in your state.

* Like most websites, Our Services may incorporate technology such as “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, and “cookies” that allow Us and Our service providers to collect information about your actions on Our Services. Our service providers may collect information about your online activities over time and across different online services. Cookies (not to be confused with the sugary morsels) are small files that web servers may place on your computer when you visit a website.
* We may also collect information when you are visiting Our stores. Like most retailers, We have in-store video surveillance for security, fraud, and loss prevention purposes. In addition, We analyze videos to help Us understand customer behavior and retail traffic within Our physical spaces.

2\. How We Use Your Information
-------------------------------

We may use information We collect to operate Our business, including:

* For Our everyday business purposes, such as providing Services and products, providing information you request and providing customer support
* To communicate with Affiliates
* To offer administrative, management, and other business services to Our commercial customers, such as Affiliates and some Independent Practices, including to confirm, reschedule, or provide other services related to your eye exam

3\. How Long We Keep Your Information
-------------------------------------

We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as we reasonably consider it necessary for achieving the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, or for as long as we are legally required to retain it.

4\. How We Share Your Information
---------------------------------

If We share your information, We do so to support Our business, including with:

**Affiliates and Service Providers.** We’ve figured out ways to do a lot of things on Our own, but We haven’t quite figured out how to do all of it. We may share information with Our corporate entities and affiliates, service providers, data processors, third party contractors, payment processors, others who perform services for Us, such as:

* order fulfillment
* delivery services
* payment processing
* vision insurance claim processing
* account registration
* website-related services, such as web hosting
* improvement of website-related services and features
* maintenance services
* marketing services
* data analytics

**Other Entities.** We may share information as part of a merger, acquisition, or other sale or transfer of all or part of Our assets or business or with other entities as you have authorized or requested.

**With Marketing, Analytics, and Advertising Partners.** Some of Our third-party advertising partners use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your online activities on Our Services and across other online services in order to deliver more relevant advertising when you are using the Services or other websites. Our service providers may also collect information about your mobile device from other tracking technologies while you are near or in Our stores to help Us better understand Our customers and how they use Our Services. These services may include Google Analytics and Adjust Technology.

**With Your Eye Doctor and Dispensing Optician.** We may share your information with your Eye Doctor so that they may provide you services, to confirm the prescription information you provide us, or if you’ve asked Us to obtain your prescription information from your Eye Doctor. At your request, We may also share your information with a dispensing optician.

**With Your Vision Insurance Carrier.** We may share your information with your vision insurance carrier so they can process your claim and so that We receive payment.

**Social Media.** We may include widgets, toolbars, or icons from social media providers on Our Services that allow you to interact or share information with them, and these social media networks may collect information about your browsing on the pages of Our Services. Such collection may occur where the widgets, toolbars, or icons are visible, even when you do not click on or otherwise activate the widgets, toolbars, or icons. The privacy policy of the relevant social media network controls the collection, use, and disclosure of all information collected by that social media network.

**To Protect Us and Others.** We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that We reasonably believe is necessary to comply with any applicable law, court order, subpoena, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; cooperate with law enforcement; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, Our [Terms of Use](https://www.warbyparker.com/terms-of-use), and other agreements; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Warby Parker, Our employees, Our users, or others.

The third parties that receive your information are required to treat your Personal Information in accordance with appropriate contractual and legal privacy and security requirements and laws to ensure they provide adequate protection over your information. For example, where applicable, Warby Parker has contractual agreements in place, such as with its service providers, to ensure that they provide the same or equal protection of your information as stated here.

Opting out or unsubscribing will not prevent you from receiving emails about orders or other transactions you make through Our Services or emails in response to a specific request from you, such as password recovery. If you decide you don’t want to receive text messages from us, you can opt out in your account settings.

If you would like to opt out of the use of your mobile app activity for targeted advertising purposes, you may do so by visiting your device’s privacy settings (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS devices).

If you wish to stop receiving push notifications from Us on your mobile device, you can update your device settings.

If you wish to limit the information available to Us through your Third Party Accounts, such as Google or social media, you should visit the privacy settings of your Third Party Accounts to learn about your options.
