INTEL.COM WEBSITE TERMS OF USE
------------------------------

Last Modified: June 21, 2024

**1\. Acceptance of Terms of Use**

This Website and the materials made available by and through this website are provided by Intel Corporation and its affiliates (“Intel”) for use by its customers, consumers, employees, and ecosystem partners and is intended for personal and informational use only. By accessing, browsing, or using this website or the downloadable materials made generally available through the Website, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and any additional terms and conditions which may accompany certain materials made available through this Website (collectively, the “Terms”). These Terms strictly pertain to your interaction with the Website and Materials (as defined below). If you are an individual acting on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of that entity and to bind that entity to the Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS WEBSITE OR ANY MATERIALS FROM IT.

**2\. Scope of Terms. Modifications. Translations.**

**2.1 Application**: The Terms apply to all websites where these Terms are posted, displayed, or referenced ("Website/Websites"), whether the sites are sponsored, managed, or hosted by Intel or third parties but do not extend to any agreements entered into using electronic signature tools on the Websites. The terms of any Agreements executed through the use of electronic signature tools on the Websites shall prevail over these Terms in the event of any conflict. Any modifications to these Terms will not retroactively alter any contractual agreements unless explicitly agreed upon in writing to the contrary. The Terms otherwise apply to any resources and tools provided through the Websites, including but not limited to developer tools, software, download areas, research areas, community forums, chat rooms, blogs, sharing sites, and product information. Finally, the Terms apply to documents made available on the Websites such as white papers, press releases, datasheets, and specification documents but do not extend to any separate agreements you may enter through the Website’s electronic signature tool. Hereafter, the foregoing documents will be referred to as the "Materials."

**2.2 Supplementary Terms for Materials and Sub-Sites**: Certain Materials or sub-sites accessible via the Websites may have their own supplementary terms and conditions specific to them. By accessing or using those Materials or sub-sites, you accept and agree to be bound by the applicable supplementary terms and conditions. These Terms will apply and remain in effect with respect to those Materials and sub-sites, provided that, to the extent these Terms conflict with or are superseded by any such supplementary terms and conditions, the supplementary terms and conditions will govern and control.

**2.3 Changes and Updates to Terms**: Intel may, but is not required to, substitute, add to, change, or remove any part of the Terms at any time without notice to you (“Modified Terms”). Modified Terms will be effective when posted by Intel, and your use of the Websites or the Materials after the posting of the Modified Terms will be deemed your acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the Modified Terms. The date on which the Modified Terms are posted will be stated at the beginning of the Modified Terms. If you do not agree to the Modified Terms, you must stop using the Websites and Materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Modified Terms will not impact the terms of any Agreement executed through an electronic signature tool on the Websites without prior written consent of the parties thereto.

**2.4 Translations of Terms**: Where Intel has provided you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English-language versions of these Terms will govern your relationship with Intel. If there is any contradiction between the English-language version of these Terms and the translation, the English-language version will govern and control.

**2.5 Modification of Websites and Materials**: Intel may, but is not required to, substitute, add to, change, remove, disable, or suspend the Websites, the Materials, or any portion thereof, temporarily or permanently, at any time without notice to you. These changes may include without limitation alterations to the features, functions, specifications, and pricing of any products or services described in or displayed on the Websites or the Materials.

**3\. Security and Privacy**

**3.1 Personal Information**: Personal information you submit to Intel through forms on the Websites or the Materials is governed by Intel's [Privacy Notice](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/privacy/intel-privacy-notice.html), which describes how Intel collects, processes, and discloses your personal information. By accessing and using the Websites, you acknowledge that you have read and understand Intel’s Privacy Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, information submitted through the use of an electronic signature tool will not opt you into the receipt of marketing communications.

**3.2 Member Account, Password, and Security**: Accessing certain Materials and/or sub-sites may require that you establish a member account and select a password. It is a condition of your use of those Materials and sub-sites that all the information you provide as part of registering for an account is accurate, current, and complete. Your account is personal to you. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. You may not permit any third party to use your account, nor may you use anyone else's account at any time. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify Intel immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security in connection with your account or your password.

**3.3 Misuse of Account**: Intel will not be liable to you or to any third party for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, Intel reserves the right to hold you liable for losses incurred by Intel or by a third party due to someone else using your account or password.

**3.4 Disabling or Suspension of Account**: Intel has the right to disable or suspend any account at any time in Intel’s sole and absolute discretion, no matter the reason, without notice to you.

**5\. Retained Rights. Patents.**

**6.1 Trademarks**: Any trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, trade dress, and other brand features (“Trademarks”) displayed on or featured in the Websites or the Materials are the property of either Intel or third-party licensors. Nothing in these Terms grants you any license rights or other rights to use or display any such Trademarks.

**7.2 Definition of User Content**: “User Content” means any content or materials that a user provides, transmits, or submits to Intel using the Websites or posts, uploads, or displays on the Websites. “User Content” includes but is not limited to user registration, participation, public sharing, posting, uploading, linking, downloading, transferring, viewing, blogging, commenting, chat room, bulletin board and forum participation, or submitting or transmitting user content, including but not limited to graphics, art, software, code, data, text, video, audio, opinions, descriptions, photographs, pictures, etc. For the avoidance of doubt, the user content submitted on Intel’s Websites for general and informational use will not be conflated with the content or information processed through the click-to-accept tool.

Intel will remove User Content if properly notified that it infringes on another's copyright rights in accordance with the section of these terms titled “DMCA Copyright Infringement Claim.” Intel further reserves the right to remove User Content no matter the reason, in its sole discretion, and without prior notice to you or to any third party.

**7.4 Ownership of User Content**: Intel does not claim ownership of any User Content. However, unless otherwise agreed to in writing, Intel will be free to use User Content without compensation or payment to you. Intel is under no obligation to post or use any User Content submitted. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with an authorized Intel representative, User Content you transmit or post to the Websites will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary.

**7.5 License to User Content**: Unless otherwise specified on the Websites, by posting, displaying, uploading, inputting, providing, or submitting User Content, you grant Intel, its sublicensees, and any users of the Websites or the Materials, a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, unlimited, irrevocable, nonterminable, freely transferrable, and freely sublicensable (through multiple tiers of sublicensees) license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and publicly display the User Content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such User Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed for any and all commercial or non-commercial purposes throughout the world.

**7.6 User Submitted Code**: To the extent applicable, any user submitted code posted on the Websites is supplied under the license specified by the user submitting such code, and should be used or downloaded only in accordance with any such license terms.

**7.7 Representations and Warranties**: By posting or submitting User Content you represent and warrant to Intel that (a) you own or otherwise control all of the rights to that User Content, including but not limited to all of the rights necessary for you to provide, post, upload, input, or submit the User Content, and to grant the rights granted by you to Intel in connection with the User Content, and (b) the User Content does not infringe, violate, or misappropriate the intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights of any third party, including without limitation any third-party publicity rights or privacy rights.

Without limiting the foregoing, Intel will have the right to remove any User Content at any time and for any reason in Intel’s sole discretion.

ACCORDINGLY, PLEASE DO NOT SEND YOUR UNSOLICITED IDEAS TO INTEL OR ANYONE AT INTEL. IF, DESPITE OUR REQUEST THAT YOU NOT SEND US YOUR IDEAS AND MATERIALS, YOU STILL SEND THEM, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT INTEL MAKES NO ASSURANCES THAT YOUR IDEAS AND MATERIALS WILL BE TREATED AS CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY.

The product information on the Websites or the Materials is subject to change without notice to you. Do not finalize a design using this information.

**10.6 Benchmarks and Performance Claims**: Any performance tests and ratings provided in the Websites and the Materials are measured using specific computer systems and/or components and reflect the approximate performance of Intel products as measured by those tests. For further information about benchmarks and measurements and the performance of Intel products, please visit our [Performance Index page](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/performance/benchmarks/overview/).

**10.7 Availability**: Just because a product is displayed on the Websites or in the Materials does not mean that the product is available for purchase in all countries, jurisdictions, or localities. Contact your local Intel sales office or your distributor to learn the availability of products in your geographic area.

**11\. DMCA Copyright Infringement Claim**

**11.1 Notice of Claimed Infringement**: Pursuant to Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2), notifications of claimed copyright infringement should be sent to Intel’s Designated Agent.

ACCORDINGLY, YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITES AND THE MATERIALS IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

13.3 INTEL DOES NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR SUFFICIENCY OF ANY MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEBSITES AND AS SUCH YOUR USE OF ANY MATERIALS OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE WEBSITES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS OR OTHER DEVICES OR FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF THE MATERIALS.

**13.4 Limitation of Liability: YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT INTEL, ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR:**

**13.5 ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, RESULTING FROM ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS, OR SIMILAR LOSS, IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITES OR THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTS, SERVICES, OR INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITES, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY UNDER WHICH SUCH DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT (WHETHER IN AN ACTION FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHER ACTION IN TORT).**

**13.6 ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF (a) ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU ON THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY, OR EXISTENCE OF ANY CONTENT IN OR ON THE WEBSITES, THE MATERIALS, OR THE DOCUMENTS, ANY CHANGES MADE BY INTEL THERETO, OR ANY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY CESSATION BY INTEL IN THE PROVISION THEREOF, OR (b) YOUR FAILURE TO KEEP YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT DETAILS SECURE AND CONFIDENTIAL.**
