**7.2 Definition of User Content**: “User Content” means any content or materials that a user provides, transmits, or submits to Intel using the Websites or posts, uploads, or displays on the Websites. “User Content” includes but is not limited to user registration, participation, public sharing, posting, uploading, linking, downloading, transferring, viewing, blogging, commenting, chat room, bulletin board and forum participation, or submitting or transmitting user content, including but not limited to graphics, art, software, code, data, text, video, audio, opinions, descriptions, photographs, pictures, etc.

**7.4 Ownership of User Content**: Intel does not claim ownership of any User Content. However, unless otherwise agreed to in writing, Intel will be free to use User Content without compensation or payment to you. Intel is under no obligation to post or use any User Content submitted. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with an authorized Intel representative, User Content you transmit or post to the Websites will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary.

**7.6 User Submitted Code**: To the extent applicable, any user submitted code posted on the Websites is supplied under the license specified by the user submitting such code, and should be used or downloaded only in accordance with any such license terms.

Without limiting the foregoing, Intel will have the right to remove any User Content at any time and for any reason in Intel’s sole discretion.

Designers must not rely on the absence or characteristics of any features or instructions marked "reserved" or "undefined."

The product information on the Websites or the Materials is subject to change without notice to you. Do not finalize a design using this information.

**10.4 Processor Numbers**: Intel processor numbers are not a measure of performance. Processor numbers differentiate features within each processor family, not across different processor families.

**10.6 Benchmarks and Performance Claims**: Any performance tests and ratings provided in the Websites and the Materials are measured using specific computer systems and/or components and reflect the approximate performance of Intel products as measured by those tests. For further information about benchmarks and measurements and the performance of Intel products, please visit our [Performance Index page](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/performance/benchmarks/overview/).

**10.7 Availability**: Just because a product is displayed on the Websites or in the Materials does not mean that the product is available for purchase in all countries, jurisdictions, or localities. Contact your local Intel sales office or your distributor to learn the availability of products in your geographic area.

**11\. DMCA Copyright Infringement Claim**

**11.1 Notice of Claimed Infringement**: Pursuant to Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2), notifications of claimed copyright infringement should be sent to Intel’s Designated Agent. INQUIRIES NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE PROCEDURE OUTLINED MAY NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. See [Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/legal/dmca-notice-and-procedure.html) for instructions on submitting an inquiry.

**11.2 Repeat Infringement**: Intel may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate or suspend an account or subscription to the Websites for repeat infringement. If you believe that an account holder or subscriber is a repeat infringer, please follow the instructions above to contact Intel's DMCA agent and provide information sufficient for Intel to verify that the account holder or subscriber is a repeat infringer.

**12\. Links to Other Materials or Sites**

The Websites and/or the Materials may contain links to other Internet sites. The linked sites are not under the control of Intel and Intel is not responsible for the content of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site. Intel reserves the right to terminate any link or linking program at any time. Intel does not endorse companies or products to which it links and reserves the right to note as such on the Websites or the Materials.

INTEL AND EACH OF ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, VALIDITY, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. ACCORDINGLY, YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITES AND THE MATERIALS IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

13.3 INTEL DOES NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR SUFFICIENCY OF ANY MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEBSITES AND AS SUCH YOUR USE OF ANY MATERIALS OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE WEBSITES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS OR OTHER DEVICES OR FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF THE MATERIALS.

**13.4 Limitation of Liability: YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT INTEL, ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR:**

**13.5 ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, RESULTING FROM ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS, OR SIMILAR LOSS, IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITES OR THE MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTS, SERVICES, OR INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITES, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY UNDER WHICH SUCH DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT (WHETHER IN AN ACTION FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHER ACTION IN TORT).**

**13.6 ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF (a) ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU ON THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY, OR EXISTENCE OF ANY CONTENT IN OR ON THE WEBSITES, THE MATERIALS, OR THE DOCUMENTS, ANY CHANGES MADE BY INTEL THERETO, OR ANY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY CESSATION BY INTEL IN THE PROVISION THEREOF, OR (b) YOUR FAILURE TO KEEP YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT DETAILS SECURE AND CONFIDENTIAL.**

13.7 THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ON INTEL'S LIABILITY WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT INTEL KNEW OF, WAS ADVISED OF, OR OTHERWISE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITES OR THE MATERIALS MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES. THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THE TERMS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

**13.8 Indemnification**: You agree to indemnify, at Intel’s election defend, and hold Intel and each of its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, suppliers, and licensors (the “Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against all actions, claims, or demands, and all losses, damages, liabilities, fees, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and legal costs) arising from or relating to your breach or violation of the Terms or any content you make available through the Websites or Materials. You acknowledge and agree that Intel may, at any time, assume the exclusive defense and control over any claim for which you owe indemnity to Intel hereunder, and you agree to fully cooperate with Intel, at Intel’s reasonable request, in connection with Intel’s defense and investigation of any such claim.
