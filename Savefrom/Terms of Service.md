Discontinuation of Service in the United Kingdom

Dear Savefrom User:

As you may have heard, our industry has been under strenuous attacks by certain UK copyright holders. Because of these attacks, it has become financially impractical for Savefrom to continue to provide services in the United Kingdom.

Accordingly, Savefrom will be terminating its services in the United Kingdom.

We thank you for your past loyalty and patronage and wish you health and safety during the present health crisis and beyond.

Very truly yours,

Savefrom
