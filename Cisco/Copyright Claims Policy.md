### 3\. White Papers, Implementation Guides, and Technology Overviews

* Cisco routinely authors white papers, implementation guides, and technology overviews. Cisco does not generally license these materials for reproduction or distribution for commercial purposes (e.g., in for-profit books or compilations) or permit local hosting of these materials on third-party webpages. Instead, Cisco encourages and specifically authorizes parties to â€œdeep link" to webpages on www.cisco.com, without additional permission from Cisco. This policy ensures that all links are to the most current versions of the works. See our [Web Usage Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/brand-center/copyright-use.html) for more information.
    
    _Special exception for use in bona fide educational programs:_ Instructor duplication and distribution to students in bona fide educational programs of Cisco white papers, implementation guides, and technology overviews is expressly authorized, without additional permission from Cisco, subject to the following limitations:
    
    * Except for actual duplication costs, students must not be charged for such materials.
    * Cisco materials must not be bound into any compilation or collective work. All Cisco materials must be collated by a separate binding (if any).
    * Instructors may reproduce only sufficient copies to meet the anticipated needs for the current course or term.
    * Reproductions of Cisco materials must retain all original copyright notices.
    * Course materials offered by Cisco or its authorized learning partners are not covered by this exception, and may be duplicated and distributed only with the prior consent of Cisco and/or the applicable learning partner.  
          
        
    
    Requests for permissions that are not covered by the above can be submitted via Cisco's Request Tool. Before submitting any request, please have ready the name of a Cisco employee who sponsors your proposed use (e.g., a Cisco person who is responsible for authoring and/or managing the specific copyrighted materials). Requests without an internal Cisco employee sponsor cannot be processed. If you do not know the name of the Cisco employee responsible for managing the specific copyrighted materials, check the document number (listed on the last page of the document).
    
    * When the document number starts with a "C", immediately followed by three sets of numbers (e.g. C02-123456-02), send the document number to [cmp-docsearch@cisco.com](mailto:cmp-docsearch@cisco.com) and ask for the relevant document owner's contact information.
    * For all other documents, mail [web-help@cisco.com](mailto:web-help@cisco.com), identify the document title, URL, and technology area of the document, and ask for a contact within the relevant technology area.

### 5\. Product Documentation

* End-user purchasers of Cisco products may, without the need for a written license from Cisco, reproduce and modify any Cisco product documentation accompanying such products, for distribution within their organization in order to use the products.
    
    Cisco authorized resellers, systems integrators, government contractors, and other similarly situated third-party installers may, without the need for a written license from Cisco, reproduce Cisco product documentation (including media type changes) and create derivative works thereof in the form of compilations, for distribution to their end-user customers.

    * The screen capture must not contain the name or logo of any third party, or any other content identified as owned, managed or copyrighted by any third party. View a list of Cisco Trademarks.

    * You agree to stop using and displaying the screen capture at any time, upon written request of Cisco; provided, however, that (a) if any Cisco.com screen captures appear in printed materials at the time of such request, and (b) you have otherwise complied with these requirements, and (c) you coordinate to remove the Cisco.com screen captures from future versions of such printed materials, then you may continue to use and distribute such screen captures as incorporated into your then-existing printed materials.
