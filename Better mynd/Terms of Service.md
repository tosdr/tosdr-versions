Scope. The BetterMynd Terms of Service consist of the Terms of Service and the Privacy

Policy. The Terms of Service constitutes an agreement between you and BetterMynd, Inc. that

allows you to make use of the BetterMynd website located at www.bettermynd.com (the “Site”)

Applicability. The Platform is intended to make mental health care more accessible for college

care providers (“Counselors”). Most of the provisions of these Terms of Service are generally

applicable to all users of the Site and/or the Platform, including without limitation Students and

and (ii) Counselors using the Platform to arrange for the provision of mental health care services

differently, in addition to these Terms of Service, there are separate Special Terms and

the Special Terms and Conditions are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service, and

Personal information or protected health information is information that includes, but is not
