General use
-----------

As a rule, it is possible to use our website without providing personal data. Apart from the connection to our website, meta data and other technical data (e.g. browser type, IP address, etc.) are not stored, as we have disabled permanent storage of access logs.

To use luckycloud or luckycloud Storage in the logged-in area, the user must create an account with luckycloud. To do this, the user must enter an existing email address or create a new email address via luckycloud Email and select a secure password. The user will be sent a confirmation link to the specified email address for possible password recovery in case the user forgets the login password.

In order to use luckycloud Mail, the user must have registered with luckycloud beforehand. The user receives their own e-mail address during setup. With this e-mail address, it is possible to create an anonymous user account and to communicate within and outside of luckycloud by e-mail. The e-mail address for recovery is automatically the address with which the user created the luckycloud account. Alternatively, the user can store another e-mail address for recovery in order to reset the password independently. Further personal data is only collected if the user provides this information voluntarily, for example in the context of an inquiry or registration.

In order to use luckycloud Team, the user must have previously registered with luckycloud and activated luckycloud Team activated.
