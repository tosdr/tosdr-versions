DISPUTE RESOLUTION
------------------

YOU AND LITTLETON COIN COMPANY, INC. AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US THAT CANNOT BE RESOLVED INFORMALLY CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN EITHER ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT. AND YOU AND LITTLETON COIN COMPANY, INC. AGREE TO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO PURSUE RELIEF AS PART OF A CLASS.

1.1 Scope and Opt-Out Rights

This section (the “Arbitration Agreement”), including all subsections, shall be construed broadly to cover all complaints, demands, and claims of any kind arising between you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. (each a “Dispute,” and, collectively, “Disputes”). The term “Disputes” shall be interpreted in the broadest possible sense and includes, but is not limited to, all statutory, regulatory, constitutional, contractual, common law, and tax-related claims, including claims alleging negligence, fraud, and misrepresentation, irrespective the relief being sought.

The Arbitration Agreement applies to all agents, attorneys, contractors, subcontractors, service providers, employees, and all others acting for, on behalf of, or under the direction or control of you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc., including all affiliated companies (including, but not limited to, parents, subsidiaries, and sibling corporations) of Littleton Coin Company, Inc. This Arbitration Agreement is binding on you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc., as well as our respective heirs, successors, and assigns.

This Arbitration Agreement, including as to all matters concerning its terms, substantive and procedural requirements, applicability, legality, enforceability, performance, and scope is governed solely and exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not by any state, local, or foreign laws. You and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. agree that this Arbitration Agreement involves interstate commerce for purposes of the FAA.

You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a written notice to Littleton Coin Company, Inc. expressly stating “I opt out of the Arbitration Agreement” or words to that effect to [\[email protected\]](https://www.littletoncoin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to Yvonne Burlock, Director of Fulfillment, 1309 MT Eustis Road Littleton, NH 03561 within thirty (30) days after you first agree to these Terms. Your communication must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have or may enter in the future with Littleton Coin Company, Inc., nor does it eliminate or change any other rights or requirements of the Terms.

1.2 Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process

Before either you or Littleton Coin Company, Inc. can pursue a Dispute in arbitration or small claims court, this mandatory, informal sixty (60) day dispute resolution process (“DRP”) must be completed.

To initiate the DRP, the party pursuing a Dispute (“Claimant”) must send to the other party (“Respondent”) a signed, written statement (“Statement”) explaining the Dispute in sufficient detail for the Respondent to understand and investigate it. In order to commence the DRP, the Statement must include the Claimant’s full name, mailing address, email address, and date or dates on which the Dispute arose, as well as a proposal for resolving it (which, if applicable, must describe the basis for any dollar amount claimed). If you are a purchaser or licensor of any products or services from Littleton Coin Company, Inc., you must describe your purchase/licensing history and, if not otherwise provided, include the email address used in connection with such activity. You agree to send the Statement by certified mail, return receipt requested to Yvonne Burlock, Director of Fulfillment, 1309 MT Eustis Road Littleton, NH 03561 or by email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.littletoncoin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If the Claimant is represented by an attorney, the Statement must authorize Littleton Coin Company, Inc. to disclose information relating to the Dispute to a named attorney. That attorney shall also sign the Statement under oath, or under penalty of perjury in a manner consistent with 28 U.S.C. § 1746 or analogous state laws, certifying compliance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule 11”), which statement shall be admissible in any arbitration that may follow. The arbitrator in any such arbitration shall have the authority to impose sanctions as provided for by Rule 11.

Once a Statement fully satisfying the above requirements is received, Claimant and Respondent shall work in good faith to resolve the Dispute for a period of sixty (60) days. If the Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days, the Claimant may thereafter pursue the Dispute either in an individual arbitration or, if the Dispute qualifies, in small claims court. To the extent necessary to preserve any Dispute presented in the Statement, all applicable statutes of limitation shall be suspended for the duration of the sixty (60) day period.

A party initiating an arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the DRP and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to their demand for arbitration. This certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their lawyer, if represented).

1.3 Arbitration Generally

All arbitrations shall be conducted before a single arbitrator. While there is no judge or jury in an arbitration, the arbitrator has the power to award the same relief as a court and must construe and apply the Terms in the same way a court would. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall have sole authority to and shall address all claims or arguments by both you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. concerning the formation, legality, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and the Terms, the scope of this Arbitration Agreement, and the arbitrability of any claims between you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc.. The results of any arbitration between you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. shall be binding only as to the specific Dispute resolved in that arbitration, and factual findings and legal conclusions shall not be binding on you or Littleton Coin Company, Inc. in any other arbitration or in any court proceeding. You and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with the arbitrator to address the reduction or deferral of fees or costs.

Upon either party’s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.

Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Rule 11).

In any arbitration between you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc., the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award issued is less than the defending party’s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party’s favor, the other party must pay the defending party’s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorneys’ fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled.

Any court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enforce all aspects of this Arbitration Agreement (including the requirement to complete the DRP before filing any claim in arbitration or small claims court) and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration and the assessment of fees or costs by any arbitrator or arbitration organization.

The rules applicable to an arbitration commenced between you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. shall depend on whether the arbitration is an Individual Arbitration or a Mass Arbitration as defined below.

1.4 Individual Arbitration Rules

All individual arbitrations shall be before a single neutral arbitrator. Arbitrations brought by consumers shall be governed by this Arbitration Agreement and the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “Consumer Rules”). You can find additional information about the arbitration process at this [link](https://www.adr.org/). The Consumer Rules shall apply if the dispute involves or is related to goods or services offered or purchased for personal or household use only, and not goods or services offered or purchased to support the conduct of any business or profession or for any other purpose other than personal or household use.

All other arbitrations shall be governed by this Arbitration Agreement and the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and the AAA Optional Appellate Rules. To the extent there is a conflict between this Arbitration Agreement and any applicable AAA rules and protocols, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement shall control to the fullest extent which still preserves the mutual obligation to arbitrate all Disputes.

Consistent with and pursuant to Rule D-1 (a) of the Consumer Rules, you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. agree that all consumer arbitrations under this Arbitration Agreement shall be resolved through binding, non-appearance-based arbitration rendered solely on documents submitted by the parties, including sworn statements (collectively, “Documents”), and without a hearing. Upon request of the other party, you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. will reaffirm their commitment to proceed in this fashion in writing as provided for in Rule D-1 (a). The parties shall be given an opportunity to respond with additional Documents after initial Documents are submitted. If the parties agree to a hearing in a particular arbitration or one is ordered by the arbitrator for good cause shown, it shall be limited to argument only and conducted telephonically or by video conference, and not in-person. If a hearing is held, the parties will afterwards have the opportunity to submit additional Documents.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the AAA and to Yvonne Burlock, Director of Fulfillment, 1309 MT Eustis Road Littleton, NH 03561 or [\[email protected\]](https://www.littletoncoin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). The AAA’s address is American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 (the “AAA Notice Address”). You may also send a copy to the AAA online at [https://www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) .

If the AAA is for any reason whatsoever unavailable, unable, or unwilling to handle an arbitration assigned to it under this subsection of the Arbitration Agreement, you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. shall negotiate in good faith for the substitution of an alternative arbitrator or arbitration organization to conduct the arbitration in conformity with the requirements of this Arbitration Agreement. If you or Littleton Coin Company, Inc. are unable to agree on such an alternative, you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. shall jointly petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator or arbitration organization pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5 to conduct the arbitration consistent with the requirements of this Arbitration Agreement.

1.5 Mass Arbitration Rules

If twenty-five (25) or more consumers file or indicate collectively or through counsel an intention to file demands for arbitration against Littleton Coin Company, Inc. raising similar Disputes, and counsel for the Claimants are the same or coordinated across such demands (a “Mass Arbitration”), the Mass Arbitration rules set out in this paragraph apply. To the extent there is a conflict between these Mass Arbitration Rules and any other provision of the Arbitration Agreement, these Mass Arbitration Rules shall control.

Each individual Claimant in a Mass Arbitration (each a “Mass Arbitration Claimant”) must complete individually the DRP process set forth in Subsection 1.2 as a condition precedent to proceeding to arbitration. Each Statement must affirm that counsel for the Mass Arbitration Claimants has been retained as legal counsel to act on the Claimant’s behalf. The attorney or attorneys representing each such Claimant shall sign under oath, or under penalty of perjury in a manner consistent with 28 U.S.C. § 1746 or analogous state laws, a certification of compliance with Rule 11 applicable to each and every Mass Arbitration Claimant, which statement shall be admissible in all arbitrations that may follow. The arbitrator in such arbitrations shall have the authority to impose sanctions as provided for by Rule 11.

If the DRP is unsuccessful for any of the Mass Arbitration Claimants, counsel for the Mass Arbitration Claimants and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. shall each select up to five (5) Mass Arbitration Claimants to proceed to individual arbitration (the “bellwether arbitrations”), each with a different arbitrator. No other arbitrations shall be commenced, and any non-bellwether arbitrations that may be pending shall promptly be dismissed voluntarily and without prejudice. The bellwether arbitrations shall commence immediately upon the dismissal of all non-bellwether arbitrations.  All bellwether arbitrations shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 1.3, above, shall require a reasoned decision from the arbitrator, and must be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days from commencement unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator or agreed to by the parties.

Upon the resolution of the bellwether arbitrations, counsel for Littleton Coin Company, Inc. and counsel for the Mass Arbitration Claimants shall participate promptly and in good faith in a non-binding confidential mediation for a period of sixty (60) days in a good faith effort to resolve all Disputes of the non-bellwether Mass Arbitration Claimants with the assistance of a mediator from JAMS or the AAA acceptable to both sides. All fees and costs assessed by the mediator and mediation organization shall be split equally by the Mass Arbitration Claimants and Littleton Coin Company, Inc.

To the extent necessary to preserve any Dispute asserted in the Statements, all statutes of limitation shall be suspended for all Mass Arbitration Claimants for the duration of the informal settlement process, the bellwether arbitrations, and mediation.

Those Mass Arbitration Claimants whose claims have not been resolved upon the conclusion of mediation may only pursue their disputes in small claims court (if the claim so qualifies) or in a documents-only arbitration with FairClaims, Inc. (“FairClaims”) under its Small Claims or Fast Track arbitration rules depending on the amount of the claim, information about which is available here. The decisions obtained in the bellwether arbitration may be submitted in connection with FairClaims arbitrations for their persuasive value only, and shall not be binding in any arbitration with FairClaims or in any other arbitration or court proceeding.

If FairClaims is for any reason whatsoever unavailable, unable, or unwilling to handle any arbitration assigned to it under these Mass Arbitration Rules, counsel for the Mass Arbitration Claimants and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. shall negotiate in good faith for the substitution of an alternative arbitrator or arbitration organization to conduct documents-only arbitrations in conformity with the requirements of these Mass Arbitration Rules with a cost structure, fees, and procedure comparable to those of FairClaims. If the parties are unable to agree on an alternative to FairClaims, the Mass Arbitration Claimants and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. shall have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator or arbitration organization to conduct documents-only arbitrations under the Mass Arbitration Rules consistent with the requirements of this Arbitration Agreement, with a cost structure, fees, and procedure comparable to those of FairClaims. To the extent consistent with the assertion or defense of any claim asserted in a Mass Arbitration, all parties agree that they will prioritize the minimization of costs in each aspect of the arbitral process.

If these Mass Arbitration Rules are determined to be unenforceable for any reason in a decision of any arbitrator or court as to which further review is foreclosed and all motions, appeals, and petitions for review have been resolved fully (a “Final Determination”), then you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. agree that all unresolved Disputes between Mass Arbitration Claimants and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. must be filed in and resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction in New Hampshire on an individual basis only, and not as part of a class proceeding, with the defending parties reserving the right to remove the case to federal court if the case qualifies for removal. In such case, the Dispute shall not be filed in, pursued further, or resolved through arbitration or otherwise be subject to any contractual obligation to arbitrate. To the extent that any arbitrations filed by or on behalf of Mass Arbitration Claimants are still pending at the time of a Final Determination, those arbitrations shall be dismissed immediately without prejudice and no further arbitrations shall be initiated by or on behalf of any Mass Arbitration Claimants. A court finding that any part of these Mass Arbitration Rules is unenforceable for any reason, including any Final Determination, shall have no effect on the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of these Terms.

1.6 Fees and Costs

You and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. agree that each party will bear its own costs and attorneys’ fees in the event of a Dispute, provided, however, that either party may recover fees and costs to the extent permitted by applicable law. If a court or an arbitrator determines that an arbitration has been brought or threatened in bad faith, or that the demand was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose, the court or arbitrator may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, award attorneys’ fees to the party defending against the claim just as a court could.

1.7 Improperly Commenced Arbitration or Litigation

If either party believes that the other has initiated an arbitration or litigation in violation of this Arbitration Agreement, if such an arbitration or litigation is threatened, or if either party has reason to believe an improperly commenced arbitration is imminent, the party against whom the arbitration or litigation has been or will be initiated may seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the arbitration or litigation from being filed or continued, and awarding its fees and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with seeking such relief.

1.8 No Class Actions

Except as expressly provided in the Mass Arbitration Rules, we both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis. This means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator cannot combine multiple people’s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an arbitrator’s decision or award in one Claimant’s case can only decide the disputes of that Claimant, not other Claimants. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement limits the parties’ rights to resolve Disputes by mutual agreement through a class-wide settlement of claims.

1.9 Additional Terms

All provisions of this Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of any contract between you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. Except as provided for in Subsection 1.5, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is held to be unenforceable or void for any reason, that provision shall be deemed severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches the intent of the original provision as closely as possible. If the parties cannot agree on such a provision, the arbitrator (or court, if applicable) shall have the authority to fashion such a provision. The remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall remain in full force. The validity and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement shall be determined separately from and without reference to any other provision of the Terms.

1.10 Subsequent Changes to Arbitration Agreement

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms, if Littleton Coin Company, Inc. changes the terms of this Arbitration Agreement after the date you last agreed to these Terms, you may reject this change by sending a written notice to Littleton Coin Company, Inc. expressly stating “I reject this change to the Arbitration Agreement,” or words to that effect to [\[email protected\]](https://www.littletoncoin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or by sending a letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, to Yvonne Burlock, Director of Fulfillment, 1309 MT Eustis Road Littleton, NH 03561 within thirty (30) days after you first agree to the version of the Terms which includes such changes. Your communication must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Littleton Coin Company, Inc. in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you previously indicated acceptance to these Terms.
