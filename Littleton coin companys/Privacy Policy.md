For additional information and to request deletion of your personal information, you may [click this link to our "Your Privacy Choices"](https://www.littletoncoin.com/shop/Your-Privacy-Choices) page, or you may send an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.littletoncoin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or call us at [1-800-645-3122](tel:1-800-645-3122).

How to Exercise Your Privacy Rights
-----------------------------------

When you contact us to exercise your rights to know, delete or correct your personal information, we will first verify your identity by asking you to confirm a few pieces of information we have in our records, such as your email address, phone number or address. With a request to correct, we may require information from you to demonstrate that our information is incorrect. This information shall only be used and/or maintained by the business for the purpose of correcting your personal information and to comply with any record-keeping obligations we may have under the law.

You may use an authorized agent to exercise your opt-out rights described above. For avoidance of doubt, parents may make a verifiable request on behalf of their minor child to exercise any consumer rights described in this policy.

You may make a verifiable consumer request up to two times within a 12-month period, without charge. Unfortunately, we cannot respond to your request to delete or correct, or provide you with personal information, if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt, and an opt-out request will be processed within 15 business days. If we require more time to respond to a verifiable consumer request, we will inform you of the reason and extension time period (up to 90 days). If you have an account with us, we will deliver our response to the email associated with that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our response by mail or electronically, at your option. The response we provide will also explain any reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

You have a right to appeal any denial of a consumer right. If your request is denied in whole or in part, you have the right to appeal your decision within 30 days. We will review and respond to your request within 45 days, and if your appeal is denied, we will provide you with an explanation of our reasons and a description of any further rights you may have at that time.

Right to Equal Service: We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights as a consumer under any applicable laws. Unless permitted by law, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by law that can result in different prices, rates or quality levels. Any legally permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
