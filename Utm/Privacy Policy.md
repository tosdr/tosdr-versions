Third Party

When UTM is launched for the first time after an update, a single request to `api.github.com` is made in order to fetch the release notes. If update checking is enabled, a request to `api.github.com` will be made on each launch.

GitHub may collect IP addresses of clients that connect to their API services and [their privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#how-github-uses-your-information) states that they “may use your information to provide, administer, analyze, manage, and operate our Service.”
