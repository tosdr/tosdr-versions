This website doesn’t track anything, and doesn’t set any cookies. I don’t track statistics beyond what is done by the Apache webserver. I occasionally look at high level statistics through [Analog](https://analog.readthedocs.io/) or [AWStats](https://www.awstats.org/) processing of those logs.

Search functionality is provided by a javascript application hosted within this website, and doesn’t rely on any external services or data providers. Nothing is tracked about what you search for, what your search results are, nor what you click on (aside from the webserver logs). Search results are sorted by relevance (somehow), and are not altered in any way based on your identity or browsing history.
