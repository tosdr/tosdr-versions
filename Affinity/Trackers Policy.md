#### How do we collect Personal Data?

##### Our Website:

* When you visit Our Website, we use cookies ([see below for more information about cookies](#cookies)) to collect website usage information such as the type and version of browser and operating system you use. Cookies are not used to store personal details such as your name and address.
* When you sign up to receive our newsletters, or to take part in our free public betas, or download a free trial of our software, or make a purchase on Our Website, or sign up to the Affinity Forum, an account is created which may include your name, email address, IP address, and other Personal Data. Please do not share your username or account details with any third party; we will not be liable in such circumstances for any data breach or loss.
* When making a physical purchase, we may need to collect your shipping address. With your consent, we will also store some details related to your payment method to speed up your checkout experience in the future. You’ll be able to remove these details at any time via your account. When making any store purchase your IP address will be used to save your location/region for tax and statistical purposes.

##### Our applications:

Affinity applications collect some anonymous information, for example usage data, application name and version number, language and OS version but no Personal Data. This is used to ensure correct content is shown in the welcome screen of the applications and to help notify you of product updates. Using the “My Account” feature within the application collects additional personal information to facilitate the functions, including data about your hardware.

We will also collect crash report data, but only if you choose to submit it to us at the time.

In addition to this our beta versions of the applications will automatically send additional data to help diagnose issues including GFX card information, Direct X data, CPU info and platform patches.

#### Why do we process and store your Personal Data?

We will only ever collect and use your Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Legislation. Our grounds for processing your Personal Data are as follows:

* Contract  
    
    It may be necessary for us to capture and store your Personal Data to fulfil our contractual obligation to you. For example, we may need to retain a copy of your email address where it forms part of the product license you purchase from us.
    
* Legitimate Interests  
    
    Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation there is a concept of “legitimate interests” as a justification for processing your Personal Data, where we have good and fair reasons to do so in ways which do not adversely affect your interests and rights.
    
    Our legitimate interests for processing your Personal Data are:
    
    * To enable you to access and use Our Website, to provide access to your purchases and product keys, and to provide customer support where required.
    * To provide a personalized checkout experience on our store. We will use your country and geolocation data to display relevant services, and pricing in your local currency.
