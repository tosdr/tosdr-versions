**1. SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY**

This Privacy Policy is part of the Terms of Service for the Application and includes any separate privacy notices and/or notices posted on particular pages of the Application that may provide more detail regarding the information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.  No matter where your information is collected, used, transferred or stored, if it was collected through the Application, it will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**Information We Collect from Your Use of the Application**

**When you use the Application, it may use technology to automatically collect:**

* **In-app Purchase Information**
    

When you make in-app purchases ( e.g., Regular subscription, coins, etc.) in B612, we will collect related order information, including IP address, unique device identification code, order number, transaction time, product category and product price.  This information is collected when you provide us with your payment information to place an order through the Application.

* **Analytics Information.**
    

We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Application.  These tools collect information sent by your device to our Application, including the content and ads that you view or click, and other information that assists us in improving the Application.  We collect and use this analytics information in the aggregate with analytics information from other users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user.

* **Location Information.**
    

Upon your consent, we may collect different types of information about your general location (e.g., IP address, zip code) or more specific location information (e.g., precise location from your mobile GPS) through methods such as mobile “SDKs” which allows us to periodically determine your location, including your location relative to and within third-party merchant locations, and share such information with third parties, for purposes related to advertising (e.g., customized ads in the Application), analytics, attribution (e.g., measuring ad performance), and research.  You may prevent location information from being collected by this or other apps through your device settings (but this may affect the functionality of certain Application features).  We may collect this information when the Application runs in the background on your device.

* **Behavioral Advertising Information**
    

When you use the Application, we allow third-party companies to collect certain information.  These companies may utilize cookies, pixels, or other similar technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.  To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at [www.aboutads.info](https://www.aboutads.info/) and Networking Advertising Initiative at [www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

* **Log Information.**
    

When you use the Application, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs.  This may include:

\- Information on how you interact with the Application.

\- Your IP address.

\- Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.

* **Metadata.**
    

Metadata refers to technical data associated with user content.  Put simply, metadata is data that describes data.  For example, metadata can describe the analysis results of facial features, the characters in photos, and other elements contained in photos, which are generated and tagged by the computer algorithm and artificial intelligence.  When you use the Services, we will use photo metadata to provide you with certain features including precise “Facial Recognition,” “Key-Points Recognition, “ “Region Segmentation, “Content Tags” and other custom features based on a combination of these basic features.  We may use your photo metadata to provide you with more suitable filters and better photo effects when the Application processes your photos; we may also make use of the metadata to serve up more contextually relevant products or services to you.

* **Face Recognition.**
    

B612 uses face recognition technology to recognize faces in photos, videos, and camera experiences.

We detect facial marks to provide face recognition contents and facial manipulation features - specifically, to apply filters and makeup on the appropriate face position.

We do not use such information for identifying a specific person.  This information is processed in real-time for providing features of the Application.

Certain features (filters, effects, etc.) will send, store, use and process facial recognition information, metadata, or images to/on our servers, which may include designated portions of third-party cloud service providers’ servers that we control. We permanently deletes all such information when the initial purpose for collecting the facial image data no longer exists, or, if earlier, within **one (1**) years of your last interaction with us.

You must expressly consent to our collection and use of such facial recognition technology and data in order to use the Application and you may not use the Application without providing such express consent.

* **Device and Usage Information.**
    

We may collect device and usage information such as:

\- Precise geolocation data pertaining to users’ devices (only upon your consent), which may be expressed by latitude-longitude coordinates obtained through GPS tools, WiFi data, cell tower triangulation or other techniques (collectively, “Device Geolocation Data”) and linked to a device identifier, such IDFA for iOS devices or Android ID for Android devices.

\- Mobile ad identifiers such as iOS Identifier for Advertising(IDFA) and Android Advertising ID(AAID)

\- Other information about a user’s device, such as: device type (e.g., tablet, smartphone), operating system, IP address, network provider, mobile carrier, mobile browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Safari), other apps and SDKs installed on the device, timestamp, time zone, information about the speed, bearing, orientation, and altitude of a device, or other device-identifying information.

\- Information about the possible relationships among different devices.

\- Data about user activities (e.g., the pages you view, the time and duration of your activities in the App) that helps us determine how a user interacts with advertising or content, such as determining whether a user who viewed a particular advertisement ultimately purchased the advertised product or service.

We may collect this information when the Application runs in the background on your device.

If you do not want this information to be linked to your device, you may go to your device settings (which are somewhat different for iOS and Android devices) and opt out of interest-based or personalized advertising Click **[here](https://terms.snow.me/snow/OptOut)** for more information 

* **Local Storage.**
    

\- We may access metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your device.  This may include, for example, photographs and contacts for the purpose of inviting friends to use the Application.

* **Third-Party Social Media Site.**
    

\- If you choose, you can log in to the Application through certain third-party social media sites.  Any information that such social media site provides to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy. This information includes nickname and profile image.

* **Use of Information from Apple’s TrueDepth API.** <This clause applies to Apple device users only.>
    

B612 may use Apple’s TrueDepth camera to collect additional information from your device’s camera in order to deliver and improve features provided by B612 (such as photo, video, effects, and more).  The use of such information, to the extent including facial geometry information, is governed by the Face Recognition terms set forth above.

**Information Collection and Tracking Technologies**

* **Cookies (or mobile cookies).**  A cookie is a small file placed on your smartphone.  It may be possible to refuse to accept mobile cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your smartphone.  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Application.
    

* **Web Beacons.** Pages of the Application may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages and for other related app statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain app content and verifying system and server integrity).
