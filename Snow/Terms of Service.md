Don’t send people messages they don’t want to receive―especially if the message is mean.Be thoughtful about what you send a message and whom you send it to.

Be thoughtful about what you send a message and whom you send it to. It’s okay with us if someone takes a screenshot, but we can’t speak for you or your friends. B612 attempts to detect screenshots and notify the sender, but it doesn’t always work perfectly - and your friend can always capture the image with a camera.

Keep it legal. Don’t use B612 for any illegal shenanigans and if you’re under 18 or are messaging with someone who might be: keep your clothes on!

What not to send:

\- Pornography  
\- Nudity or sexually suggestive content involving minors (people under the age of 18)  
\- Minors engaged in activities that are physically dangerous and harmful  
\- Invasions of privacy  
\- Threats  
\- Harassment or Bullying  
\- Impersonation  
\- Self-Harm  
\- Violating these rules may result in the removal of content, the suspension of your account and being prohibited from using B612 in the future. 

In addition, the B612 service supports creators to publish and post content, and allows user to utilize content produced by the creator. The content provided is strictly managed through internal standards, following the privacy policy and terms and conditions of B612 so that there isn’t any problematic content.

Please take these rules seriously and honor them in the spirit in which they are intended. The rules will change and evolve along with the B612 user community. We will do our best to enforce them consistently and fairly, and ultimately, we’ll try to do what we think is best in each situation, at our own discretion.

The Jellies, including Free Jellies may expire after a certain period of time, which SNOW shall designate from time to time (“Expiration Date”). Any unused Jellies after the Expiration Date (“Expired Jellies”) will be cancelled and you can no longer use those Expired Jellies.
