Our goal in creating these rules is to accommodate the broadest range of self expression while balancing the need for B612 users to be able to use our service safely and enjoyably.

Don’t send people messages they don’t want to receive―especially if the message is mean.Be thoughtful about what you send a message and whom you send it to.

Be thoughtful about what you send a message and whom you send it to. It’s okay with us if someone takes a screenshot, but we can’t speak for you or your friends. B612 attempts to detect screenshots and notify the sender, but it doesn’t always work perfectly - and your friend can always capture the image with a camera.

Keep it legal. Don’t use B612 for any illegal shenanigans and if you’re under 18 or are messaging with someone who might be: keep your clothes on!

What not to send:

\- Pornography  
\- Nudity or sexually suggestive content involving minors (people under the age of 18)  
\- Minors engaged in activities that are physically dangerous and harmful  
\- Invasions of privacy  
\- Threats  
\- Harassment or Bullying  
\- Impersonation  
\- Self-Harm  
\- Violating these rules may result in the removal of content, the suspension of your account and being prohibited from using B612 in the future. 

In addition, the B612 service supports creators to publish and post content, and allows user to utilize content produced by the creator. The content provided is strictly managed through internal standards, following the privacy policy and terms and conditions of B612 so that there isn’t any problematic content.

Please take these rules seriously and honor them in the spirit in which they are intended. The rules will change and evolve along with the B612 user community. We will do our best to enforce them consistently and fairly, and ultimately, we’ll try to do what we think is best in each situation, at our own discretion.

Furthermore, the Jellies do not hold any "real world" value. You are granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable, non-exclusive license for personal use of the Jellies to purchase, access, or license certain Paid Services only. The Jellies do not represent a property interest of any kind and you do not have any ownership rights in the Paid Services purchased, accessed, or licensed with the Jellies.  

The Jellies will be provided to you by the means specified by B612 such as purchases, special offers, and the like. Details regarding the payment methods, units, and all other conditions regarding the Jellies will be decided by SNOW and displayed accordingly on the Services.

By accessing your account, you can manage your purchase, redemption, and acquisition of the Jellies and see your past and current Jellies transaction history as well as the remaining balance. 

Certain minimum and maximum limit may apply to purchases of the Jellies.

The Jellies cannot be exchanged or be used for any other purpose other than to purchase, access, or license certain Paid Services, including certain in-app contents related to the Services offered by SNOW. SNOW reserves the right to change the purchase price for the Jellies at any time, and the number of Jellies required for purchasing, accessing, or licensing the Paid Services will be determined by SNOW from time to time and displayed accordingly on the Services.

The Jellies may only be used by the account that purchased and/or earned them. Furthermore, the Jellies cannot be transferred between devices running on different operating systems even if used under the same account.

For avoidance of any doubt, the Jellies will not be redeemable for any sum of money from SNOW at any time. Upon expiration or termination of your account, any and all remaining Jellies shall be cancelled and expire on the termination date and can no longer be used by you.

SNOW may from time to time offer bonus or promotional Jellies that you do not pay for, including any Jellies we offer you in connection with any promotional activity ("Free Jellies"). The Jellies, including Free Jellies may expire after a certain period of time, which SNOW shall designate from time to time (“Expiration Date”). Any unused Jellies after the Expiration Date (“Expired Jellies”) will be cancelled and you can no longer use those Expired Jellies.

When you use the Jellies to purchase, access, or license the Paid Services, the Jellies you have in your account will be applied and used in the following order (the Jellies with the earliest Expiration Date being applied and used first):

(i)    Bonus Free Jellies
