### 1\. Personal Data Processed When You Use Our Website or Services Without Registration

When you are simply visiting our website for information, without registering or logging in, we may nonetheless collect data which may include Personal Data from you, through your browser, such as:

* IP address and corresponding network location
* Exact time (including timezone) of your request
* Metadata and contents of your request
* Details of your browser and operating system

We use the services provided by Functional Software, Inc’s [https://www.sentry.io](https://www.sentry.io/ "https://www.sentry.io") to enable our server maintenance and security team to analyse errors and potential threats in real time. The legal basis for this processing of your data is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, which allows the processing of data for our legitimate interests, that is technically required to ensure a stable, secure and functioning website. This data is deleted after 90 days. Additionally, we also store the aforementioned data locally for a period not exceeding 30 days.

SUSE uses a ChatBot function on [https://suse.com](https://suse.com/ "https://suse.com"). Should you choose to use this feature, the ChatBot may ask you to provide Personal Data in order to help you to provide you with information pertinent to the feedback that you enter in the ChatBot window. If you use SUSE’s ChatBot, we will process Personal Data such as your contact details to get in touch with you (e.g. if you are interested in one of our products or if you request support). Please note that the ChatBot allows free text entry so any Personal Data you enter will be processed. You are thus encouraged to refrain from entering Personal Data except as necessary and as prompted by the ChatBot. We ask you to never include sensitive categories of Personal Data (see Art 9 GDPR). If you choose to enter Personal Data in our ChatBot, we process such Personal Data under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. It is within SUSE’s legitimate interest to process such data in order to help you to provide you with information pertinent to the feedback that you enter in the ChatBot window. Given the minimum nature of the processing (see above), we believe that a fair balancing of our rights is attained. SUSE engages Qualified.com, Inc. to deploy ChatBot on our website. The data is processed in the United States. Data transfers between SUSE Group entities and Qualified.com, Inc. are also legitimated by a data processing agreement which adopts the Standard Contractual Clauses.

### 2\. Personal Data Processed When You Register for and Use Our Website or Services

In addition to the Personal Data collected when you use our website or services without registration, some functions of our website and services can only be used when you register and log in. The Personal Data we collect after your registration and/or logging in can include e.g.:

* Login credentials and related information such as security questions/answers or tokens

Such data is processed either based on a contract (Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR) or your consent (Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR). For the latter, you can revoke your consent at any time by sending us an informal message to the e-mail address listed above or by modifying your preferences accordingly on our website. Data collected during the registration or, for as long as your account continues, is stored by us for as long as you are registered on our website. Should you wish to terminate your account on our website you can do so at any time by sending a request via the [GDPR Web Form](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/8dbe264e-9e4e-4ec2-9cea-d3392eb265ee/d9cb3b85-2ce9-4358-8a11-cffb58d02e65 "GDPR Web Form"). Please note that terminating your account will mean you will no longer be able to use our services. Certain data such as forum contributions and comments may be retained longer. The legal basis for this processing of your data is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, which allows the processing of data to ensure e.g. a functioning and usable online services such as forums. Legal retention periods shall remain unaffected. To prevent misuse of our services, your IP address and the exact time of your registration and/or logging in will also be stored. The legal basis for this processing of your data is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, which allows the processing of data that is technically required to ensure a stable, secure and functioning website.

### 3\. Personal Data Processing for Visitors at SUSE Premises

When you visit SUSE premises, we use CCTV cameras for monitoring of access points for security and crime prevention purposes (e.g. to assist us in the identification and detection of offenders or for the investigation of a security incident). The controller of the processing of personal data by CCTV will always be the specific SUSE entity whose premises you are visiting. SUSE monitors only areas within our sphere of control and we avoid unnecessarily capturing public areas. There are signs in place to inform you where cameras are in use. Access to the video footage is strictly limited on a need-to-know basis within SUSE and subject to an approval process. Video footage might be supplied to the police if necessary for crime investigation purposes. The legal basis of this processing is Art 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, in particular protection of SUSE's tangible assets (e.g. laptops, servers, other HW, etc.), security of SUSE employees, products, etc.. We store such data for as long as necessary for the purposes mentioned above.

### 4\. Personal Data Processing for SUSE Candidates

**​​​​Purposes of Processing**

We use your Personal Data to decide whether to establish an employment relationship and to contact you. If the employment relationship does not materialise, we use your Personal Data to send you a rejection, typically using the same method you used to send us your application documents. The processing of your Personal Data is thus necessary pursuant to i.a. Article 6 (1)(b) and Article 88 GDPR, for the establishment of an employment relationship with you.

Should you choose to participate in the SUSE Talent Community (our pool of interested candidates), we will process your Personal Data in order to maintain a pool of candidates who wish to be considered and contacted with respect to future job offers. You can also opt to receive a newsletter as part of the SUSE Talent Community, which provides you with updates on SUSE job opportunities, company news and events. You can use the unsubscribe link in the individual newsletter emails to remove yourself from further mailings.

SUSE uses a ChatBot function on [https://jobs.suse.com](https://jobs.suse.com/ "https://jobs.suse.com"). Should you choose to use this feature, the ChatBot may ask you to provide Personal Data in order to help you search available jobs and to provide you with information pertinent to the feedback that you enter in the ChatBot window.

In order to streamline your application, SUSE offers you the opportunity to upload your resume from an existing cloud storage service, such as DropBox and SkyDrive. Should you choose to use this feature, SUSE must process Personal Data in order to technically facilitate this data transfer.

Our jobs platform processes certain information (which may include Personal Data such as IP or data which, when aggregated, may be unique and as such potentially personally identifiable) for the purpose of displaying job recommendations based on your browsing history.

It is also possible to login/register on SUSE’s job platform using your LinkedIn, Facebook or Google account. Should you choose to do so, we process your name, photo (where available) and primary email address as supplied by those platforms for the purpose of creating your profile on our jobs platform. You can stop this processing at any time in the settings of the relevant platform. In addition, when registering, SUSE’s platform will process Personal Data for the purpose of determining what current job opportunities are available that match your profile and in order to contact you with such job opportunities.

Finally, SUSE’s job platform automatically collects and processes technical information which may include Personal Data (IP or data which, when aggregated, may be unique and as such potentially personally identifiable) for the purpose of ensuring the technical stability of the platform and for identifying and mitigating potential security issues.

**Categories and Types of Personal Data Processed**

To apply, you will need to create an account on SUSE’s Workday platform. The platform requires at a minimum your contact details (such as name, email, country of residence, street name, house number, city, postal code, phone number), work history (job title, company, location, duration, role description), education (school/university, degree, field of study, overall result, duration), skills, resume (you can upload this and so you decide what Personal Data is included), any websites you decide are relevant to your application, confirmations regarding any employment history or relationship with various government bodies (for regulatory compliance), legal work status (work permit, residency permit/visa) and gender (you may choose ‘undeclared’).

If you choose to join SUSE’s Talent Community, you will be asked to provide your contact details (name, email, phone number, current employer, current title, country, city) and areas that interest you. You may also upload your resume or use DropBox or SkyDrive to transfer your resume.

If you use SUSE’s ChatBot, we will process Personal Data such as your location (to search job opportunities at that location). Should you choose to give us feedback on how useful the ChatBot is, we also process that information. Please note that the ChatBot allows free text entry so any Personal Data you enter will be processed. You are thus encouraged to refrain from entering Personal Data except as necessary and as prompted by the ChatBot. We ask you to never include sensitive categories of Personal Data (see Art 9 GDPR).

If you use LinkedIn, Facebook or Google to create or log in to your profile on SUSE’s job platform, we will process contact information that is supplied to us from such a platform - contact information (name, email, phone) as well as your current job description and skills. You may restrict or stop such processing at any time using the settings of the relevant platform.

**Legal Grounds for Processing**

When applying for a job through our SUSE jobs platform, the Personal Data we collect is necessary for the decision as to whether to establish an employment relationship with you. We cannot process incomplete applications. The categories and types of Personal Data that are necessary are marked as such (usually with a red asterisk) and it will not be possible to proceed without completing such fields. For such necessary Personal Data in the context of your job application, we process this Personal Data according to Article 6(1)(b) and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

If you choose to create a profile on our jobs platform or you join the SUSE Talent Community, we process such Personal Data under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR – i.e. we rely on your consent.

If you choose to enter Personal Data in our ChatBot, we process such Personal Data under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. It is within SUSE’s legitimate interest to process such data in order to match your input with the job opportunities currently available. Given the minimum nature of the processing (see above) we believe that a fair balancing of our rights is attained.

**Recipients of Personal Data**

Your application as well as any Personal Data you enter to join the SUSE Talent Community will be received and will be reviewed by SUSE’s hiring and talent managers and will be made available to the department leads and anyone else with a need to access the Personal Data to process and/or approve the job application (whereby this group of recipients will be kept to the minimum necessary).

**Processors of Personal Data**

SUSE engages Workday, (by Workday, Inc) as our Human Capital Management processor. The Workday tenant used by SUSE is located in Europe.

SUSE engages Phenom People, (by Phenom, Inc) as our Talent Experience Platform (which includes the ChatBot deployed on the SUSE jobs platform). The Phenom tenant used by SUSE is located in Europe.

When you contact SUSE directly (e.g. via email), we process your personal data such as name, surname, email address or company details in order to respond to your questions or requests (e.g. when you report a security vulnerability). The legal basis of this processing depends on the circumstances of the request and it might be Art 6 (1)(a) GDPR where we have received your consent, Art 6(1)(b) of the GDPR for the personal data we process that forms the basis of a contract as well as Art 6(1)(f) of the GDPR which allows the processing of data for our security purposes.

We delete your data once it is not necessary anymore in accordance with our internal data retention schedule.

### 9\. SUSE Customer Center

Such Personal Data can include your contact details (e.g. name, email, telephone, address) and account creation and maintenance details (e.g. username, password, security questions). We use this Personal Data in order to create and maintain your account on our Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) systems, to allow you to file and track support incidents (e.g. through our web interface or through our live support tools), to upload error and telemetry data associated with your support incidents and to statistically evaluate the effectiveness of the support that we provide to our customers.

We keep your account related Personal Data as well as any Personal Data which you voluntarily add to the support incident for the duration of your support agreement with us. With respect to error and telemetry data (e.g. log files, memory dumps) you send to us, you must ensure that these, under no circumstances contain Personal Data. We delete such data within 30 days after the incident is resolved and so you must take steps to back up any such data before sending it to us.

### 11\. Live Chat

To provide you with the ability to have a real time chat with one of our representatives, we have integrated the functionality provided by the third party provider LiveChat. In order to use this function, we collect your consent (Art 6(1)(a) of the GDPR) to provide certain Personal Data such as your name and email. We do this to ensure a personal experience, and to ensure that we can send you a record of your chat. Additionally, the service may automatically store some further information such as operating system, device type and application version.

### 12\. Newsletter

You can subscribe to our newsletter, through which we inform you about our products, services and offers. We rely on your consent to subscribe and fulfill your newsletter request. We use a “double opt-in" procedure to subscribe you to our newsletter. After your initial subscription, we send an email to the email address you subscribed with, requesting your confirmation (e.g. by replying to the email or clicking a link therein). If you don’t confirm the subscription within the relevant time period, your subscription request will be automatically deleted. We also store the IP address you used and the time of registration and confirmation to enable us to verify your subscription and to prevent misuse. The legal basis for this processing of your data is Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, which allows the processing of data for our legitimate interests, that is technically required to ensure a stable, secure and functioning website.

Your email address is mandatory and necessary both to enable verification of your subscription request and actual sending of newsletter emails to you. Any other data you send us is entirely voluntary. After your confirmation, we store your email address to send you the newsletter. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1)(a) of the GDPR. You can revoke your consent for the newsletter any time and also unsubscribe from it. You can perform the revocation by clicking on the link provided in each email or by modifying your preferences accordingly on our website.

We may evaluate your user behaviour when we send you the newsletter, using "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags or clear GIFs). These web beacons allow us to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page and the information in cookies set by the third party. We may link the information collected from you above with that obtained from web beacons in newsletters to:

* Understand which email messages we sent may have been opened by you;
* Understand how you use and interact with our products and services;
* Improve our products and services;
* Optimise your html email experience;
* Provide you more relevant content; and
* Stop contacting you if over time we can see that you are no longer opening our email messages.

If you wish to prevent the use of web beacons, you may be able to prevent the use of some web beacons by setting your email application or software to display HTML emails as text only.

**DoubleClick Ad Exchange**

While we do not incorporate code or functionality from DoubleClick, this website uses the online marketing tool DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick uses cookies to display adverts that are relevant to the user, to improve reports on campaign performance, and to avoid users being shown the same adverts multiple times. Via a cookie ID, Google records which adverts are displayed in which browser and is thus able to prevent the adverts from being shown multiple times. Furthermore, with the aid of cookie IDs, DoubleClick can record conversions relating to ad requests. This is the case, for example, when a user sees a DoubleClick advert and later visits the advertiser’s website using the same browser and makes a purchase on that website. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies contain no personal information.

Through the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected through use of this tool by Google and are therefore providing you with information based on what we know: Through the integration of DoubleClick, Google receives the information that you have accessed the relevant section of our website or that you have clicked on one of our adverts. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can link the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or are not logged in, the provider may learn and store your IP address.

You can prevent participation in this tracking process in a number of ways: a) by configuring your browser software accordingly; in particular, the suppression of third-party cookies means that you will not receive adverts from third-party providers; b) by disabling the cookies for conversion tracking, by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain "googleadservices.com", at [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads "https://www.google.com/settings/ads"); this setting is deleted if you delete your cookies; c) by disabling interest-related adverts from providers who are part of the "About Ads" self-regulation campaign via the link [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices "http://www.aboutads.info/choices"); this setting is deleted if you delete your cookies; d) by permanently deactivating your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome browser at the link [http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin "http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin"). Please note that in this case, you may not be able to fully use all the functions on this website.

The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6(1)(f) and Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR. Further information on DoubleClick by Google is available at [https://www.google.com/doubleclick](https://www.google.com/doubleclick "https://www.google.com/doubleclick"), and on data protection in general at Google: [https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy "https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy").

**AdDaptive Intelligence**

AdDaptive Intelligence, Inc. (AdDaptive) provides digital advertising services to brands, advertising agencies, and digital publishers through the use of our technology platform (Platform). AdDaptive's Platform, which is used on behalf of clients (Clients), manages digital advertisements across many channels, such as third-party websites, mobile apps, online video, streaming audio and streaming TV.

When the AdDaptive technology is deployed on Client websites (Client Sites) and the user is located outside of the EEA, the Platform automatically receives information from the Client Site through the use of pixels tags and cookies.

Additionally, publisher and advertiser clients, as well as data providers, and our Demand Side Platform partner (Xandr), provide AdDaptive with Platform Data to support advertising transactions. The Platform Data may include cookies from the adnxs.com domain which you can learn more about by visiting [https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/xandr/digital-platform-cookie-policy](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/xandr/digital-platform-cookie-policy "https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/xandr/digital-platform-cookie-policy"). The AdDaptive Privacy Policy provides more information about Platform Data, and opting out of the use of cookies.

**Social Media Plug-ins**

We currently use the following social media plug-ins on our website:

* Facebook
* X (former Twitter)
* LinkedIn

We use the two-click solution. This means that when you visit our site, no personal data is sent initially to the plug-in providers. You can identify the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box, via the provider’s initial letters or logo. We give you the opportunity to communicate directly with the plug-in provider via the button. The plug-in provider will receive the information that you have visited the relevant page on our website only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it. In addition, the data will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook and Xing, according to these providers, the IP address is anonymised immediately after being collected in Germany. When the plug-in is activated, your personal data is therefore sent to the relevant plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of US providers, in the USA). Because the plug-in providers carry out data collection using cookies, we recommend deleting all cookies via the security settings in your browser before clicking on the greyed-out box.

We have no influence on the data collected or on the data processing operations, nor do we know the full scope of the data collection, the purposes of the processing or the retention periods. We also have no information regarding the erasure of the collected data by the plug-in providers.

The plug-in provider stores the data collected regarding you as usage profiles and uses these for advertising and market research purposes and/or for ensuring that its website is designed in accordance with requirements. Such use is carried out (including for users who are not logged in) for the purposes of displaying appropriate advertising and informing other users on the social network about your activities on our website. You have a right to object to the creation of these user profiles. To assert this right, you must contact the relevant plug-in provider. Via the plug-ins, we offer you the opportunity to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve the experience we offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of plug-ins is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR.

The data transfer takes place irrespective of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged into your account. If you are logged into your account with the plug-in provider, your data collected on our website will be linked directly to this account. If you click on the activated button and e.g. link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend regularly logging out after using a social network, before activating the button, as in this way you can prevent a link being made by the plug-in provider to your profile.

Further information on the purpose and scope of the collection and processing of data by the plug-in provider is available in the privacy policies of these providers listed below. In these privacy policies, you can also find further information on your associated rights and setting options for protecting your privacy.

**Integration of YouTube Videos**

We may integrate YouTube videos in our website. These videos are stored on [http://www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/ "http://www.youtube.com") and can be played directly from our website. The videos are all integrated in "enhanced data protection mode", meaning that no data regarding you as a user is transmitted to YouTube if you do not play the videos. The data is transmitted only when you play the videos. We have no influence over this data transmission.

Through the visit to the website, YouTube receives the information that you have accessed the relevant page on our website. In addition, the data will be transmitted. This takes place irrespective of whether you have a user account with YouTube that you are logged into or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in on Google, your data will be linked directly to your account. If you do not want your data to be linked to your YouTube profile, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as usage profiles and uses it for advertising and market research purposes and/or for ensuring that its website is designed in accordance with requirements. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide appropriate advertising and to inform other users on the social network about your activities on our website. You have a right to object to the creation of these user profiles. To assert this right, you must contact YouTube.

Further information on the purpose and scope of the collection and processing of data by YouTube is available in the privacy policy. Here, you can also find further information on your rights and setting options for protecting your privacy: [https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy "https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy").
