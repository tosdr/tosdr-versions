2\. Use of the Site and Service Generally
-----------------------------------------

(a) Spreadshirt owns all intellectual property and other rights, title and interest in and to its site and service (except for user-provided content). Your use of the site and service does not grant you any right, title or interest to these properties, except as follows. Spreadshirt grants you a limited, revocable license to access and use the site and service for its intended purpose: the provision of an online, on-demand, customizable merchandising solution. You may only use the site and service according to Spreadshirt's terms, rules, and guidelines found on its site, and Spreadshirt may revoke this license and limit your access to the site and service according to Section 15 (Termination of Access).  
  
(b) You may not

1. interfere with the site and service by using viruses or any other programs or technology designed to disrupt or damage any software or hardware;
2. modify, copy, create derivative works from, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any technology used to provide the site and service;
3. use a robot or other automated means to monitor the activity on or copy information or pages from the site and service, except search engines, traffic counters, or similar basic performance monitoring technology;
4. impersonate another person or entity;
5. use any meta tags, search terms, keywords, or similar tags that contain Spreadshirt's name or trademarks;
6. engage in any activity that interferes with another user's ability to use or enjoy the site and service, including activity that places a disproportionate burden on the site and service compared to ordinary use from a single, ordinary user;
7. assist or encourage any third party in engaging in any activity prohibited by this agreement; or
8. use the site and service to promote hate speech, obscenity, or any content that violates [Spreadshirt's Ethical Guidelines,](https://www.spreadshirt.com/community-standards-C3529) which Spreadshirt may change from time to time in Spreadshirt's sole discretion.

3\. Shops
---------

(a) Two shop types are available on Spreadshirt's site. First, there are shops designed and operated by Spreadshirt itself ("Spreadshirt Shop(s)") and shops designed and operated by independent shop owners ("Partner Shop(s)"). Information about the owner of any shop is available as a linked page in each shop.  
  
(b) Independent shop owners of Partner Shops are solely responsible for the products and designs offered in those shops, the design of those shops, and the advertising of the articles offered. Spreadshirt does not use designs or products of shop owners until a customer places an order that includes one of those designs or products.  
  

4\. Product Sales
-----------------

(a) By placing an order using Spreadshirt's site and service, a customer makes a binding offer for a contract of sale or, as the case may be, a contract for work and materials with Spreadshirt only (no contract exists between the customer and any applicable shop owner). Spreadshirt sends an order confirmation via e-mail to the customer. The order confirmation is not an acceptance of the offer, but only acknowledges that the order was received. The offer is only accepted when Spreadshirt confirms that production has completed in a second e-mail. Spreadshirt cannot guarantee the continued availability of any products or designs found on its site.  
  
(b) Information, drawings, figures, technical data, specifications of weight, measurements and services contained in brochures, catalogues, newsletters, ads, or price lists are purely informational. Spreadshirt cannot guarantee the correctness of this information, and if there is any inconsistency between the information described above and the information in an order confirmation email, the order confirmation email controls.  
  
(c) Spreadshirt reserves the right to reject orders for any reason or no reason. If Spreadshirt rejects an order, it will notify the customer.  
  
(d) Spreadshirt's performance of an order is completed when the shipment provider completes delivery to the customer's address, according to the records of the shipment provider. If there is an interruption of delivery, and Spreadshirt cannot replace the order in a reasonable amount of time, Spreadshirt will notify the customer immediately.  
  
(e) If there is a product defect or if you are dissatisfied with your order for any reason, [Spreadshirt's return policy](https://service.spreadshirt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000984869) will apply, which Spreadshirt may change at any time in its sole discretion.

5\. Delivery & Shipment
-----------------------

(a) Spreadshirt warrants that it will ship orders within three weeks after orders are placed. Normally, goods are shipped within a few days and typical delivery times are 2-4 days, but in certain circumstances shipment and delivery can take up to three weeks. Customers and Spreadshirt may separately agree to more specific delivery times and terms in a separate writing or agreement (such as a request for express shipping).  
  
(b) Spreadshirt will make delivery using a shipment service provider of its choosing. The customer must pay standard shipping costs which may depend on order value and shipping destinations. Shipping costs are displayed at checkout.

6\. Prices
----------

(a) All prices found on Spreadshirt's site are final, and may change from time to time. Shipping and handling are billed and shown separately at checkout (or on invoices, if applicable). The shipping address and order amount may affect certain costs, and sales taxes may apply to some orders.  
  
(b) For customers ordering from outside the United States, all product prices are net of local taxes and fees. If, according to applicable law, the goods are subject to sales taxes, import duties, import brokerage fees, or other taxes or fees in the recipient's country, then the customer has the sole responsibility to pay these taxes and fees.  
  
(c) Customers must pay the purchase price, applicable sales taxes, and shipping and handling charges immediately upon placing an order, without deduction.

7\. Payment
-----------

(a) Customers may choose to pay by direct debit, credit card, advance payment, or other payment methods. Spreadshirt reserves the right to limit the method of payment chosen by the customer depending on order value, shipment destination, or other objective criteria.  
  
(b) If the customer selects a payment method or provides payment information that makes it impossible or impractical for Spreadshirt to receive payment (for example, the customer's account lacks sufficient funds, or the customer provided incorrect payment information) through no fault of Spreadshirt's own, the customer agrees that Spreadshirt may add an additional charge to the order to recoup costs associated with processing or attempting to process the impossible or impractical transaction.  
  
(c) Spreadshirt may sub-contract third parties to process payment.  
  
(d) If the customer fails to pay, Spreadshirt may assign its claims to a debt collection agency and transfer the personal data required for collecting payment to these third parties.

8\. Title to Products
---------------------

Until Spreadshirt receives full payment for an order and the order is shipped, title to the goods remains with Spreadshirt. Upon transfer of the goods to the carrier, title and risk of loss passes to the customer. The customer should handle products with care until the transfer of ownership is complete (for example, in case of a product return).

9\. Disclaimers

Spreadshirt may, in its sole discretion, refuse to print any designs or text that you submit. However, Spreadshirt is not obligated to review any of your submissions.  
  
(b) You agree to (i) indemnify and (ii) release Spreadshirt from all liability (including costs and attorney's fees) for claims relating to the alleged or actual infringement of any third-party rights and any law to the extent that such claims relate to your use of Spreadshirt's site and service.

13\. Dispute Resolution
-----------------------

(a) The formation, construction, and performance of this agreement (and all other agreements incorporating this agreement by reference) must be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and Massachusetts without regard to their choice of law rules. The parties agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement must be submitted to confidential binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts, except that Spreadshirt may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in Massachusetts if you have violated or threatened to violate the intellectual property rights of Spreadshirt or a third party, or any term of any agreement you have with Spreadshirt. The parties agree that

1. the arbitration will be provided by an alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree, then through the American Arbitration Association;
2. claims must be conducted on an individual basis, and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action; and
3. any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator is final, binding, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) If any action or claim is filed in contravention of the arbitration rules provided in paragraph 13(a), the parties agree to personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts of Massachusetts, Suffolk County, and both waive the right to a jury trial. All claims filed or brought contrary to paragraph 13(a) are improperly filed, and the non-filing party is entitled to recover all attorneys fees and costs relating to dismissal of the improperly filed claim incurred after the non-filing party has given notice in writing of the improperly filed claim. 

14\. Digital Millennium Copyright Act
-------------------------------------

Spreadshirt will respond to legitimate requests under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (**"DMCA"**), and retains the right to deny service to any user if in Spreadshirt's sole discretion, the usage or content poses a risk of allegations of infringement of the copyright (or other intellectual property right) of others.

The parties have not relied on any representations or promises relating to the subject matter of this agreement except those contained within the four corners of this agreement.  
  
(b) Relationship of Parties.
