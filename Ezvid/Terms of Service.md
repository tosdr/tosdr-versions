DMCA Copyright Policy
---------------------

Ezvid has adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement on the Services in accordance with the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](http://www.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf) (the "**DMCA**"). The address of Ezvid's Designated Agent for copyright takedown notices ("**Designated Agent**") is listed below. You may submit a notice under the DMCA using our [copyright notice form](http://www.ezvid.com/contact).

Reporting Instances of Copyright Infringement:
----------------------------------------------

If you believe that Content residing or accessible on or through the Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent at the address below:

1. Identification of the work or material being infringed.
2. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including its location, with sufficient detail so that Ezvid is capable of finding it and verifying its existence.
3. Contact information for the notifying party (the "Notifying Party"), including name, address, telephone number, and email address.
4. A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law.
5. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.
6. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed.

Please also note that the information provided in a notice of copyright infringement may be forwarded to the Subscriber who posted the allegedly infringing content. After removing material pursuant to a valid DMCA notice, Ezvid will immediately notify the Subscriber responsible for the allegedly infringing material that it has removed or disabled access to the material. Ezvid will terminate, under appropriate circumstances, the Accounts of Subscribers who are repeat copyright infringers, and reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate any Subscriber for actual or apparent copyright infringement.

Submitting a DMCA Counter-Notification:
---------------------------------------

If you believe you are the wrongful subject of a DMCA notification, you may file a counter-notification with Ezvid by providing the following information to the Designated Agent at the address below:

* The specific URLs of material that Ezvid has removed or to which Ezvid has disabled access.
* Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
* A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or the federal district courts located in Los Angeles County, California if your address is outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
* The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
* Your signature.

Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, Ezvid will forward it to Notifying Party who submitted the original DMCA notification. The original Notifying Party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then have ten (10) days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action relating to the allegedly infringing material. If Ezvid does not receive any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material to the Services.
