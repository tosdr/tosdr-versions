When we Process Personal Data on behalf of our customers in the performance of a contract, the customer’s privacy policy applies to such Processing. NCR VOYIX relies on its customers to provide NCR VOYIX with Processing instructions that comply with those customers’ privacy obligations to you.

‍

##### Use of Personal Data

‍

NCR VOYIX is committed to collecting Personal Data for specified and legitimate purposes, to limit its Processing to the stated purpose, and to not Process that data further in a manner incompatible with such purpose.

‍

**Lawful Bases for NCR Voyix Processing.**

‍

NCR Voyix will use Personal Data where reasonably necessary to fulfill NCR Voyix's business needs (as described below), including to:

* Perform a contract with you or take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract;
* Comply with a regulatory or legal obligation;
* Protect your vital interests or that of another natural person;
* Perform a task carried out in the public interest;
* Carry out Processing with your consent, which you may withdraw at any time as described below;
* Further a legitimate interest of NCR Voyix or a third party including, but not limited to:
* Researching and developing products, services, marketing or security procedures to improve their performance, resilience, reliability or efficiency;
* Auditing related to transactions, short-term transient use in accordance with applicable law, debugging to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality and undertaking activities to verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device;
* Detecting security incidents, protecting NCR Voyix personnel, property and assets from malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity including threats or harm including to NCR Voyix's information technology infrastructure, Intellectual property, or goodwill or reputation and prosecuting those responsible for that activity;
* Ensuring compliance with relevant corporate policies and terms; or
* Optimizing utilization of global corporate resources including the administration of business transactions, personnel and information technology systems

**Additional Business Purposes.**

In addition to the foregoing, NCR Voyix may Process Personal Data in the following specific purposes and circumstances:

* **Contract Data.** As described above, NCR Voyix will use Contract Data consistent with applicable contractual obligations with its customers and applicable law. NCR Voyix also may use Contract Data to facilitate compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.
* **Deidentified Data.** For deidentified or aggregated data, which was formerly Personal Data, but which can no longer identify individuals, NCR Voyix may conduct research and development, statistical, trend or pattern analysis in order to continuously improve our products, services, processes, and security procedures.
* **Sales and Marketing.** NCR Voyix may use your Personal Data for sales and marketing purposes, including contacting you for feedback in customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes, providing you with marketing literature on products and services, notifying you of events, and providing you with information about NCR Voyix . You may always change your privacy preferences as set forth below. From time to time, NCR VOYIX may co-brand an offering or a communication with a third party, which may also collect your Personal Data. In such cases, the use of your Personal Data by such third parties is covered by their respective privacy policies, and not this Privacy Policy. In cases where you choose to forward a page from this website to another individual (where such option is available), NCR Voyix may request certain Personal Data about that individual to complete your request, such as name and email address, but NCR VOYIX will not make further use of such information. NCR Voyix's use may include, but is not limited to, making sales calls, sending marketing communications, delivering or completing requested services or transactions, and tracking and analyzing a series of transactions.
* **Social Networking Tools.** If NCR Voyix uses social networking widgets or tools to provide information to you, your information will be governed by the terms of use and the privacy policy for the applicable social networking platform.
* **Fulfilling Business Transactions.** NCR Voyix may use your Personal Data to fulfil business transaction requests with you or your organization. With respect to our customers, such requests may include, but are not limited to, maintaining or servicing accounts, verifying customer information, processing payments, providing advertising and marketing services, providing analytics services, undertaking internal research of technological development and demonstration, providing products or services including delivering notifications of product issues, fixes or updates, or contacting you in response to your questions, comments, or requests. With respect to our suppliers, such requests may include issuing purchase orders, receiving invoices, or providing other information such as forecasts. If, in providing service or support (including support to assist you with the use of our websites or applications), we engage you telephonically or via electronic communications through tools such as email or online chat, we may monitor or record our interactions for purposes of quality assurance, training, or to document the details of the interaction or transaction.
* **Recruitment.** If you seek employment with NCR Voyix , you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume. We may utilize automated processing techniques for candidate applications for qualitative scoring or ranking to optimize the efficiency of our recruiting practices. In such cases, however, this Processing is overseen by our Human Resources personnel. We may use this information throughout NCR VOYIX to consider you for employment purposes and may keep your information on file for future consideration, to support NCR Voyix's compliance with applicable legal requirements, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or in a separate notice that may be provided to you.

##### Transfers

‍

NCR Voyix is a global company with global operations, partners and suppliers. Where it is necessary for the efficient and effective performance of a business transaction or the fulfilment of one of the uses of Personal Data outlined above, NCR Voyix may need to transfer Personal Data from the country of collection to other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. Where such a transfer is made from one country or territory to another that is not deemed by the first exporting country (“Exporting Country”) to offer an adequate level of protection to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, NCR Voyix's policy is to do so on the basis of contractual controls between the relevant group companies, partners, or suppliers designed to ensure that substantially the same level of protection is afforded to the Personal Data as in the Exporting Country. NCR Voyix's contractual safeguards are based on the ‘standard contractual clauses’ issued by the European Commission and other data protection regulatory authorities of the Exporting Country.

‍

##### Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties

‍

We may share your Personal Data (including Contract Data) with the following categories of third parties:

‍

**Affiliates.** We may share Personal Data within NCR Voyix.

Examples of categories of suppliers include:, IT vendors (including IT and related services, security product providers, email providers, and application providers), customer service providers, contingent workers, consultants, and other vendors to support the provision of our products and services. It is NCR Voyix's practice to enter into contracts with our suppliers and service providers that require them to handle your information in a manner consistent with NCR Voyix policy and applicable law.

‍

**Business Partners.** We may provide Personal Data to business partners with whom we jointly offer products or services. In such cases, our business partner’s name may appear along with ours.

‍

**Advertising Partners.** Third parties do not advertise on NCR Voyix's websites. NCR Voyix, however, may contract with third parties who collect information about your online activities over time and across different devices and websites (including NCR Voyix websites). These third parties use cookies or web beacons across multiple websites, including NCR Voyix's websites, to collect certain information about you (e.g., your IP address, mobile identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day) to provide you with targeted ads based on your interests. We engage with these third parties to help us deliver targeted advertisements about NCR Voyix on other websites you visit. If we need to facilitate these third parties to place cookies on your device to enable this functionality, we will do so in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, the third parties’ collection, use, and disclosures of your information is governed by their own privacy policies and statements. You have several choices to control the delivery of targeted ads to you by NCR Voyix, as described below. In certain jurisdictions, you have the right to opt out of targeted advertising.

‍

**Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale or Other Asset Transfer**. From time to time, NCR Voyix may contemplate entering into various business development activities which may include the sale, purchase, merger, or reorganization of one or more of its businesses. These business development activities may require the disclosure of Personal Data to the prospective or actual purchaser(s). When such disclosures are required, NCR Voyix will seek appropriate protections of your Personal Data.

‍

**Disclosures to Protect Us or Others**. In certain circumstances, NCR Voyix may use or release Personal Data to third parties when disclosure is required or permitted by law (e.g. statute, judicial proceeding, court order, or subpoena). We also reserve our right to use or provide your Personal Data to third parties, including law enforcement, auditors, consultants, and government officials, to protect NCR Voyix's rights, property, or safety, and/or the rights or property of our customers, business partners, suppliers, or other third parties.

‍

##### Your Individual Rights

‍

In accordance with applicable law, we provide several mechanisms to allow you to:

* **Access Personal Data** about you consistent with legal requirements. In addition, you may have the right in some cases to receive or have your electronic Personal Data transferred to another party. Where permitted by law, NCR Voyix may charge a reasonable fee if we are required to provide information about you. You may have the right to request information about public and private entities with which the NCR Voyix has shared data.

* provide self-service tools that enable you to update Personal Data about you or refer you to the Controller of your Personal Data who is able to make the correction.

* **Request restriction of or object to Processing of your Personal Data**, including the right to opt in or opt out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Data to third parties, if applicable, where such requests are permitted by law. You may request restriction of the Processing of your Personal Data while NCR Voyix undertakes to verify the accuracy of your data where you have contested its accuracy; where NCR Voyix's Processing is unlawful and you have the right to erasure, but request that we restrict Processing instead; where the data are no longer needed for the purposes of the Processing by us, but they may be required by you for the pursuit or defense of a legal claim, or by NCR Voyix where its legitimate interests override your request for restriction.. NCR Voyix will notify you before we begin to Process any information about you that was restricted just prior to Processing.

You may log into your account or use the contact mechanisms specified below to make your request. We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws. Where necessary to protect your privacy, NCR Voyix may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before acting on a request.

‍

##### Consent Exceptions

‍

Where you have previously provided your consent, you may withdrawal your consent at any time; however, doing so will not affect the lawfulness of NCR Voyix's processing before your withdrawal of consent. Once you withdraw consent, we will no longer Process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for further Processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms or if Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

‍

##### Denying a Request

‍

In certain circumstances applicable law may permit NCR Voyix to deny such requests, for example, where an access request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular where it is repetitive, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of other persons would be violated. You may appeal a denial by contacting NCR Voyix in the manner set forth in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy.

‍

##### Use of Automated Individual Decision Making Including Statistical Analysis and Profiling

‍
