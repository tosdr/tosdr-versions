As used in this Section, if you purchase merchandise including hardware, then the term “Atari” means Atari VCS LLC or an affiliate of Atari VCS LLC.  

Your order through AtariVCS.com is an offer to Atari to agree on the delivery of the ordered merchandise including clothing and hardware (the “Product(s)”) in exchange for the listed price.

When you place an order on AtariVCS.com, we will send you a message confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the “Order Confirmation”). The Order Confirmation is acknowledgement that we have received your order but does not confirm acceptance of your offer to enter into an agreement.

In the case of hardware, we only accept your offer, and conclude the transaction for an item ordered by you, when we ship the hardware to you and send an e-mail confirming to you that we've shipped the product to you (the "Dispatch Confirmation"). If your order is shipped in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation for each package, and each Dispatch Confirmation and corresponding shipment will conclude a separate contract of sale between us for the hardware specified in that Dispatch Confirmation. Any hardware delivered to you remains property of Atari until payment has been fully made.

You consent to receiving sales invoices electronically.

Payment processing related to merchandise and/or Hardware purchased on AtariVCS.com may be performed by either Atari directly or by a third-party payment processor depending on the type of payment method used.

THE DIGITAL COLLECTIBLES ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. ANY TRANSFER OF CONTROL THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON THE APPLICABLE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK.

The Digital Collectibles are currently available only on the Ethereum Blockchain. You will not be able to transfer your Digital Collectibles to any digital wallet that is not compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain. In the event that you inadvertently transfer a Digital Collectible to a digital wallet that is not compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain, your Digital Collectible may be lost or destroyed.

The Digital Collectibles are transferable blockchain-based non-fungible tokens that evidence a limited license to Related Content, and, in some cases, a limited license to Third-Party Content and/or to access Additional Benefits, that is exclusive to the owner and thereby collectible as a form of alienable digital property. Like physical collectibles, the price of non-fungible tokens may be subject to fluctuation based upon broader industry trends and sentiment. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of non-fungible tokens. Unlike cryptocurrencies and other fungible digital assets, non-fungible tokens are not used to make payments. Non-fungible tokens are not mutually interchangeable and cannot be divided into smaller parts. These design features limit the usefulness of non-fungible tokens as a form of payment or substitute for currency. Instead, non-fungible tokens are enjoyed as digital collectibles.

There is no guaranteed future value for Digital Collectibles. Any future value of a Digital Collectible is based solely on consumer interest and demand for that Digital Collectible and not something that  or any Third Party Developer or other third party can control or will attempt to control or influence. We are not responsible for sustained losses due to vulnerability or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software (e.g., wallet, smart contract), the applicable blockchain or other third party service or infrastructure, including Supported Wallets and Supported Wallet Providers, or any other features of Digital Collectibles. We are not responsible for sustained losses due to late reports by developers or representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with the applicable blockchain supporting Digital Collectibles including forks, technical node issues or any other issues having fund losses as a result.

In some cases,  may integrate directly with third parties, including but not limited to, online merchant platforms, mailing list platforms, and social media platforms (“Third Party APIs”).  has no control over the uptime and functionality made available through Third Party APIs and as such certain aspects of the Platform could incur an outage outside of ’s control, and certain aspects of the Platform’s functionality could be impacted by changes of features made available through Third Party APIs.

The  platform is subject to flaws and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Platform.  may experience cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions to or delays on the Platform. You accept the risk of the Platform failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks, and you agree not to hold us accountable for any related losses.

**Indemnification**  
This section only applies to the extent permitted by applicable law. If you are prohibited by law from entering into the indemnification obligation below, then you assume, to the extent permitted by law, all liability for all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs and expert witnesses’ fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation below.   
  
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Atari, its affiliates, and licensors, and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, and suppliers from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from your User Contributtions or access to or use of our Services (including, without limitation, Digital Collectibles, Additional Benefits and Related Content) or violation of these Terms.  
   
**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**  
Any dispute or claim by you arising out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by New York law, exclusive of its choice of law rules. For any disputes deemed not subject to binding individual arbitration, as provided in the section immediately below, you and Atari agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court of New York City, New York, or, if federal court jurisdiction exists, the United States District Court for the state of New York. You and Atari agree to waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts (without affecting either party’s rights to remove a case to federal court if permissible), as well as any right to a jury trial. The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to these Terms. This paragraph will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.   
  
**Binding Individual Arbitration; No Class Actions**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

Most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting Atari customer support at [support@Atari.com](mailto:support@Atari.com). But we understand that sometimes disputes can’t be easily resolved by customer support. This Section explains how You and Atari agree to resolve those disputes, including (where applicable) by binding, individual arbitration. 

Arbitration is an alternative dispute-resolution procedure that allows us to resolve issues without the formality of going to court. Any dispute between You and Atari is submitted to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) for fair and fast resolution. Arbitration is more efficient for both you and Atari. 

**Disputes related to Atari’s End User License Agreement (“EULA”):** If you have agreed to Atari’s End User License Agreement (“EULA”), “Disputes” as that term is defined in the EULA will be resolved as provided for in the EULA, including the EULA’s “Binding Individual Arbitration” section. The dispute resolution terms below apply to disputes arising solely under these Terms and not to products or services governed by a EULA.

**Disputes related to these Terms:** If you have an issue related to these Terms and have not agreed to Atari’s EULA, the dispute-resolution terms below apply. 

**1\. Informal Resolution**

If you have an issue that our customer support can’t resolve, prior to starting arbitration You and Atari agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally to help get us to a resolution and control costs for both parties. You and Atari agree to make a good-faith effort to negotiate any dispute between us for at least 30 days (“Informal Resolution”). Those informal negotiations will start on the day You or Atari receive a written Notice of a Dispute in accordance with these Terms.

You will send your Notice of Dispute to Atari Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: NOTICE OF DISPUTE, 286 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017, U.S.A. Include your name, any relevant account name you use, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want Atari to do. If Atari has a dispute with You, Atari will send our Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.

If the dispute isn’t resolved within by Informal Resolution or small-claims court (below), You or Atari may start an arbitration in accordance with these Terms. 

**2\. Small Claims Court**

Instead of using Informal Resolution, You and Atari agree that You may sue us in small claims court in New York City, New York (if you meet the requirements of small claims court). We hope you’ll try Informal Resolution first, but you don’t have to before going to small-claims court.

**3\. Binding Individual Arbitration**

THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IN THIS SECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.

You and Atari agree that Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by the [Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc](https://www.jamsadr.com/). (“JAMS”) subject to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the [JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) and Procedures effective June 1, 2021 (the “JAMS Rules”) as modified by these Terms.

This means that You and Atari agree to a dispute-resolution process where we submit any Dispute to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) that makes the final decision to resolve the Dispute. JAMS uses experienced professionals to arbitrate disputes, which helps You and Atari resolve any disputes fairly, but more quickly and efficiently than going to court. The arbitrator may award the same remedies to you individually as a court could, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.

The arbitrator’s decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, and can be enforced like any other court order or judgment. 

If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

**3.1 Disputes We Agree to Arbitrate:**   
You and Atari agree to submit all Disputes between You and Atari to individual binding arbitration. “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between You and Atari that relates to your use or attempted use of Atari’s products or services and Atari’s products and services generally, including without limitation the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Binding Individual Arbitration section. 

You and Atari agree to arbitrate all Disputes regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory. 

The Informal Resolution and Arbitration sections do not apply to (1) individual actions in small claims court; (2) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows; (3) a complaint or remedy under the EU General Data Protection Regulation; (4) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision; (5) Atari’s right to seek injunctive relief against You in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds; (6) claims of piracy, creation, distribution, or promotion of cheats, and intellectual property infringement, and (7) the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below.  You and Atari agree that whether a dispute is subject to arbitration under these Terms will be determined by the arbitrator rather than a court.

**3.2 Arbitration Procedure:**   
To start an arbitration, review the JAMS Rules and follow the instructions for initiating an arbitration on the [JAMS](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration) website. The party starting an arbitration must send JAMS a “Demand for Arbitration” (available on its website), pay a filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party. You will send a copy to Atari Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE, 286 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017, U.S.A. Atari will send our copy to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us. 

The arbitration will be conducted by a single JAMS arbitrator selected with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. You and Atari both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.

If an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place in New York City, NY.

The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless You and Atari agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions. 

The arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by You or Atari to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence). The arbitrator may not award relief against Atari respecting any person other than You.

Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement.

**3.3 Arbitration Fees and Location:**   
If You start the arbitration, you must pay the JAMS filing fee required for consumer arbitrations. 

If the arbitrator finds You brought an arbitration claim against Atari for an improper purpose, frivolously, or without a sufficient pre-claim investigation into the facts or applicable law, then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS rules. 

JAMS costs do not include your Attorneys’ fees and costs and Attorneys’ fees and JAMS costs are not counted when determining how much a dispute involves. 

If you choose to be represented by an attorney, you will pay your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the applicable law provides otherwise. 

**3.4 Notice and Filing.** If a Dispute must be arbitrated, You or Atari must start arbitration of the Dispute within two (2) years from the date the Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period. Atari encourages You to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it. **The failure to provide timely notice shall bar all claims.**

**3.5 Continuation in Effect.** This Binding Individual Arbitration section survives any termination of these Terms or Atari’s provision of services to You.

**3.6 Future Terms Changes.** Although Atari may revise these Terms in its discretion, Atari does not have the right to alter these Terms to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute once that Dispute arises.

1. **Class Action Waiver.**   
    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You and Atari agree to only bring Disputes in an individual capacity and shall not:  
    seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions); or  
    consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of all parties to these Terms and all other actions or arbitrations. 
2. **Severability**.   
    If all or any provision of this Binding Individual Arbitration agreement is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then You and Atari agree that the provision will be severed and the rest of these Terms shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included. The sole exception is that if the Class Action Waiver is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, You and Atari agree that it will not be severable; this entire Binding Individual Arbitration section will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of clauses specified in these Terms. Under no circumstances shall arbitration be conducted on a class basis without Atari’s express consent.

**Language**  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the controlling language for these Terms is English. It is the express wish of the parties that these Terms and all related documents have been drawn up in English. Les parties déclarent qu'elles ont demandé et par les présentes confirment leur desir exprés que cette convention soit rédigee en anglais. Any translation has been provided for your convenience.  
   
**Waiver and Severability**  
No waiver of these Terms by Atari shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of Atari to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  
  
If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.  
   
**Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement**
