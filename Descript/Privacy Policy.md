Collection of Information
-------------------------

_Information You Provide to Us._ We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you create an account with Descript, fill out a form, create a project, upload content, request support, send us an email, or otherwise communicate or interact with us. The types of information we collect may include your name, email address, postal address, password, content like video, voice, or audio recordings and images, and other information you choose to provide. Additionally, if you subscribe to Descript, we collect details about your subscription like the type, duration, cost, and start date of your subscription, and we work with a third-party payment processor to collect and process your payment information.

_Information We Collect Automatically._ When you access or use the Descript Service, we may automatically collect information about you, including:

* _Log Information:_ We log information about your use of the Descript Service, including how you use theApp, the type of browser you use, browser language, access times, pages viewed, duration of time for which you viewed a page, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to the Descript Service;
* _Device Information:_ We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access the Descript Service, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information; and
* _Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:_ We (and those who perform work for us) use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that helps us to better understand how the Descript Service is used and improve the Descript Service and your experience. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in the Descript Service or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see [Your Choices](#your-choices) section below.

_Information We Collect from Other Sources_

We obtain information from other sources. For example, we may collect information from social networks, advertising networks, internet service providers, and data analytics providers. This information includes handles, content, and other information shared with us through third-party features that you use on the Descript Service or posted on social media pages (such as our social media page or other pages accessible to us). Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a third-party platform (such as Google), we will have access to certain information from that platform, such as your name, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that platform.

_Information We Derive_

We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your location based on your IP address.

Use of Information
------------------

We may use information we collect from you for various purposes, including to:

* Provide, maintain, analyze, test, and improve the Descript Service and our technology;
* Generate voiceprints, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions, and use those voiceprints to authenticate you and prevent fraud as described [below](#below);
* Process transactions and send you related information, including confirmations and invoices;
* Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;
* Respond to your comments, questions, and requests and provide customer service;
* Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards, and events offered by us and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you (see the [Your Choices](#your-choices) section below for information about how to opt-out of these communications at any time);
* Monitor and analyze trends, usage, performance, and activities in connection with the Descript Service;
* Target advertisements to you on third-party properties as described [below](#below);
* Detect, investigate and prevent security incidents, fraudulent transactions, and other illegal activities and protect the rights and property of us and others;
* Personalize and improve the Descript Service and for research and development purposes including training our artificial intelligence models;
* Comply with our legal and financial obligations;
* Create de-identified, anonymized, or aggregated information that we will not attempt to re-identify; and
* Carry out the purposes for which the information was specifically collected or for which you provided consent.

_Note with Respect to the Use of Project Information:_ Notwithstanding the foregoing, we protect the information contained in the Projects you create using the Descript Service (the “Projects’) as confidential information, and limit our use thereof, in accordance with the confidentiality obligations set forth in our Terms of Service. The Descript Service automatically processes your Projects, but it does not involve human access to your Projects unless: 1) you provide your consent; 2) we are required to do so by law. We may also use your Projects to analyze and improve the Descript Service. You can opt out of having your Projects used to improve the Descript Service by emailing us at [support@descript.com](mailto:support@descript.com).

_Note with Respect to AI Speakers:_ When you use AI Speakers, we record your voice and use it to create a voice model for the purpose of providing the Descript Service. We may also use and store other training data associated with AI Speakers as part of our research datasets to analyze, maintain, and improve our technology, including our voice technology, and for other research and development and data analysis purposes. However, before doing so, we disassociate the data from your account. In addition, we may have our employees and contractors listen to audio samples of your original and your AI Speakers recordings to test their quality and Descript employees may use your AI Voice to create a series of non-defamatory utterances, solely for internal, quality assurance purposes. Other than as described above, only you, and people you explicitly share access with, will have access to your audio recordings. We will not disclose your audio recordings to third parties except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy.

When you use AI Speakers, we generate voice prints from your consent statement and the audio recording you are editing to authenticate you and prevent fraud. We will retain those voiceprints until the purpose of collection has been satisfied or for up to three years after you last accessed your account, whichever occurs first. The Descript software that generates voiceprints runs on web hosting infrastructure provided by one of our vendors. Descript does not otherwise disclose voiceprints to third parties.

_Note with Respect to Google API Services:_ We use YouTube's API Services in connection with the Descript Service to provide certain features. Such use is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy located at [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) and the YouTube Terms of Service located at [https://www.youtube.com/t/terms](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms). In addition to our normal procedures for managing and deleting stored data, you can manage and revoke access to your YouTube API data via the Google security settings page at [https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions). We also use Google's Workspace API to provide certain features of the Descript Service. Please note, however, that we will not use any data obtained through our integration with Google Workspace to develop, improve, or train our AI models.

_Note with Respect to Advertising and Analytics:_ We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and in applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Descript Service, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Descript Service and other websites and better understand your online activity. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit [https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) or visit if you are a resident of the EEA. Your device may also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.

Disclosure of Information

* We may disclose personal information to legal authorities and others if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation or if we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, if we believe that you have violated the law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of us or others;
* We disclose personal information to third parties who assist us with marketing;
* We may disclose personal information to our lawyers and other professional advisors where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and manage our business interests;
