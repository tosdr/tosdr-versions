These partners may use this data to enrich their databases, improve their services, and enhance our marketing strategies. We ensure that any data sharing is conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") has made available for consumers tools on which you can register your choices not to be tracked by participating advertising networks or companies in the collection and use of your online activities. These are (1) The DAA Consumer Choice Page for Mobile Web (at [https://www.aboutads.info/choices](https://www.aboutads.info/choices)) and (2) DAA AppChoices (at [https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices)), which is a mobile app that allows you to opt-out of the collection and use of cross-app data, other than for permitted purposes, by listed third-party AppChoices participants.

You can also prevent your receipt of interest-based ads on websites by deleting and declining cookies in your browser(s). Note that your opt-out choice is applied only to the browser from which you make the choice.

Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications, or your mobile web browser may provide a "Do Not Track" browser setting which will notify those ad servers and networks who recognize the signals to refrain from sending you interest-based ads to your mobile device. You can check the settings on your device for such options in your device's operating system. Alternatively, you may wish to download the TrustE mobile application and/or the Digital Alliance "App Choices" mobile application and follow the instructions provided.

International Data Transfers: Your personal information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.

Specifically, our website servers are located in the USA, and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. We use Standard Contractual Clauses and adhere to the adequacy decisions by the European Commission to ensure a high level of protection for your data during international transfers.

We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners, and further details can be provided upon request.
