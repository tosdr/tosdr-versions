Dave’s Redistricting Terms of Use



Updated: November 26, 2023



Thank you for your interest in Dave’s Redistricting, a project of Social Good Fund (a 501(c)(3) California

non-profit corporation). These “Terms of Use” govern your use of the Website, and you will be required

to agree to them before using the Website. Accordingly, Social Good Fund (referred to in these Terms of

Use as “we” or “us” or “SGF”) and you are entering into a binding, legal contract. So please take a moment

to understand your obligations (and rights!) provided under these Terms of Use.



When we refer to the “Website” that means, collectively, the Dave’s Redistricting domains, subdomains,

at DavesRedistricting.org.



When we use the term “Service” or “Services,” we mean any functionality from our Website, applications

or software, including without limitation access to our account management platform, and any related or

ancillary services or products, including any data.



1. Summary of Important Terms

a. Entire Agreement: These Terms of Use, which include our Privacy Policy, make up the entire

agreement between you and SGF.

b. Age Restrictions: Our services are offered and available only to users who are of legal age to

consent and be bound by contract in their jurisdiction. The Website is not meant for minors. For

more information see Section 9 and Section 21.7, which is part of our Privacy Policy.

c. Limitation on Liability: The Website is simply a platform offering useful information about voting

tabulation districts, which is the term used by the Census Bureau for precincts, wards, parishes and

similar terms (generically precincts); users can also access census blocks which are subdivisions of

precincts. This information includes demographics and information about past elections. The

Website can be used to create your own district maps, for Congressional districts, state legislative

districts, city or county districts, and districts for other elected offices. Because you are making

your own use of these, in Section 11 you agree that our liability is limited, and you release SGF

from, and waive your right to recover, all damages.

d. Dispute Resolution: Section 15 explains that you agree to arbitrate any claims you have instead of

going to court and that you will not bring class-action claims against SGF. That section also

explains how to opt-out of those terms.



2. Website Accounts



The Website offers a way of accessing precinct and census block information and allows you to manipulate

precincts and census blocks to create possible district maps that are different from district maps that may

have been adopted by states or other jurisdictions. To access our services, you will be asked to provide

2



certain registration details or other information to create a Dave's Redistricting account. It is a condition of

your use that all the information you provide us is true, correct, current, and complete. Any information

you provide us will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy.



To set up an account to use our Website, you will provide us your email address and a password, and

possibly, a username. When you publish a map, our default is that your email address, without the domain

name, is used as your username. We do offer an option that will allow you to create a username that is

displayed with any of your published maps. You also acknowledge that your account is personal to you

and agree not to provide any other person with access to your username, password, or other security

information. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your username or

password or any other breach of security. You should use particular caution when accessing your account

from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other

personal information.



We have the right to disable any username, password or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided

by us, at any time if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Use.



3. License to Use services and Prohibited Uses

13. Indemnification



To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold SGF and its affiliates,

officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, successors, and assigns harmless from and

against any and all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or

investigation and defense of Claims and Losses. Further, you hereby authorize and grant SGF the right to

negotiate, settle, pay, compromise, and otherwise assume full control for defense over any Claims and

14. Governing Law and Territorial Issues



All matters relating to the services, the Website, and these Terms of Use and any dispute or claim arising

therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed

by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any

choice or conflict of law provision or rule.

You warrant that your access and use of the Website and services is permissible under all applicable local

laws, rules, regulations, and restrictions. SGF may, at our sole discretion, limit availability of the Website

or service based on geography or jurisdiction.



15. Dispute Resolution; Waiver of Class Actions; and Opt-Out Procedures



All claims or disputes relating to these Terms of Use or our services or Website, must be resolved through

final and binding arbitration, except for certain injunctive relief (further explained below). Before filing

any claim, however, SGF seeks to resolve all disputes informally. We truly believe that reasonable people

can find resolution quickly and efficiently, and so before a formal arbitration proceeding, you must first

contact SGF explaining your claim. If the dispute is not informally resolved within 30 days of your notice,

then a formal arbitration proceeding may be brought under this section.



The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer arbitration under the AAA’s set of rules

selected by the arbitrator. The arbitration will be in English, and will be held in Seattle, Washington. Instead

of appearing in person, you and SGF may appear via conference call or webcam, or any other means where

all the participants can hear and respond to one another in real-time.



As an exception to formal arbitration, a lawsuit may be filed in the state or federal courts in Contra Costa

County, California for immediate injunctive relief to stop or prevent further abuse or infringement of

intellectual property rights (trademarks, copyrights, patent, trade secrets, domain name rights, or the like).

8



NO CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUITS. You and SGF agree that any disputes

arising out of these Terms of Use or the Website or services shall be submitted individually, and shall not

be subject to any class action or representative status. Accordingly, both SGF and you waive your right to

join claims with others or participate as a member of a class of claims submitted to arbitration. The

foregoing class action waiver is essential and material to these Terms of Use, especially with the consent

to submit to binding arbitration. If any portion of the waiver for class action claims because nullified,

limited, or otherwise cancelled then the agreement to arbitrate hereunder shall also become void.



YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THE ABOVE, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A

RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH THE COURT, AND POTENTIALLY HAVE A JUDGE OR

JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO JOIN A CLASS

OR HAVE CLAIMS DECIDED THROUGH REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. BY AGREEING TO

THESE TERMS YOU HAVE WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.



To opt-out of the foregoing arbitration provisions and waiver of class action or representative claims, please

email SGF according to the notice provisions below, no later than 30 days from agreeing to these Terms of

Use.



16. Waiver and Severability



No waiver by SGF of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or

continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure by

SGF to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or

provision for that instance or future instances of breach.



If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be

invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be modified and interpreted to the

greatest extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and such that the remaining provisions of the

Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.



17. Notice to SGF and Your Comments or Concerns



For valid notice to SGF, including general comments, concerns, or Feedback, please send an email, to:

feedback@davesredistricting.org

We will send notices to you at your Website account email address. Please keep that email address up to

manner and by the means set forth therein.
