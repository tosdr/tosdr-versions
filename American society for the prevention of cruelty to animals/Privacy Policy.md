Some of this information may be collected by external parties on our behalf. For example, we use a payment processor when you may conduct a transaction through the Services. The ASPCA does not itself collect or store payment card information.

**b.**      **Information The ASPCA Learns From Your Use of the Services.** When you interact with our Services, certain information about you is automatically collected via cookies and similar technologies (referred to collectively herein as "cookies"). Cookies are small text files that are stored within your device's memory by a website. Cookies enable a website such as ours to keep track of your activities to improve user experience, advertise our Services, and ensure the security of our Services. As you use our Services, the following information is automatically collected from you:

* _Usage details_ about your interaction with our Services, such as which pages you access, frequency of access, what you click on, search terms, date and length of visits, and referring website addresses.
* _Device information_, including the IP address and other details of a device that you use to connect with our Services, such as device type and unique device identifier, hardware model, operating system, browser, mobile network information, mobile carrier, and the device's telephone number.
* _Location information_ where you choose to provide us with access to information about your device’s location.

Much of this information is collected through cookies, which may be operated by our partners who assist us in collecting information about usage of the Services, targeted advertising, or providing other services to you. While we do not share your information for monetary value with these partners, the engagement of these partners may be considered a “sale” of your information.

For example, we use Google Analytics to conduct analytics and collect usage details. You can learn more about Google Analytics [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html), and opt out of collection of your information by using the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). We also use Google Ads and Facebook Pixel to customize our advertising and to serve you ads based on your browsing behavior. These partners use cookies to serve you ads based on your prior visits to our Services and other websites on the internet. These cookies allow your behavior to be tracked after you have been redirected to our Services by clicking on an ad. You can learn more about Google Ads [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and Facebook [here](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?entry_point=data_policy_redirect&entry=0). You can opt-out of personalized advertising through Google's [Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous?hl=en) and Facebook's [Ad Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads). You can also clear and control the information third parties share with Facebook in your [Off-Facebook Activity](https://www.facebook.com/off_facebook_activity/) page.

These partners may be able to identify your email address via cookies and combine it with other information they have access to, such as your mailing address, so we can send you information we feel may be of interest to you.

Please note we use other cookies set by other third-party partners for the above-described purposes. You may be able to opt out of tracking by cookies or control how information collected by cookies is being used via a number of means, as described in [General Privacy Choices](https://www.aspca.org/about-us/privacy-policy#generalprivacy).

The ASPCA may also use and share in an aggregate or de-identified manner information at our discretion, including for research, analysis, marketing, and improvement of the Services.

**3.      HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION**

The ASPCA may share information as follows:

* _With service providers_ that we believe need the information to perform a technology, business, or other professional function for us such as payment processing, IT services, maintenance and hosting of our Services, marketing, accounting, auditing, tax services, and other professional services.
* _With advertising and measurement partners_ who assist us in serving advertisements regarding the Services to others who may be interested in the Services, or who use cookies to display interest-based advertising to you on the Services. These third parties use tracking technologies on the Services to collect or receive information from the Services and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. Third parties may allow other companies to access information about you so that they may market other products you may be interested in.
* _With third parties whose products, services, or offerings may be of interest to you_. The ASPCA may share, rent, or sell your email or mailing address with third parties that we believe engage in activities that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of this sharing by following the instructions in [Donor Privacy Choices](https://www.aspca.org/about-us/privacy-policy#donorprivacy) or by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.aspca.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). No mobile information will be shared with third parties, including affiliates, for marketing or promotional purposes. This sharing excludes text messaging originator opt-in data and consent, and this information will not be shared with any third parties.
* _When required by law_ and when we are legally required to do so, such as in response to or in compliance with court or regulatory agency orders, legal proceedings, or legal process, to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims or demands, or to comply with the requirements of any applicable law.
* _To prevent harm_ or if we believe it is necessary in order to detect, investigate, prevent, or take action against illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or personal safety of any person.
* _As part of a business transaction_ with another entity or its affiliates or service providers in connection with a contemplated or actual merger, acquisition, consolidation, change of control, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, or if we undergo bankruptcy or liquidation. We cannot promise that an acquiring party or the merged entity will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Notice.

**4.      HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE INFORMATION**

We use a combination of physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the information we collect through the Services. In particular, our Services have industry standard encryption measures in place to protect personal information and all payment information is transmitted using Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology. While we use these precautions to safeguard your information, we cannot guarantee the security of the networks, systems, servers, devices, and databases we operate or that are operated on our behalf. If you use our Services outside of the United States, you understand that we may collect, process, and store your personal information in the United States and other countries.
