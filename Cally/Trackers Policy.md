cally.com's privacy and cookie statement
========================================

_This privacy and cookie statement was last amended on June 14, 2023._

Kompas Meet B.V. (hereinafter called cally.com) provides a tool that enables family, friends or business contacts to schedule appointments with each other. Your privacy is of great importance to cally.com. Hence our adherence to the General Data Processing Regulation (GDPR). This privacy and cookie statement explains which personal data we process via the website and application of cally.com.

Our privacy and cookie statement in brief
-----------------------------------------

In processing personal data, we comply with privacy legislation. This means that we:

* **Lay down our purposes clearly** in this privacy and cookie statement before processing your personal data.
* **Store as few personal data as possible** and only store those data that are required for our purposes.
* **Ask explicit permission** for the processing of your personal data, if permission is required.
* **Take the required security measures** to protect your personal data. These obligations are also imposed on parties that process personal data on our behalf.
* **Respect your rights,** such as the right to inspection, rectification or deletion of your personal data that we have processed.

For which purposes do we use your personal data?
------------------------------------------------

We obtain various personal data from you. For each purpose, we will indicate which data we obtain from you, for what purpose we process them and for how long they will be retained. If you have any questions, or would like to know exactly which of your data are stored by us, please contact cally.com. The contact details are at the bottom of this privacy and cookie statement.

Contact
-------

When you complete the contact form, consult our help desk, send an email, contact us by telephone, or otherwise contact us, you are responding to our offer to contact us (performance of the contract).

To that end, we will process the following personal data:

* Name
* Email address
* Telephone number
* Any information you enter yourself as the content of a message (your question)
* Any attachments that you add yourself

We keep this information for as long as it is required for this contact or for a maximum period of six months after we last contacted you.

Create or fill in a date picker
-------------------------------

If you wish to create a date picker without an account, or are invited to fill in a date picker, you are accepting our offer to enter into an agreement with us.

To that end, we will process the following personal data:

* Name
* Email address
* IP address
* Geolocation
* Names of participants
* Email addresses of participants
* Content of the appointment

We will keep this information for a period of 30 days following the appointment.

Creating an account
-------------------

You can create your own account on our website. This also allows you to log on to our application. You can choose to open a basic (free) account, a plus account or an enterprise account (performance of the agreement).

To that end, we will process the following personal data:

* Name
* Email address
* Password
* IP address
* Interests and other profile details
* Payment details (only for the plus and enterprise accounts)

We will keep this information for two years after you close your account or for two years after you last used your basic account. We keep some data for a longer period on account of the obligation to retain records for tax purposes for seven years.

Managing accounts
-----------------

You can also add other people's contact details in your own account. This enables you to send out invitations quickly and efficiently (performance of the agreement).

To that end, we will process the following personal data:

* The names of contacts
* Contacts' email addresses

We will keep this information for two years after you close your account or for two years after you last used your basic account.

Application
-----------

We provide a digital environment where you can find everything about the above-mentioned topics. We use your email address and a self-selected password (log-in details) for the account. We need this data in order to be able to offer the account environment you request (agreement) and to provide you with our services. We will keep this information for the duration of your account and until we cease providing you with services. You can close your account in your account settings, or by contacting us through our support system.

Download our application
------------------------

You can download our applications from the App Store or from Google Play. We have no influence on which personal data the provider ([Apple](https://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/) or [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)) processes and for which purpose. We therefore advise you to read the relevant privacy and cookie statements of the relevant provider.

Becoming a friend
-----------------

Have we earned a place in your heart? If so, you can also become a donor (performance of the agreement).

To that end, we will process the following data belonging to you:

* Name
* Email address
* Address details
* Payment details

You can choose to share your data anonymously; this means your data will not be displayed in the Friends of Datumprikker list. We will keep this information for 2 years after you unsubscribe as a Friend. We retain some personal data for a longer period on account of the obligation to retain records for tax purposes.

Profiling
---------

The appointments you make, your location and visits to our website show us what you are interested in. This will enable us to create a profile of you and display specific advertisements. We do so on the basis of our legitimate interest. After all, we want to show you the range of fun events you can pick. These customer profiles are spread across a number of categories so we can analyse your interests and further personalise the products we offer to you, including by way of personalised advertisements. For more information about the way this is done and the retention periods, see the cookie table below. You can always object to this by contacting us using the contact details at the bottom of this page.

Advertisements
--------------

Besides our own advertisement, we can also display advertisements from third-parties. You can manage your preference in the [consent form](#).

Working at cally.com
--------------------

Have you responded to one of our vacancies or have you submitted an unsolicited job application? If so, we will process your personal data in order to be able to process your application and to prepare an employment contract, should one be concluded.

To that end, we will process the following personal data:

* Name and address details
* Email address
* Telephone number
* Curriculum Vitae
* Motivation letter
* Any other information that you enclose with your application.

We will retain your application details for a maximum of six weeks after the position has been filled. We will retain the data so that we will still be able to contact you should the position become vacant again within the trial period. If we are unable to offer you a position at this time, we can – with your consent – retain the application details for another year. You can withdraw your consent at any time by sending us an email. If you come to work with us, we will keep your application details in the personnel file. This file will be kept for as long as is necessary, and the application details will be retained for a maximum of two years after commencement of the employment.

A social media and internet search may form part of the application procedure. This is required to ensure that our image is preserved when we take on new staff, and we do this based on a legitimate interest. For this purpose, we will Google your name and look at any profiles you may have on the various social media. It goes without saying that we will only do so insofar as these profiles are public; we will not ask you to grant us access to a protected social media page or make a connection with us. The results of the searches will be discussed with you. If you object to this, you can indicate this by email at the time of your application.

Sharing personal data with third parties
----------------------------------------

cally.com will share your personal data with third parties only where this is permitted under the current legislation. We may provide your personal data to third parties because:

* we have engaged them to process certain data;
* this is required in performing the agreement with you;
* you have provided permission to do so;
* we have a legitimate interest in doing so;
* we are legally obliged to do so (for example, if the police so demand in case of a suspicion of a crime).

The parties that process personal data on our or your instruction include:

* IT suppliers and providers
* cookie service providers
* payment service providers
* marketing companies
* advertisement agencies
* recruitment agencies (during a job application)

In order to provide you with our services, we may provide your personal data to parties located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). cally.com will do so only if the personal data are processed with an appropriate level of protection.

Social media buttons
--------------------

On our website, we use social media buttons, which bring you to the social media platforms. This gives you the option of following us and sharing content within the network. In addition, you will see advertisements on your social media page. The buttons work through pieces of code originating from social media networks. If you want to know what the social media platforms do with your personal data, please read the relevant privacy statement:

* [Facebook (privacy statement)](https://en-gb.facebook.com/privacy/explanation)
* [Twitter (privacy statement)](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/update-privacy-policy)
* [Instagram (privacy statement)](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875)
* [LinkedIn (privacy statement)](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?_l=en_GB)

These social media companies are based in the United States and are members of the US Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield programme. We are aware that the Privacy Shield [was declared invalid on 16 July 2020](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-07/cp200091en.pdf) by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The practical effects of this remain to be seen. We are currently investigating the impact this will have on our organisation and the options available to us. As soon as the situation is clearer, we will adjust our procedure and privacy and cookie statement accordingly.
