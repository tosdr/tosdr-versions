Terms of Service
================

_**Last Revision: June 30, 2022**_

**Notice of Arbitration Agreement: These Terms of Service contain an Arbitration Agreement that may impact your rights to use the courts to resolve disputes. Please carefully review the terms of the Arbitration Agreement below. _If you do not wish to be bound by the Arbitration Agreement, do not use the Service as defined herein._**

**Notice of Class Action/Class Arbitration Waiver: These Terms of Service include a waiver of your right to proceed with class actions or class arbitrations. Please carefully review Section XV(g) for details. If you do not wish to waive rights to class-based relief, do not use the Service.**

This DomainTools Terms of Service Agreement (“Terms”) applies to (1) your use of DomainTools’ services, software, and websites, including the services located at domaintools.com and any other website owned or controlled by DomainTools (collectively, the “Service”); and (2) all material and data that you download, receive, or otherwise obtain through the use of the Service (“DomainTools Data”), including data provided to DomainTools by third parties (“Partner Data”).

Certain users of the DomainTools Service will separately be bound by the terms of an Enterprise Subscription Agreement (an “ESA”) entered into between DomainTools and an organization to which the user is associated and through which the organization is given certain rights to access the Services, and for those users that ESA will control to the extent of any conflict with these Terms.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to these Terms and any other referenced terms, conditions, and policies. You further acknowledge that by using the Service, you necessarily access computers, servers, networks, and other hardware owned and operated by DomainTools to provide the Service (collectively, the “System”). If you are accessing or using the Service on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf.

**Your authorization to access the System and use the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. If you cannot or do not accept these Terms, you are not authorized to access the System or use the Service and any access of the System or use of the Service by you is unauthorized.**

DomainTools reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms at any time. DomainTools will alert you of any changes by indicating at the top of these Terms the date they were last revised. It is your responsibility to check these Terms periodically for changes. Your use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms means you accept and agree to the changes.

**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.**

I. The Service
--------------

(a) **Requirements for Use of the Service.** In order to use the Service, you must be at least 18 years old and have legal capacity to enter binding contracts. Additionally, you must not be barred from accessing or using the Service under United States law or the laws applicable where you reside or from where you access or use the Service.

(b) **DomainTools Limited License to You.** Subject to your compliance with these Terms, including, without limitation the Restrictions on Use and Responsibilities in Section III below, DomainTools grants you a limited, revocable, non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and non-exclusive right and license to access and use the Service solely (i) for your own personal or internal business purposes, and (ii) in connection with cybersecurity; fraud prevention; network and information security; threat detection, prevention, and remediation; law, regulatory, and rights enforcement; and the investigation of illegal acts or threats to safety or security.

(c) **Membership Account Registration.** Certain features or services offered on or through the Service may require you to open a membership account. In order to open an account, you must provide DomainTools with certain information (“Registration Data”) requested on the registration form; inquiries marked “required” must be answered, and any other request for information may be left blank. You agree that the Registration Data you provide: (1) is true, accurate, current, and complete, and (2) will be maintained and updated by you to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. DomainTools reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of the Service and refuse to provide you with any and all current or future use of the Service if DomainTools, in its sole discretion, determines that any of your Registration Data is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete.

(d) **Account Security.** During the registration process you will provide an email address, which will function as your user name, and select a password, both of which you may be able to modify later subject to certain system and technical restrictions (“Account Credentials”). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account Credentials and are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account Credentials or that uses your account whether or not authorized by you. Your account will be charged for all activity authenticated with your Account Credentials even if you later determine the use was fraudulent or unauthorized by you. You will immediately notify DomainTools of any unauthorized use of your Account Credentials or any other breach of security. DomainTools cannot, and will not, be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this requirement.

(e) **Single User Accounts.** With the exception of certain paid membership types, DomainTools accounts may only be accessed and used by the registered user. Sharing, selling, or transferring your Account Credentials with another user is prohibited and a basis for immediate account termination or suspension.

(f) **Paid Memberships.** Certain features or services offered on or through the Service may require a paid membership. Available membership types and associated fees, terms, and conditions will be posted on a website associated with the Service. The term of a paid membership starts when payment is received and continues for the duration you selected during account registration (a “Membership Term”)—e.g. one month or one year. You agree that you will pay for the membership and any additional services or products you purchase through the Service, and that DomainTools may charge your credit card or payment account for any membership upgrades purchased and for any additional amounts (including any taxes, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your account. Information, including fees and pricing, may be inaccurately displayed on our Services due to system or typographical errors. While we make every attempt to avoid these errors, they may occur. We reserve the right to correct any and all errors when they do occur, and we do not honor inaccurate or erroneous prices. Our prices are also subject to change without notice.

(g) **Automatic Renewal; Subsequent Terms.** The Membership Term will automatically renew, unless terminated by you prior to the end of the Membership Term, for an additional period of the same duration, or at your election, another period then offered by DomainTools (an “Additional Term”). Similarly, any Additional Term will automatically renew unless terminated by you prior to the end of an Additional Term for another Additional Term, or at your election, another period then offered by DomainTools. If you do not elect an Additional Term of a different period than your current term, then you agree to pay for an Additional Term of the same duration as your current term based on the published pricing in effect at the time of renewal. If you elect an Additional Term for a different period, you agree to pay the fees disclosed by DomainTools in connection with that different period. You authorize DomainTools to charge the credit card, PayPal account or other authorized payment method on file for an amount equal to the fees for the Additional Term unless you have cancelled prior to the end of the current term.

To avoid renewal of a paid membership, you must cancel at least 48 hours prior to the end of your current Membership Term. You may cancel the paid membership by updating your membership account here [https://account.domaintools.com/my-account/change-account](https://account.domaintools.com/my-account/change-account/). If you cancel your paid membership, you may use your paid membership until the end of the then current Membership Term and your paid membership will not be renewed after the period expires. Generally, subject to any specific cancellation and refund rights you may have under law, you will not be eligible for a refund of any portion of the membership fees paid for the then current Membership Term. In situations where DomainTools provides a refund either in accordance with the terms applicable to the specific Service or otherwise, unless prohibited by law, DomainTools may terminate your paid membership access for the remainder of the corresponding Membership Term.

(h) **Membership Changes.** You may change your membership level by upgrading from one membership type to another. For example, you may upgrade from one type of paid membership to another type of paid membership. An upgrade will take effect immediately, and you will be charged a prorated fee based on the remaining length of the current Membership Term, if applicable. You may downgrade your membership level by renewing at a different membership type or electing to not renew prior to the end of your current Membership Term. A downgrade will take effect at the end of the current Membership Term.

(i) **Fees.** All fees and charges paid by you in relation to the Service are nonrefundable, except as required by law or as otherwise stated herein. DomainTools accepts American Express, Visa, MasterCard and PayPal and requires, for some membership types, that You have one such payment method on file with DomainTools before you may use the Service. All fees will be billed to the credit card or payment account you designate during the registration process. If DomainTools is unable to successfully charge your credit card or payment account for fees due or you are otherwise in breach or default under these Terms, DomainTools reserves the right to immediately terminate or suspend your access to the Service, including your access to any reports or information available through your account. In the event you change your credit card or payment information or cancel the credit card or payment account on file with DomainTools, you will (1) promptly advise DomainTools of the change or cancellation and provide updated credit card or payment account information that can be charged by DomainTools, and (2) pay any amount due to DomainTools for the Service.

(j) **Account Disputes and Unacceptability of Chargebacks.** If you have a question about charges made to your account, please contact DomainTools immediately. You may request that DomainTools refund charges to your charge, credit or debit cards. DomainTools will review such request and respond within 5 business days. However, you acknowledge and agree that chargebacks requested through your issuing bank are an unacceptable charge dispute resolution method. If you dispute the credit card charge that DomainTools charges for its services, DomainTools reserves the right to suspend your account as soon as DomainTools is informed of your chargeback request. You agree to immediately pay to DomainTools any chargebacks of amounts originally charged to your charge, credit or debit cards, as well as for fees incurred by DomainTools for such chargebacks.
