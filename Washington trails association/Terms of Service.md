Visitors have a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive right to access and use the Content of this website subject to these terms and conditions. The term "Content" means all information, text, images, data, links, software, or other material accessible through the website, whether created by WTA or provided by another person for display on the website.

The Content may contain typographical errors, other inadvertent errors, or inaccuracies. We reserve the right to make changes to document names and content, descriptions or specifications of products or services, or other information without obligation to issue any notice of such changes.

Nothing contained on this website should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use this website or any Content displayed on this website, through the use of framing or otherwise, except: (a) as expressly permitted by these Terms of Use; or (b) with our prior written permission or the permission of such third party that may own the trademark or copyright of material displayed on this website.

With respect to such forums, we act as a passive conduit for such distribution and are not responsible for Content. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information in Content expressed or made available by users of an online discussion forum or report posting forum are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of WTA. We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any such Content. You are responsible for ensuring that Content submitted to this website is not provided in violation of any copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights of another person or entity.

**13.  Exclusions**

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you.

**17.  Termination**

We may terminate any visitor's access to our website, including access to any online discussion forum or report posting forum, in our sole discretion, for any reason and at any time, with or without prior notice.

**18.  Enforcement**

These Terms of Service shall be governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of Washington, United States of America, notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law.

All disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service shall be finally resolved by arbitration conducted in the English language in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. under the mandatory arbitration rules of the King County Superior Court. The parties shall appoint as sole arbitrator a retired judge who presided in the State of Washington. Each party shall bear its own costs of arbitration (except that the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator). All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, security, or other equitable remedies from the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington or any other court of competent jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the arbitrator be authorized to award punitive damages, including but not limited to federal or state statutes permitting multiple or punitive damage awards. Any purported award of punitive or multiple damages shall be beyond the arbitrator's authority, void, and unenforceable.

**19.  Severability**

If any part of these Terms of Service is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

**20.  Entire Agreement**

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter herein. We may, at our sole discretion and without notice, revise these terms at any time by updating this posting.

**21.  For Additional Information**
