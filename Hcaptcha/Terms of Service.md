Master Terms of Service
=======================

_Last Updated: June 14, 2023. Please note that our English language terms are authoritative._

Welcome to hCaptcha! Thank you for being a part of our community. All users of the "Services" (defined below) must agree to the following terms (the "Terms of Service"). Under these Terms of Service, "IMI", "we" and "us" refers to Intuition Machines, Inc. and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, representatives, and agents, and our "website" includes any website under our control, including www.hcaptcha.com and www.imachines.com.

Please read these Terms of Service. They include, among other provisions, disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liability, and binding arbitration. Please note that these Terms of Service may have changed since your last visit to our website. We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion. In the event of a material change, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms of Service on this page, after which you must affirmatively accept the updated Terms of Service in order to continue using or accessing the Site or the Service.

Please note that your use of our Service is governed by our Data Processing Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference. Please review this agreement to see how we process personal data on your behalf. Note that we operate as a "data processor" for purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and a "service provider" for the purpose of the California Consumer Privacy Act.

[Data Processing Agreement (Last updated: April 21, 2023)](https://newassets.hcaptcha.com/dpa/IMI_Data_Processing_Addendum_4.20.2023.pdf)

If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you may not use or access the Site or the Service.

1\. Purpose

The Services include an online security service (the "hCaptcha Service") and a platform (the "Intuition Machines Platform") on which an individual ("Contributor") can choose to perform tasks that a third party entity or Intuition Machines itself (each a "Requester") posts to our website or the hCaptcha Service, either directly on our website or by accessing the Intuition Machines Platform and/or performing tasks through or in connection with a third party entity and/or platform or service (each, an "Integrator"). Requesters post tasks and invite Contributors to perform them in exchange for rewards provided by IMI to Integrators, or as determined by the Requester if the Requester is using the Intuition Machines Platform or hCaptcha Service to serve tasks to their own end-users. We charge companies and individuals (each a "Customer") for use of our platform so that they may use our software, author tasks, hire us to author tasks, and/or gain access to the Contributors. We also charge Integrators for use of our hCaptcha Service in order to reduce fraud, abuse, and spam on their websites, mobile apps, and other online properties. The foregoing is referred to collectively as the "Services."

2\. Eligibility

By using or registering for our Services, you agree: you are at least 18 years of age; you have the authority to enter this agreement on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent, and will at all times remain in compliance with these Terms of Service and all IMI policies and guidelines referenced herein; and you will not abuse our website, misrepresent your identity to us, or use artificial intelligence to complete any portion of any task on IMI which requires human intelligence.

3\. Customers and Requesters

If you are a Customer or Requester, you agree that the additional terms attached hereto as the Customer Appendix will apply and be incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. If you are not a Customer or Requester, or cease to be a Customer or Requester, then the additional terms in the Customer Appendix will not apply nor will they be incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.

4\. Username and Password

Upon registration, you will be asked to disclose certain personal information about you ("Personal Information"), including your name, email address, and to create a username and password, all of which will be subject to our Privacy Policy, available on our website. You alone are responsible for monitoring, ensuring and maintaining the security of your account, passwords, and any authentication keys associated with your account, and you are responsible for any use of or action taken through use of that information on the Services.

You agree that you will not share your account or password with anyone.

You must notify IMI immediately if you suspect that your account information has been stolen or used by someone else, or any other breach of security.

You agree to provide us with true, accurate and complete information as requested in our registration process. You also agree to update such information promptly as necessary to keep it current and accurate.

5\. Your Privacy, Your Data, and "Data For All"

You accept our Privacy Policy, which governs what we will do with any Personal Information you give to us.

In addition to Personal Information, you may also be required to provide (or it may be necessary for us to collect) other data so that we may provide the Services (collectively, "Customer Data"). We are not liable for any failure to perform Services that is caused by your delay or failure to provide Customer Data.

You hereby grant to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license during the term of this Agreement to use, reproduce, electronically distribute, and publicly display any Customer Data solely for the purpose of providing the Services. You represent and warrant that you own sufficient right, title, and interest in and to your data in order to grant the license in this section.

We aggregate Customer Data with other data so that results are non-personally identifiable and we also collect de-identified technical logs and data regarding use of the Services ("Aggregate/De-identified Data"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any such Aggregate/De-identified Data may be used by IMI for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement, including without limitation to develop and improve the Services and to create and distribute reports and other materials. Customer Data may also persist and be displayed in the system for a limited period of time not to exceed 180 days after a job is complete, for example as automatic calibration or validation data for Intuition Machines systems. For clarity, this Section 5 does not give us the right to identify you as the source of any Aggregate/De-identified Data without your prior written permission.

‍_For the avoidance of doubt, the following paragraph applies exclusively to Customers using our annotation services, and not to use of our Services as an Integrator_. If you are a Customer of our annotation services and have selected the "Data For All" option as part of your use of the Services, then you grant to IMI and all users of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license to fully exploit all Customer Data, including all related intellectual property rights. If you do select the "Data for All" option, you represent and warrant that you own sufficient right, title, and interest in and to your data in order to grant the license in this section.

If your data contain potentially explicit or offensive content, we require you to mark them "EXPLICIT CONTENT" to serve as fair warning to anyone who sees your data. You may not without a separate written agreement with IMI include tasks that violate our policies, including, but not limited to, (a) tasks that directly or indirectly promote another website or service, (b) tasks that violate a third party website's terms and conditions, (c) tasks asking Contributors to solicit third parties, (d) tasks that ask Contributors to take action to manipulate a website's behavior or results, (e) tasks that violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, and (f) tasks that require Contributors to download software or files.

6\. Acceptable Behavior

You are encouraged to interact with other users anywhere on our website, Forum, messaging, chat, and other social media channels controlled by IMI, but if you do so you must comply with all terms of service and use on our site and all relevant laws.

Please note that your access to our service requires compliance with all applicable laws. We may choose to block or remove your account and any associated resources if your service:

* Contains, displays, distributes, or encourages the creation of child sexual abuse material, or otherwise exploits or promotes the exploitation of minors;

* Has been determined by appropriate legal process to be defamatory or libelous;

* Contains, installs, or disseminates any active malware, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system);
* Is otherwise illegal, harmful, or violates the rights of others, including content that discloses sensitive personal information, incites or exploits violence against people or animals, or seeks to defraud the public.

register for more than one account with us without written authorization;

otherwise engage in any malicious or fraudulent activity.  
  
8\. Verifying your Identity

IMI may verify your identity. This may include comparing your personal information against third party databases or official legal documents. You authorize us to make any inquiries necessary to confirm your identity, your ownership of your email address, and your ownership of your financial accounts. You agree to provide information about you to assist us in verifying your identity.

9\. Compliance with the Law

You alone are responsible for complying with federal, state, provincial, and local laws in connection with your use of the Services. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any claims against us because you failed to comply with any law or violated any third party rights, including without limitation contractual, intellectual property, or privacy rights.  
‍

10\. Contributor or Integrator Taxes

If you are a Contributor or Integrator, you alone are responsible for payment of any estimated or other federal, state, or local income taxes, social security, FICA, and workers' compensation owed as a result of use of our website, as well as similar taxes or charges in non-U.S. jurisdictions. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any assessments against us because you failed to comply with any tax laws.

11\. Violation of These Terms of Service

We may suspend, limit, or cancel your access to the Services at any time for any reason, including because: (a) we believe you have violated these Terms of Service (including other related policies); (b) we believe you have violated our rights or the rights of any third party; (c) we are unable to verify or authenticate information you have provided to us; or (d) we believe your actions may create liabilities for you, us, or a third party. For the avoidance of doubt, we reserve the right to prevent or suspend payment to you if we reasonably believe that any of the foregoing applies to such payment.

If we suspend or terminate your account, you will no longer have access to any parts of the website, including data, messages, files, and other material you keep on the site. You may NOT continue to use our website under a different or new account name. Violations of these Terms of Service may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and may result in additional penalties and sanctions.

12\. Contributor's Role and Relationship with IMI and Other Requesters

If you are a Contributor, you and only you decide which and how many tasks to complete, and when and where you complete them. You are free to spend as much or as little time completing tasks as you choose. At no time are you under any obligation to complete a task.

If you are a Contributor who accesses the Services and/or performs tasks through or in connection with an Integrator on behalf of a Requester that is not IMI, then you agree and acknowledge that Intuition Machines is not liable for and has no obligation to you with respect to any rewards or other compensation for completed tasks. You agree and acknowledge that any rewards or other compensation for completed tasks is determined solely in accordance with your agreement with the Requester and/or the Integrator, as applicable. Any disputes over such rewards or other compensation (including without limitation failure to receive such rewards or other compensation) are solely between you and the Requester and/or the Integrator, as applicable.

Neither your use of our website nor anything in this agreement creates an employment, partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, or sales representative relationship between you and Intuition Machines. We do not provide you with any equipment or tools to complete a task. We do not provide you any benefits, workers' compensation, or insurance coverage. We are not responsible for any expenses you incur in using our website. We will not withhold any amount from your reward for federal or state income tax, Social Security, or any other tax. You are free at all times to perform tasks for any person or business, including any of our competitors. You do not have the authority to enter into any contract, written or oral, on behalf of Intuition Machines.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a U.S. taxpayer we may request from you a W-9, to be updated annually, and we may bar you from performing tasks until you have completed or updated a W-9.

If you are a Contributor who accesses the Services and/or performs tasks through or in connection with an Integrator on behalf of Intuition Machines (acting as a Requester), Intuition Machines may reward you for acceptable completion of certain tasks. In the event you are found to have engaged in fraud, abuse, or violation of these Terms of Service, any and all rewards to you may be withheld and/or recovered by Intuition Machines.

13\. Unacceptable Completion of Tasks

If, for any reason, the Requester does not accept performance of a task you completed, you as a Contributor or Integrator will not be entitled to any reward for the task. In the event that rewards were already dispersed to you for an unacceptably completed task, we may recover them from you.

14\. Contributor Qualifications and Skills

By performing tasks, you may accrue qualifications and skills, which we will grant in our discretion. We reserve the right to create, edit, or revoke your qualifications and skills at any time, for any reason or no reason at all. Because we do not discriminate on the basis of national origin, race, color, gender, sexual orientation, or any other class protected by law, you will have the same opportunity as any other Contributor to achieve access to tasks as your qualifications and skills accumulate. As a Contributor, if you believe that problematic test questions have affected your qualifications, skills, or rewards, you may provide well-supported contentions describing of problematic test questions via the task interface or via a ticket in our support system, for example via email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.hcaptcha.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

15\. Our Use of Information

By performing tasks on our website, you authorize the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In addition, we may share certain information about you and your completed tasks to the Requester whose tasks you have completed to facilitate the service relationship and improve the website, including, for example, Contributor ID, results of completed tasks, and other attributes related to your qualifications, languages, skills, and use of the website.

16\. Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights

IMI owns all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the source code, object code or underlying structure, ideas or algorithms, API, and any additional software, documentation or data related to the Services ("Software"). You will not, directly or indirectly, via a third party or otherwise: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the Software; (b) modify, translate, or create derivative works based on any Software; (c) copy, rent, lease, distribute, pledge, assign, or otherwise transfer or encumber rights to any Software; (d) use any Software for timesharing, service bureau purposes, or otherwise for the benefit of a third party; or (e) remove any proprietary notices or labels.

If you are a Contributor, IMI, and not you, has proprietary rights in any work you produce as part of completing any task. By accepting the terms of this Agreement you agree to (and hereby do) transfer possession, ownership, and title (including all intellectual property rights existing throughout the world) in and to your work to us. To ensure that we are able to acquire, perfect, and use such rights, you further agree to (i) sign any documents to assist in the documentation, perfection and enforcement of our rights; and (ii) provide reasonable access to information for recording, perfecting, securing, defending, and enforcing such proprietary rights in any and all countries. Your obligations under this section will continue even after you deregister from or cease use of the Services. You appoint us as your attorney-in-fact to execute documents on your behalf for the purposes set forth in this section.

17\. Copyright and TakeDown

IMI respects the intellectual property of others and we reserve the right to remove from our site any material that we believe may violate the intellectual rights of any third party. If you believe that your own work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement on this website, please contact Intuition Machines customer support.

18\. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs), arising from or relating to your performance of tasks or your use of our website.

19\. Disputes with Other Users; Release

IMI is not a party to any dispute between you and any another user of the Services. You release IMI and its affiliates from any and all claims, demands, and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or connected with any dispute between you and another user.

20\. Confidential Information You Receive

Confidential information is any information that is marked as confidential or proprietary, or which should reasonably be understood by the receiving party to be confidential or proprietary. This does not include any information that is (1) publicly available, (2) already in the possession of, developed independently by, or already known to the receiving party, or (3) has been disclosed by court order or as otherwise required by law.

If you are provided with confidential information from anyone on the Services, you agree to protect the secrecy of the confidential information with the same degree of care you use to protect your own confidential information, but in no event with less than due care. You may not disclose or publish any such confidential or proprietary information, except as may be necessary for performance of a task. All information within a task on the Intuition Machines Platform should be considered as confidential even if the information is not expressly designated as confidential.

If and when you no longer need the confidential information you received, you must promptly return or destroy (as requested by whoever disclosed the information) all copies of the information that exist on the premises, systems, or other equipment you control.

Because disclosing confidential information may cause irreparable harm, the disclosing party is entitled to seek injunctive relief for any breach or threatened breach of this term.

22\. Third-Party Websites

Our website may contain links to third-party websites. We do not control, investigate, monitor, or check such websites.

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH COSTS OR DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE LIMITED REMEDIES PROVIDED HEREIN FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

25\. Contributor Dispute Resolution

If you are a Contributor, you agree to the following arbitration clause and class action waiver:

Alternative Dispute Resolution Required.

You agree that for any dispute that arises out of or relates to your use of the Services, including any dispute that may have arisen from the time that you began performing tasks for IMI, and specifically including any claim related to whether or not you classify as an independent contractor, you will first notify IMI of your claim against it. You and IMI will then attempt to resolve the issue through either direct negotiation or mediation. We will split equally the cost of mediation and agree that mediation shall be conducted through telephonic or other electronic means. If a claim remains unresolved following informal negotiations or mediation, you agree that you and IMI will use final and binding arbitration to resolve the dispute. This clause governs all claims retroactively from the time you began using our website, whether based on tort, contract, statute, including, but not limited to, any claims of discrimination and harassment, whether they be based on the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, or any other state or federal law or regulation, equitable law, or otherwise.

Arbitration Procedure.

All arbitration under this agreement will be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association or by a mutually agreed upon arbitration service. The arbitrator will be a U.S. arbitrator selected from a list of no less than seven (7) names through alternative strikes. In arbitration, each party will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the arbitrator. Resolution of the dispute shall be based solely upon the law governing the claims and defenses pleaded, and the arbitrator may not invoke any basis other than such controlling law. The arbitrator shall have the immunity of a judicial officer from civil liability when acting in the capacity of an arbitrator, which immunity supplements any other existing immunity. Awards must include the arbitrator's written reasoned opinion. You give up your right to trial by jury of any claim you may have against IMI or that IMI may have against you. Any claim under this clause must be brought within the applicable statute of limitations period. The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs this clause, and you acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction in commerce.

Exceptions.

Disputes that may not be subject to predispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) are excluded from this

Administrative Exhaustion.

You may bring any claim arising out of your use of this website to an administrative agency but only to the extent applicable law permits access to such an agency notwithstanding the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. Such administrative claims include without limitation claims or charges brought before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the National Labor Relations Board. Nothing in this clause shall be deemed to preclude or excuse you from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill your obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration, however, you waive the right to any monetary award through this such agency proceedings.

Location of Arbitration.

Any arbitration proceeding under this section will take place by default within the State of California, unless you reside outside the United States, in which case the arbitration will take place entirely electronically or telephonically. The arbitration may take place at any other location if agreed to by every party in writing. Regardless of its location, any party may opt to appear at the arbitration via live video or teleconference.

Class Action Waiver.

You waive any right you have for any dispute to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, or representative action. Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this agreement, the preceding sentence shall not be severable from this agreement in any case. Any claim that all or part of this waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. You will not be retaliated against or prevented from completing tasks on our website as a result of your exercising your rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or by the filing of or participation in a class, collective or representative action in any forum, but we may lawfully seek enforcement of this class action waiver, and seek dismissal of such class, collective or representative actions or claims.

Costs and Fees.

The parties shall each bear their respective costs for legal representation at any such arbitration, except to the extent that attorney's fees are explicitly provided for by law. The parties will split any initial administrative fee charged by the arbitrator, up to a maximum cost to you of two hundred fifty dollars (US$250.00). The cost of the arbitrator and court reporter, if any, shall initially be borne by us; however, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to award appropriate costs to the prevailing party, as provided by law, and/or to require the parties to split the costs associated with the arbitrator and/or court reporter.

Severability.

Except for the Class Action Waiver, if any term or provision, or portion of this arbitration clause is declared void or unenforceable it will be severed and the remainder of the arbitration clause will be enforceable.

26\. Applicable Law

The laws of the State of California govern these Terms of Service and any controversy, dispute, or claim arising from them.

27\. Termination

You may choose at any time to cease using our website, provided that you must abide by all applicable IMI policies. We may, in our sole discretion, terminate this agreement, suspend access to our website, or remove any services immediately without notice for any reason.

28\. General Terms

Customer Appendix to the Master Terms of Service
------------------------------------------------

As a Customer, Requester, or Integrator, you agree to be bound by the below terms in addition to any other binding terms between you and IMI.

1\. Platform Order Forms

You may have completed one or more platform access order forms (each, an "Order Form") as a condition of becoming a Customer or Requester.  If so, then the terms and conditions described in the Order Form become part of the Terms of Service and are hereby incorporated by reference.

2\. Fees

You will pay IMI the fees as described in the applicable Order Form via the payment method you provided in the applicable Order Form. Unless otherwise expressly agreed to by both parties in writing, you will provide full payment for all invoices issued within thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the invoice. You authorize us to run credit card authorizations on all credit card information you provide to us, to store that credit card information, and to charge your credit card or any other account we mutually agree to as a form of payment. Unless stated otherwise on the Order Form or within your Enterprise Service Agreement or Master Service Agreement, all fees for Services, aside from overages, are billed annually upon the start of services provided by IMI under your Agreement (the "Effective Date").

Any late payments will accrue late charges at the rate of 1.5% percent per month or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is lower. If you fail to pay the amount due under this Agreement for any reason, your account may be suspended, at our sole discretion, in which case no additional payments will be made from your account for completion of tasks and all of your tasks will be removed from our website. You must reimburse us for all amounts due upon demand, plus any processing fees, late fees, or attorney fees. We may also make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities.

If you wish to dispute any fees, you must contact our customer support department no later than thirty (30) days after the closing date on the first billing or account statement in which the error or problem appeared in order to receive an adjustment or credit.

3\. Taxes

You are responsible for payment of all taxes associated with the Services other than U.S. taxes assessed on Intuition Machines' net income or personal property.

4\. API

You may be required to integrate your website, application, or platform with our Services via our application programming interface ("API"). In the event that you do so, we grant you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonassignable, revocable license to use the API solely to access the Services. We may modify the API and/or cease support of old versions or releases of the API at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or limit your access to the API in our sole discretion, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you notice prior to suspension.

5\. Protection of Confidential Information

You agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to protect any Confidential Information received from us or via our Services. includes bot scores and non-public details of our enterprise service, including non-public documentation and any details we may share regarding our bot detection methods. If you are granted access to any such Confidential Information, we may modify, suspend, or limit your access to our Services in our sole discretion if we determine that Confidential Information is being exposed by your use of our Services, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you notice prior to suspension.

6\. Termination

You may terminate this Customer Appendix independent of the Terms of Service by ceasing to be a Customer or Requester. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your status as a Customer or Requester at any time, or to otherwise terminate your account or use of the Services consistent with the Terms of Service. You remain liable upon termination for any amount due under your Order Form. If your subscription includes any monthly or annual fees or monthly or annual minimums, you will still be responsible for paying for all Services fees through the end of that month or year, respectively.

Except where we terminate this Customer Appendix or the Terms of Service as a result of your breach of this Customer Appendix or the Terms of Service, if we terminate and you have prepaid any fees to us, we will refund a pro-rata portion of those prepaid amounts, based on the remaining time or Services you have paid for, whichever is less. We will wind up our work in a commercially reasonable manner and preserve and deliver to you all paid-for Output Data Sets and all Customer Data in our possession. Upon any termination, we may but are not obliged to delete any data.

7\. Overages

The maximum permitted peak RPS rate for hCaptcha Integrators or Customers is one thousand (1,000) requests per second to entities within your account ("RPS"), unless otherwise specified by a written contractual agreement between you and us.

The maximum number of requests per month permitted under the hCaptcha Publisher (free) tier is one million (1,000,000) for Integrators, aside from use of the hCaptcha Services in a web application firewall or DDoS protection context, in which case the maximum number of monthly requests permitted is one hundred thousand (100,000). In the event that you exceed this quota without prior written authorization from us, your account will no longer be eligible for earnings, and we may elect to terminate your service if you continue to exceed the Publisher request quota. Please note that this quota applies across all accounts used by an organization or individual: in the event that you have signed up for ten free accounts, the total permitted requests per month is shared across them.

Please note that only 100,000 requests per month are potentially eligible for earnings. Accounts that exceed this quantity of requests will no longer be eligible for earnings in that quarterly cycle. Similarly, earnings for eligible accounts do not roll over: accounts that do not reach the minimum payout threshold of 10 USD in a quarterly cycle window, do not opt in for a withdrawal during that that cycle and prior to reconciliation, or do not provide valid PayPal accounts prior to attempted transfers, will not retain those earnings points in the next cycle.

In the event that you are an Integrator or Customer of the hCaptcha Enterprise service and your API usage as measured by RPS exceeds the provisioned rate for your service tier, we may elect to modify your service or to charge an overage rate. In the event that your peak RPS rate exceeds the provisioned rate by a factor of 10 for 10 or more minutes in total within a 30 day period and the majority of these requests are, in our sole judgment, not malicious traffic, we may elect to charge you at your contractually specified overage rate for all API requests made in that month.

8\. Resale

Unless expressly permitted in Customer’s Master Service Agreement or Reseller Agreement, ordered SaaS Services shall not be sold, resold, leased, sub-leased, licensed, sub-licensed, or otherwise made available to any other third party (other than an Affiliate of Customer), and all orders under the Agreement and all Customer use of the Service shall be for Customer’s or its Affiliate’s own internal business use.

9\. Billing Units

If you are a Customer of the hCaptcha Service, you will be billed for evaluations ("Billing Units") by a formula based upon the number of requests made to site keys associated with your account or organization. The calculated value will be accessible to you under the "billing\_units" key in the metrics API if you are an Enterprise Customer, or on your invoice if you are a Pro Customer.

In most cases the count of Billing Units in a period will be similar or identical to the number of requests shown in your Traffic Overview dashboard, but in some cases it may be lower or higher.

For example, in the event of a high RPS attack against your site keys attempting to create a denial of service, we may elect not to charge you for Serves that are determined by us to be related to that attack. Similarly, in some cases our system may perform a second evaluation on a request or a user, which will cause as an increment in the Billing Units. This may happen in a variety of scenarios, for example if the user aborts a session after we have performed an evaluation but before data has fully loaded and client-side rendering is complete.

9\. Sanctions, Embargoes, and Other Restrictions on Use  
  
You acknowledge and agree that the Service and any of its data accessed by you shall not be used, transferred or otherwise exported or re-exported to countries upon which the United States or European Union member states maintain an embargo (collectively, "Embargoed Countries"), or to or by a national or resident thereof, or any person or entity on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List, Denied Persons List, or Unverified List, or the U.S. Department of State’s Nonproliferation Sanctions list (collectively, "Designated Nationals"). The lists of Embargoed Countries and Designated Nationals are subject to change without notice. By using the Service, including without limitation by uploading or accessing any data, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of an Embargoed Country or Designated National. You agree to comply strictly with all U.S. and E.U. export laws and assume sole responsibility for obtaining United States or European Union member government export licenses to export or re-export as may be required. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless IMI and its suppliers and licensors from and against any violation of such laws or regulations by you or any of your agents, officers, directors or employees.

No person, entity, or organization sanctioned by the United States (a "Sanctioned Actor") or located in, organized under the laws of, or maintaining the citizenship of any Embargoed Countries is eligible for rewards or to use the Services as an Integrator. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes any Sanctioned Actors designated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") of the US Department of the Treasury.

For the avoidance of doubt, we also reserve the right to remove earnings eligibility, including retroactively, or terminate accounts for residents and citizens of countries designated as high risk by us at our sole discretion. This list currently includes citizens of the Russian Federation (Russia) and Belarus.

10\. Integrator Incentives

Please note: the Integrator Incentives program is ending effective June 15, 2023. After that date, no account will be eligible for incentives. The terms in this section 10 ("Integrator Incentives") apply to traffic received prior to that date.

We may from time to time make Integrator accounts eligible for incentives. These incentives are currently denominated via HMT points, where 1 HMT point is equal to 1 US dollar. Your incentive points may be increased, decreased, or eliminated at any time, including retroactively, at our sole discretion. PayPal is currently the only means of receiving these incentive points in cash form. Incentives are only available to Integrators with valid PayPal accounts and eligibility remains subject to all of our other Terms, including Sections 7 and 9. Payment schedules, formulas for calculating incentives, and types of requests eligible may change at any time. Information on payment schedules is maintained at: [https://www.hcaptcha.com/payment-schedules](https://www.hcaptcha.com/payment-schedules). Incentives do not accrue across payment schedule windows. If you have not opted in for a withdrawal using a valid PayPal account prior to a payment period's reconciliation window, you will no longer be eligible to receive incentives related to traffic in that period.

You may alternatively assign any benefit from your incentives to a registered charity from the list made available on the Settings page in our dashboard, in which case a periodic aggregated payment from all eligible traffic may be made to that charity, subject to our Terms. Please note that this assignment of incentive points is not tax deductible by you.

Business Continuity Planning Statement
--------------------------------------

Intuition Machines, Inc has developed a Business Continuity Plan on how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our hCaptcha business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.

‍**Contacting Us** – If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at [\[email protected\]](https://www.hcaptcha.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), you should go to our website at hcaptcha.com or hcaptchastatus.com.

‍**Our Business Continuity Plan** – We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers and their end users to transact online. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.  Our business continuity plan addresses: data backup and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and oversight bodies; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier and customer impact; regulatory reporting; and giving our customers prompt notice if we are unable to continue our business. Our core supplier pool backs up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by this supplier pool that their objective is to restore their own operations and be able to resume services rapidly. Although we have worked to reduce risk by using a diverse set of suppliers, your services could be modified or interrupted during this period.**‍**

**Varying Disruptions** – Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the neighborhood where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to our firm, our business district, city, or region or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect no material disruption to business operations. In either situation, we plan to continue in business, transfer operations to alternative suppliers if necessary, and notify you through our website at hcaptcha.com and our status page at hcaptchastatus.com as to how to contact us. If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will notify you expeditiously.
