**Types of Information Collected**

We collect two categories of information: (1) information that personally identifies you (for example, your name and e-mail address) that you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, register, complete a survey, or initiate some other transaction or communication. Personal identifiable information may include: (i) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing and e-mail addresses); (ii) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); and (iii) Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age and income). If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards, comment areas or forums, surveys or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as personal information as well, and (2) non-personally identifying information, which includes information about usage patterns and preferences as users navigate around our sites or use our information services. In some cases, an agent, affiliate, or business partner of WEHCO Media, Inc. collects the information. Third party providers featured on our sites, such as vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information.

**Uses of Information Collected**

We use your information to help you use and navigate our products and services, such as our mobile and tablet apps or website. We also use this data to provide customer service or respond to inquiries or contact requests. Furthermore, we use contact data to send you information about our company or our products or services, or promotional material from us or some of our partners, or to contact you when necessary (for example – to provide receipts of transactions, subscription updates, or notify you of account issues). We use your financial data to verify your qualifications for certain products or services and to bill you for products and services.

We do not sell names, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information you enter on our sites to any third parties, including advertisers, unless we have your permission to do so, such as through a registration for a contest, survey, or particular services or information.
