Terms & Conditions

Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy
==============================================

We previously had 2 sign-in areas available on our homepage at starclassifieds.com: One for our listings site (starclassifieds.com) for users to save ads as favourites, and another for our customers to book/update their ad orders. The 2 sign-in's were causing confusion with many users, so we decided to remove the sign-in for our listings site. The only sign-in available now is for users/customers to place or edit their orders.

Please read these terms of use (“Terms of Service”) carefully before using Adportal, which will be referred to in this document as “this site.” By using this Site, you agree to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Arkansas Online reserves the right to terminate or deny access to this Site to any person who violates these Terms of Service, or for any other reason.

By accessing or otherwise using this Site, you expressly agree to these Terms of Service as a binding legal agreement between you and Arkansas Online. Arkansas Online reserves the right, at any time, to modify, alter, or update these Terms of Service without prior notice. You will be notified of any such changes by an updated posting of the new Terms of Service on this page of the Site.

3\. Advertising Submitted by Users.  
a. Confirming your Order for an advertisement (“Advertising”) through this Site constitutes acceptance of these Terms of Service, Standards of Acceptability, and applicable provisions of the publications you selected to publish your Advertising.

b. All advertisements must include the name of the Advertiser. Physical address of advertiser must be on file.

c. All property rights, including any copyright interest in advertisements produced for an Advertiser by Arkansas Online, using art work and/or typography furnished or arranged by Arkansas Online, shall be the sole property of Arkansas Online. No such advertisement or any part thereof may be reproduced without the prior written consent of Arkansas Online.

d. Arkansas Online reserves the right to edit, revise or reject any advertising. Advertiser agrees to indemnify and save harmless Arkansas Online against any loss, damage, cost and expense (including, without limitation, attorney’s fees) which Arkansas Online may incur, or become liable for, by reason of any and all claims or actions for libel, violation of any right of privacy, plagiarism, copyright infringement, and any and all other claims of any kind or nature in connection with advertising matter published or advertiser by Arkansas Online.

e. Arkansas Online shall have no liability whatsoever in the event of any act of God, the public enemy or governmental authority, labor dispute, war (whether or not declared), civil disobedience, riot, failures of equipment or systems of Arkansas Online or its suppliers, or other occurrences beyond its control that shall in any way restrict or prevent the distribution of its newspapers and/or publication of the advertising.

f. No allowance will be made for advertisements appearing in other than requested positions.

g. Arkansas Online shall have no liability whatsoever, including without limitation any liability for consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages for not publishing any advertisement or by reason of any error in connection with any advertisement (including, without limitation, typographical errors, failure to publish advertising on desired dates, omissions or additions to advertisement\[s\]); provided, however, that Arkansas Online shall be obligated to adjust or rebate the charge on any advertisement or any portion of an advertisement which has been materially affected by an error of Arkansas Online; and provided further, however, that Arkansas Online’s obligation to give such credit shall not apply to more than one incorrect insertion of such advertisement unless and until Arkansas Online is notified of the error 24 hours prior to repetition of the insertion.

In order to insure the accuracy of all space reservations, all verbal reservations must be confirmed in writing by the day of the actual space deadline, or within 24 hours. Arkansas Online is not responsible for any error in scheduling if no written confirmation is received.

i. The use of coupons in advertisements is encouraged, and care is taken to position the coupon ads to avoid printing coupons back-to-back. Due to press limitations and emergency make-up changes, however, it is possible that coupons may print back-to-back. No rebates or make-goods will be allowed in any event and for any reason.
