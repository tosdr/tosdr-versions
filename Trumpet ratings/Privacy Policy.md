**7\. COOKIES POLICY**

**7.1** **What Are Cookies**

SMG and our service providers use small text files called cookies. **“****Cookies**” are small computer files sent to or accessed from your web browser or your computer's, mobile device’s or tablet’s hard drive that contain information about your computer, such as a user ID, user settings, browsing history, and activities conducted while using the Services. A Cookie typically contains the domain name (internet location) from which the Cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the Cookie (i.e., when it expires), and a randomly generated unique number or identifier. Cookies may be linked to Personal Data.

**7.2 How We Use Cookies and Data Collection Tools**

Cookies help us improve SMG Services by tracking your navigation habits, and customizing your experience with SMG Services. This enables us to analyze technical and navigational information about SMG Services and helps us to detect and prevent fraud.

We also use Cookies and other Data Collection Tools (such as web beacons and server logs), which we collectively refer to as “ **Data Collection Tools,”** to help improve your experience with SMG Services – for example, by remembering you when you come back to visit us, and making the content you see more relevant to you.

SMG Services also may use Data Collection Tools to collect information from the device you use to access SMG Services, such as your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone in which your device is located.

Web browsers allow some control of most Cookies through browser settings. Some web browsers (including mobile web browsers) provide settings that allow you to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. You may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required to accept SMG’s Cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through SMG Services. In addition, if you reside in a jurisdiction that requires us to obtain your consent to use cookies on our websites and/or applications, you will have an opportunity to manage your cookie preferences on those websites and/or applications; except that certain cookies are required to enable the core functionality of such websites and applications and you cannot choose to disable those cookies.

**8\. ONLINE ADVERTISING AND DATA COLLECTION**

**8.1 Online Advertising.**

Our advertising management partners use Data Collection Tools on our site to enable them to recognize a unique Cookie that has been placed on your browser, which in turn enables us and these ad management partners to learn which advertisements bring users to the TrumpetRatings. In addition, we and our ad management partners may use these Data Collection Tools to track the actions of users of the TrumpetRatings, to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, and to deliver advertisements on the TrumpetRatings that may be more relevant to you.

We and our ad management partners also may use Data Collection Tools to record the actions of users of the TrumpetRatings, to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, to deliver advertisements on the TrumpetRatings that may be more relevant to individual consumers and to improve the consumer experience on the TrumpetRatings.

We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("**Principles**"). This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest based advertising purposes. More information about these Principles can be found [here](http://www.aboutads.info/principles/).

**8.2** **Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertisements** .

An "opt-out" Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements. If you delete Cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again.

Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on TrumpetRatings; rather, opting out means that the online ads that you do see will not be based on your particular interests.

In addition, when you opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements through the links above, Data Collection Tools on TrumpetRatings may still collect information about your use of TrumpetRatings for any purpose permitted under the Principles, including for analytics, fraud prevention and any other permitted purpose.
