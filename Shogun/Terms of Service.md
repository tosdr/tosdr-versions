Thank you for using Shogun! To be eligible to register for a Shogun account and use Shogun Software (as defined below), you must review and accept these Shogun Terms of Service (this “**_Agreement_**” or these “**_Terms_**” ) by clicking on the “Get” or “Signup” button or other mechanism provided. PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OR USING THE SHOGUN SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WITH SHOGUN LABS, INC. (“**_SHOGUN_**“). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT CLICK THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON AND YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SHOGUN SOFTWARE.

In this Agreement, “you,” “your” and “Customer” will refer to you. If you are registering for a Shogun account or using the Shogun Software on behalf of an entity or other organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that entity or organization and representing to Shogun that you have the authority to bind that entity or organization to these Terms (and, in which case, the terms “you”, “your” and “Customer” will refer to that entity or organization).

IMPORTANT NOTES:

* SHOGUN DOES NOT PROVIDE WARRANTIES OR INDEMNITIES FOR THE SHOGUN SOFTWARE, AND THESE TERMS LIMIT SHOGUN’S LIABILITY TO YOU.
* DISPUTES RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE SHOGUN SOFTWARE MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.

#### 1\. Certain Definitions

1.1 The following terms, when used in this Agreement will have the following meanings:

**_“Confidential Information”_** means any information or data disclosed by either party that is marked or otherwise designated as confidential or proprietary or that should otherwise be reasonably understood to be confidential in light of the nature of the information and the circumstances surrounding disclosure. However, “Confidential Information” will not include any information which (a) is in the public domain through no fault of receiving party; (b) was properly known to receiving party, without restriction, prior to disclosure by the disclosing party; (c) was properly disclosed to receiving party, without restriction, by another person with the legal authority to do so; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.

**_“Customer Content”_** means any information, data, graphics, content and other materials provided or made available to Shogun by Customer (or, if Customer is an agency, Customer’s clients for which Customer is an agency of record (\*\*\*”Agency Clients”\*\*\*)) for the purpose of building a Customer Website.

**_“Customer Website”_** means a website branded with Customer’s trademarks (or, if Customer is an agency, those of its Agency Clients) and operated by or on behalf of Customer (or, if Customer is such an agency, its Agency Clients) that uses an e-commerce platform that has integrated the Shogun Software, for which Customer is permitted to use the Shogun Software as set forth in Customer’s Shogun account.

#### 2\. Changes

2.1 _These Terms_. Shogun may revise these Terms from time to time.

Shogun will provide you advance notice of any material revisions. This notice will be provided via the account portal and/or via an email to the email address Shogun has on file. For other revisions, Shogun will update the effective date of these Terms at the top of the page. Shogun encourages you to check the effective date of these Terms whenever you visit Shogun’s website or account portal. Your continued access or use of the Shogun Software constitutes your acceptance of any revisions, effective at the beginning of your next subscription renewal. If you don’t agree to the revisions, you should cancel your subscription to the Shogun Software. Subject to the foregoing, no amendment or modification to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights hereunder, will be effective unless assented to in writing by both parties.

2.2 _Shogun Software_. You acknowledge that Shogun may change or deprecate any feature of the Shogun Software from time to time, and that it is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to the Shogun Software are compatible with then-current version of the Shogun Software.

#### 3\. Shogun Software

3.1 _Provision of Shogun Software_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Shogun Acceptable Use Policy (available at https://www.getshogun.com/aup) (the “**_AUP_**“), Shogun will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Shogun Software available to Customer pursuant to this Agreement based on the pricing plan for the Shogun Software selected by Customer. Customer may permit its third party contractors, subject to confidentiality and use obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement, to access and use the Shogun Software solely in connection with services provided by such third party contractors to Customer. If Customer is an agency, such rights may, as agreed by the parties, be restricted to access and use on behalf of only certain Agency Clients, and Customer will only use the Shogun Software on behalf of such Agency Clients that have authorized Customer to use the Shogun Software on their behalf within the scope of Customer’s other _bona fide_ agency responsibilities for such Agency Client.

3.2 _Customer Responsibilities_. Customer acknowledges that Shogun’s performance of the Shogun Software is dependent on Customer providing all reasonably required cooperation (including the prompt provision of access to Customer APIs (if applicable), personnel and Customer Content), and Customer will provide all such cooperation in a diligent and timely manner.

3.3 _Ownership Rights_. As between the parties, Shogun owns and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Shogun Software and any improvements thereto, and Customer (or, if Customer is an agency, its Agency Client(s)) owns and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Content and Customer Websites (excluding any Shogun Software embedded therein). No rights are granted other than as expressly set forth herein.

3.4 _Feedback_. Customer may from time to time provide Shogun suggestions or comments for enhancements or improvements, new features or functionality or other feedback (\*\*\*”Feedback”\*\*\*) with respect to the Shogun Software. Shogun will have the full, unencumbered right to use, incorporate and otherwise fully exercise and exploit any such Feedback in connection with its products and services.

3.5 _Shogun Platform Improvements and Marketing_. Notwithstanding anything herein, Shogun shall have the right to collect and analyze data and other information relating to the use and performance of the Shogun Software and related systems and technologies and Shogun will be free to (i) use such information and data to develop, improve and provide Shogun’s offerings, and (ii) use and disclose such data in aggregate or other anonymous and de-identified form for marketing purposes and otherwise in connection with its business.

3.6 _Data Processing Addendum and Privacy Shield_.

Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding on the parties and their successors and assigns.

10.4 _Waiver_. Any such waiver will be only to the specific provision and under the specific circumstances for which it was given, and will not apply with respect to any repeated or continued violation of the same provision or any other provision.

There shall be no force or effect to any different terms of any pre-printed purchase order or similar forms of Customer, even if signed by the parties after the date hereof.

10.10 _Force Majeure_. Neither Party will be deemed in breach hereunder for any cessation, interruption or delay in the performance of its obligations due to causes beyond its reasonable control (“**_Force Majeure Event_**“), including earthquake, flood, or other natural disaster, act of God, labor controversy, civil disturbance, terrorism, war (whether or not officially declared), cyber attacks (e.g., denial of service attacks), or the inability to obtain sufficient supplies, transportation, or other essential commodity or service required in the conduct of its business, or any change in or the adoption of any law, regulation, judgment or decree.

This applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits in one the exceptions below. It also applies even after you have stopped using your Shogun account or have deleted it. If the parties have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to such dispute, the parties agree that the arbitrator will decide that too.

11.3 _Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate_. You and your affiliates on one hand, and Shogun and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that the parties will go to court to resolve disputes relating to your, your affiliate’s, Shogun’s or Shogun’s affiliates intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents) or your violation of the AUP. Also, either party can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where you live, or some other place both parties agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court. In addition, if either party brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or either party refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other party can ask a court to force the parties to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). Either party may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.

11.4 _Details of Arbitration Procedure_.

a. Prior to filing any arbitration, both parties jointly agree to seek to resolve any dispute between the parties by mediation conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“**_AAA_**“), with all mediator fees and expenses paid equally by the parties. If mediation is not successful, either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding with AAA. You can look at AAA’s rules and procedures on their website https://www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be governed by the then-current version of AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “**_Rules_**“) and will be held with a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules. To the extent any thing described in this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the Rules, the language of this agreement to arbitrate applies.

b. Each party will be entitled to get a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party and to take a reasonable number of depositions. All such discovery will be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator. This agreement to arbitrate does not alter in any way the statute of limitations that would apply to any claims or counterclaims asserted by either party.

c. The arbitrator’s award will be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the State of California and the United States, as applicable, and will contain an award for each issue and counterclaim. The award will provide in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award. The arbitrator will not be entitled to modify these Terms.

d. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

11.5 _Class Action Waiver_. Both you and your affiliates, on one hand, and Shogun and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that any claims or controversies between the parties must be brought against each other on an individual basis only. That means neither you and your affiliates on one hand nor Shogun and its affiliates on the other hand can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless both parties agree otherwise). And, the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s or entity’s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Shogun customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers. If a court decides that this class action waiver is not enforceable or valid, then the entire agreement to arbitrate will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.
