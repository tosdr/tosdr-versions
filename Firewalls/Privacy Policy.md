Firewalls.com Security Policy
=============================

### Safe & Secure Buying

When you shop with Firewalls.com, you never have to worry about credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction will be fully secure.

Firewalls.com makes use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with top web browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and more, to ensure that only Firewalls.com can read your personal information.

Online purchases are statistically safer than using your credit card at a restaurant or department store because the information is immediately encrypted into a scrambled message that can only be decrypted by an authorized computer.

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50 due to a fraudulent charge through Firewalls.com, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using our secure server.

In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

Firewalls.com does not store credit card information. It is our company policy not to store your personal credit card information. When checking out, your information is passed to a trusted third party payment system to process your payment. All information passed is using a minimum 128-bit SSL encryption.

Firewalls.com does not sell or distribute your information. We respect your privacy as much as our own. We will never sell, distribute, rent, or post your information. Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.firewalls.com/privacy-policy-cookie-restriction-mode) for more details about how Firewalls.com protects your information.
