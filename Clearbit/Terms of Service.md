### Introduction

In January 2024, Clearbit introduced new Clearbit Services. Clearbit will continue to provide existing customers with Legacy Clearbit Services under the Legacy Terms in an effort to support service continuity.

You represent and warrant to Clearbit that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the Payment Instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date); we may also receive updates on your Payment Instrument through our payment service providers and automatically resume billing. If your Payment Instrument is declined when Clearbit or its Affiliates attempts to charge it, we may try to charge it again at a later time. If Clearbit or its Affiliates does not receive payment, Clearbit will promptly suspend or terminate the Customer’s Services. We assume no responsibility or liability if your access to the Subscription fails to renew or otherwise expires because of outdated or incorrect payment information.

Your Subscription will automatically renew each billing cycle on a recurring basis at which time your credit card will be charged automatically until you cancel your Subscription. You hereby authorize Clearbit or its Affiliates to bill your Payment Instrument for your monthly usage for the self-service Subscriptions entered into through the Site in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan referenced in the self-service Subscription or communicated to you by Clearbit from time to time, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred.

Unless Customer identifies any disputed amounts within fifteen (15) days of receipt of invoice, such invoice shall be deemed undisputed. In the event of a dispute, the parties agree to work together in good faith to resolve such dispute. If the dispute is regarding a portion of an invoice, the undisputed portion shall remain due and payable in accordance with these Terms.

If Customer’s Payment Card is declined when Clearbit or its Affiliates attempts to charge it, we may try to charge it again at a later time (for example, if Customer’s Payment Card has expired or is no longer valid) and we reserve the right, and Customer authorizes Clearbit or its Affiliates, to retry billing Customer’s Payment Card. If Customer updates Payment Card information to remedy a change in validity or expiration date, we will automatically resume billing; we may also receive updates on Customer’s Payment Card through our payment service providers and automatically resume billing.

You will not be required to repay the Deduction Amount to us, provided that you present us with a valid tax receipt verifying payment of the Deduction Amount to the relevant tax authority within ninety (90) days from the date of the invoice.

**9.3.** **Indemnification Process:** The party seeking indemnification under these Terms will: (a) give the indemnifying party prompt written notice of the Claim (provided, that failure to provide such prompt notice will not release the indemnifying party from its indemnity obligations except to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced thereby); (b) tender to the indemnifying party control of the defense and settlement of the Claim; and (c) cooperate with the indemnifying party in defending or settling the Claim. The indemnified party will have the right to participate at its own expense in any indemnification action or related settlement negotiations using counsel of its own choice.

#### **10\. Processor Data**

If we believe that your Instruction infringes Data Protection Laws (where applicable), we will inform you without delay. Customer shall have the right, upon notice, to take reasonable and appropriate steps to (i) ensure that Clearbit uses Processor Data in a manner consistent with Customer's obligations under Data Protection Laws, or (ii) stop and remediate unauthorized Processing of Processor Data.

**10.2.** **Conflict of Laws:** If we become aware that we cannot Process Processor Data in accordance with your Instructions due to a legal requirement under any applicable law, we will (i) promptly notify you of that legal requirement to the extent permitted by the applicable law; and (ii) where necessary, cease all Processing (other than merely storing and maintaining the security of the affected Processor Data) until such time as you issue new Instructions with which we are able to comply. If this provision is invoked, we will not be liable to you under the agreement for any failure to perform the applicable Clearbit Services until such time as you issue new lawful Instructions with regard to the Processing.

**10.3.** **Controller Instructions:** The parties agree that the agreement (including this DPA), together with your use of the Clearbit Services in accordance with the agreement, constitute your complete Instructions to us in relation to the Processing of Processor Data, so long as you may provide additional instructions during the term of the Subscription that are consistent with the agreement and the nature and lawful use of the Clearbit Services.

**10.6.** **Personal Data Breach:** We will notify you without undue delay after we become aware of any Personal Data Breach and will provide timely information relating to the Personal Data Breach as it becomes known or reasonably requested by you.

**10.7.** **Sub-Processors:** Where Clearbit engages Sub-Processors, Clearbit agrees to (i) enter into a written agreement with Sub-Processors that imposes on Sub-Processors data protection and security requirements for Processor Data that comply with Data Protection Laws and provide at least the same level of protection for Processor Data as those in this DPA; and (ii) remain responsible to Customer for Sub-Processors’ compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of Sub-Processors that cause Clearbit to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.

If Customer does not provide timely objection to a new Sub-Processor, Customer will be deemed to have authorized Clearbit’s use of the new Sub-Processor and waived its right to object. If Customer provides timely objection to a new Sub-processor, the parties will discuss Customer's concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached, Clearbit will, at its sole discretion, either not appoint the new Sub-Processor, or permit Customer to suspend or terminate the affected Service in accordance with the termination provisions of the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by Customer prior to suspension or termination).

Such written notice will specify the people, places, or documents to be made available. Any information produced by Clearbit in response to an audit request will be considered Clearbit’s Confidential Information and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, will remain Confidential Information.

Customer will bear the costs that Clearbit incurs when fulfilling such obligations.

**10.12.** **Return and Deletion of Processor Data:** Processor Data (including any copies) shall not be kept longer than is required to provide the Clearbit Services under the agreement, unless (i) a longer retention period is required to comply with applicable laws, including for audit, legal, financial, or regulatory purposes; or (ii) Customer instructs Clearbit in writing to (a) keep certain Processor Data longer, or (b) return certain Processor Data earlier.
