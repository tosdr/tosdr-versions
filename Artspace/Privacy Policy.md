### How it Works

### How bidding works

To place a bid, enter the maximum amount you are willing to pay for the work. Artspace will accept a bid at the next increment, and save any excess amount as a maximum bid. If you are outbid, we will continue bid on your behalf up to your maximum bid.

### Bid Increments

Bidding increments increase at the following intervals:

* Below $400: $50
* Between $400 and $699: $100
* Between $700 and $1,499: $200
* Between $1,500 and $2,499: $300
* Between $2,500 and $4,999: $500
* Between $5,000 and $9,999: $1,000
* Between $10,000 and $19,999: $2,000
* Between $20,000 and $29,999: $3,000
* Between $30,000 and $49,999: $4,000
* Between $50,000 and $99,999: $5,000
* Above $100,000: $10,000

You will receive an email confirmation of your bid and when you are outbid.

If you are the winning bidder, you will be contacted 48 hours after of the close of the auction.

### Maximum Bidding

Every bid submitted is treated as a maximum bid. You should always bid the maximum you are willing to spend for a work, though this does not necessarily mean you will pay that price. As the auction unfolds, we will increase your bid by increments to ensure you remain the highest bidder. If the winning amount is less than your maximum bid, you will pay the current increment. If your maximum bid no longer exceeds the current bid, you will receive an outbid notification email, and have the option to bid again.

In the case of multiple bidders placing the same maximum bid, the first person to place the maximum amount takes precedence as the highest bid until another bidder exceeds the maximum amount.

### Buyer's Premium & Additional Charges

For Artspace Auctions winning bidders are charged a 15% Buyer's Premium on top of the hammer price. For Artspace Benefit Auctions, Buyer's Premiums are not applied. If they are, this will be clearly noted. Purchases made from all auctions, including benefit auctions, are subject to sales tax.

### Check Out

Winning bidders will be contacted within 48 hours to arrange shipping and to provide final price including commission, shipping, and taxes and duties when applicable. Promotion codes cannot be applied to auction works.

\* Price listed does not include buyer's premium (if applicable), sales tax, shipping, or handling fees.

FRAME DETAILS & ELEMENTS

  

### Frame

All our frames are manufactured in the USA, using eco-friendly & sustainably sourced engineered hardwood for durability and a uniform finish that is free of defects. Frames are available in Black or White Satin and Honey Pecan.

*   
    White Satin
*   
    Honey Pecan
*   
    Black Satin

### Mat

All prints are hinged to a conservation quality, acid-free and lignin-free Alpha Cellulose matboard, using an acid-free linen tape. The mat's surface paper is fade and bleed resistant and is attached to a conservation quality foam-core mounting board that will keep the work safe from deterioration over time. Artworks with a deckled or decorative edges will be floated on the matboard, with acrylic spacers to separate the art from the glazing. All mounting is fully reversible, without any potential damage to the art.

### Acrylic Glazing

All of our frames come with picture quality .090 mm plexiglass, which blocks 66% of UV to prevent color fading from exposure to light, keeping your art protected for years to come. It is now considered the industry standard for artists, museums and galleries throughout the world.

### Dimensions

For images up to 30" x 40"

* 1 1/4” wide, 3/4” deep, with a 2 1/2” wide mat.
* We generally leave 1/4” - 1/2” of paper showing around the image, to accommodate signatures and for visual appeal.

For sheet sizes larger than 30” x 40”

* Please contact an Artspace advisor for a custom quote.

  
If you have any questions about framing or care, please email  [email customer service service@artspace.com](mailto:service@artspace.com).
