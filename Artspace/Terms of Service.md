Selling on Artspace

### Relationship of the Parties

The Seller is responsible for accurately describing and pricing the Items it is offering for sale. The Buyer is solely responsible for determining the value, condition and authenticity of the Items being purchased and for paying the purchase price to the Seller including any sales tax, VAT or import/export duties.

The role of Artspace is expressly limited as set forth in the clause above entitled “The Role of Artspace”. Artspace relies on the sellers for such information and is not responsible in any way for the description or pricing of Items on the Site provided by the seller. Artspace is not responsible for the delivery of payment from you to the Seller unless we explicitly agree to be.

### Items available on the site

All Items displayed on the Site are offered for sale subject to availability. Some Items displayed on the Site are unique and are offered by Sellers that usually have retail opportunities for the sale of the Item independent from Artspace, and therefore some Items may no longer be available.

The Site is designed to provide the Buyer access to Items as the Sellers present them. Accordingly, Artspace does not verify any information provided by the Seller (or its representative selling an Item) and Artspace makes no representations or warranties with respect to the Seller, the Item or the information related to the Item.

### Sales are “As-Is”

All Items displayed on the Site are sold “As-Is” and “With All Faults”. Neither the Seller nor Artspace makes any guarantee, warranty or representation, expressed or implied, to any Buyer with respect to any Item, including without limitation, its condition, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quality, rarity, importance, provenance, designer or creator, exhibitions, literature, historical relevance, or as to whether the Buyer acquires any reproduction right or other intellectual property right in any Item. No statement anywhere, whether oral or written, shall be deemed any such guarantee, warranty or representation.

### Auctions

Artspace may make available the Artspace Auctions where sellers may offer goods for sale by auction to the highest bidder. Artspace is independent from the buyers and sellers that participate in the Artspace Auctions and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee or fiduciary relationship is intended or created by the operation of the Artspace Auctions. Artspace may, but is not obligated to provide intermediary services between the buyer and sellers using Artspace Auctions. Artspace reserves the right in its sole discretion and at any time including during an auction to refuse or revoke permission for sellers to offer goods or for buyers to submit bids.

### How bidding works

All bids shall be in United States Dollars. Participating sellers and buyers may be required to register on the site, may select a username and password, and must agree to be bound by these terms. Buyers must register a valid credit card with Artspace and agree to pay a buyer’s premium to Artspace which shall be added to the successful bid price. The buyer’s premium shall be equal 15% of the successful bid price for bids on some auction items. The successful bidder shall pay the purchase price plus the buyer’s premium as the final purchase price. The agreements between the buyers and sellers shall not be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.

Bids are submitted by clicking the “bid” button on the site; all bids are final and cannot be amended or retracted once submitted. All bids will be recorded by Artspace and such recording shall constitute the final and conclusive determination and record of each bid and the highest bid.

### Seller's reserve price

Sellers may set a minimum price for an auction item (“Reserve Price”). A Seller is not required to accept any bids for less than the Reserve Price. If bids are placed below the seller’s Reserve Price, the bidder will be notified that the bid is below the Reserve Price.

### Artspace bidding

Artspace may, through employees, submit bids on auction items that are subject to a Reserve Price. Artspace may (1) submit the opening bid on behalf of the seller at the Reserve Price, (2) place single or successive bids on behalf of the seller in response to other bids that are below the Reserve Price. In no circumstances will Artspace place a bid that is above the Reserve Price.

### Place your bid

Enter any bid amount as long as it is greater than or equal to the "Next Minimum Bid" (displayed below the bid field) and click on "Place Bid". This will automatically place a straight bid at the next increment and hold the bid you submitted (if higher than the "Next Minimum Bid") as your "Maximum Bid". You will receive an email confirmation of your bid and will be notified by email when you are outbid.

By placing a bid each buyer irrevocable authorizes Artspace to immediately charge Buyer’s registered credit card an amount equal to the buyer’s premium.

Please note that if the auction moves to a physical live event (the auction page will specify this and the bidder will be noticed as such by email), the highest bidder after the close of the online auction will be the opening bid at the event and will be notified within 48 hours after the event if the bid is the final winning bid or been outbid by someone at the event.

### Bidding Increments

When placing a bid, enter the maximum amount you are willing to pay for the work. Entering your "Maximum Bid" does not necessarily mean you will pay that price, you may pay less. The Auction system will Proxy Bid on your behalf up to the amount of your Maximum Bid. Once you enter your Maximum Bid, your current bid displayed will be in the amount of the "Next Minimum Bid." As the auction proceeds, Artspace will compare your bid to those of other bidders. When you are outbid, the system automatically bids on your behalf according to the bidding increments established for that auction up to (but never exceeding) your maximum bid. We increase your bid by increments only as much as necessary to maintain your position as highest bidder. Your maximum bid is kept confidential until it is exceeded by another bidder. If your maximum bid is outbid, you will be notified via email so that you can place another bid.

If the auction is a benefit auction or an auction with a physical event (which will be noted on the auction page), all online bids will be transferred to that event and Artspace or the organization running the event will continue to monitor your bids in person and continue Proxy Bidding on your behalf up to your maximum bid. Winning bidders will be notified within 48 hours after the close of the auction. If you are not contacted by Artspace, you were not the highest bidder.

### Closing the Auction

Upon the close of each auction Artspace shall separately confirm the highest bid to the seller and notify the buyer submitting the highest bid that the bid was successful and the amount of the buyer’s premium due to Artspace to be charged to buyer’s credit card. Artspace shall thereupon charge buyer’s credit card in the amount of the buyer’s premium.

Upon receipt of the buyer’s premium Artspace shall email both the successful buyer and seller and shall provide each with the name, address, telephone number and email address of the other; buyer and seller are thereafter solely responsible for arranging for the transmission of payment of the purchase price within 24 hours of the transmission of the Artspace email and for prompt shipment of the goods after receipt of good funds. If for any reason after Artspace’s initial confirmation of the successful bid the buyer cancels the transaction or fails to make payment to the seller, the buyer shall remain liable to Artspace for the full buyer’s premium and Artspace reserves the right to retain such buyer’s premium in addition to any other remedies it has at law or equity.

Any dispute with respect to the auction of any item shall be resolved between buyer and seller and without the participation of Artspace. Seller is solely responsible for collecting payment from the buyer. Artspace does not guaranty and is not responsible in any way for the performance of buyers or sellers participating in the auction.

### Responsibilities of Auction Buyers and Sellers

Goods offered on Artspace Auctions must be tangible goods that meet the requirements of the Site. Sellers shall not offer any goods for sale or consummate any transaction initiated on Artspace Auctions that violates or could cause Artspace to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation. Artspace shall have sole discretion as to whether a specific item meets the requirements of the Site, which determination is final.

Sellers offering goods shall post a description of the goods offered and may set a minimum reserve price, a minimum overbid amount and the termination of the auction of the goods. Sellers agree to accept the highest bid above their set reserve price and to deliver the offered goods to the buyer submitting such highest bid. Any goods offered using a seller’s registration log in information shall be deemed by Artspace and any bidding buyer as being offered or authorized by that seller. Sellers are solely responsible for the description, condition, authenticity, and quality of the goods offered. Sellers represent that they are in compliance with all applicable laws, including without limitation those regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which the seller resides as well as the restrictions on import or export of goods from the seller’s country to the buyer’s country.

By posting goods on the Artspace Auctions each seller represents and warrants that he/she holds free and marketable title to the goods offered and that the sale to any buyer will be free and clear of any and all liens or encumbrances. Sellers agree that Artspace Auctions will publish images and information in English relating to the goods offered by sellers. Sellers are solely responsible for descriptions of goods and all other content provided to Artspace by seller. Each seller agrees that Artspace may reformat content submitted by sellers in order to best serve the needs and formatting of the Artspace Auctions. Sellers grant Artspace a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use the listing information in other areas of the site in our sole discretion.

Sellers are responsible for shipment of goods to successful bidding buyers upon receipt of the purchase price. Sellers must make shipment promptly on receipt of good funds from buyers. Sellers are responsible for collecting any and all applicable taxes from the successful buyer and for remitting such taxes to the applicable taxing authority.

Buyers are responsible for determining the value, condition and authenticity of the goods. Buyers participating in the Artspace Auctions represent and warrant by placing any bid that they are ready, willing and able to pay the purchase price bid, all applicable taxes and the buyer’s premium all within 24 hours of the close of the auction if they are the successful bidder. Any bids submitted using a buyer’s registration log in information shall be deemed made or authorized by that buyer. Each buyer placing any bid represents and warrants that such bids are not the product of any collusive or other anti-competitive agreement and are otherwise consistent with federal and state laws. Each buyer is responsible for payment of New York State and local sales tax, any applicable use tax, any federal luxury tax or any other taxes assessed on the purchase of the goods. The buyer is solely responsible for identifying and obtaining any necessary export, import, or other permit for the delivery of the goods and for determining whether the goods are subject to any export or import embargoes.

### Artspace not Responsible for Auction Submissions; No Representations or Warranties

Sellers and buyers agree that Artspace is not responsible for and does not make any representations or warranties (express or implied) as to the goods offered, including without limitation as to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, the accuracy of the description of the goods, the physical condition, size, quality, rarity, importance, medium, provenance, whether the goods are subject to export or import restrictions or embargoes, shipment or delivery, packing or handling, the ability of the buyer to pay, the ability of the seller to collect the purchase price, or any other representation or warranty of any kind or nature. Artspace is not responsible for any errors or failures to execute bids placed online, including, without limitation, errors or failures caused by (1) loss of connection to the internet or to the online bidding software by any party, (2) a breakdown or failure of the online bidding software, or (3) a breakdown or failure of any seller’s or buyer’s internet connection or computer or (4) any errors or omissions in connection with the bidding process.

To place a bid, enter the maximum amount you are willing to pay for the work. Artspace will accept a bid at the next increment, and save any excess amount as a maximum bid. If you are outbid, we will continue bid on your behalf up to your maximum bid.

### Bid Increments

Bidding increments increase at the following intervals:

* Below $400: $50
* Between $400 and $699: $100
* Between $700 and $1,499: $200
* Between $1,500 and $2,499: $300
* Between $2,500 and $4,999: $500
* Between $5,000 and $9,999: $1,000
* Between $10,000 and $19,999: $2,000
* Between $20,000 and $29,999: $3,000
* Between $30,000 and $49,999: $4,000
* Between $50,000 and $99,999: $5,000
* Above $100,000: $10,000

You will receive an email confirmation of your bid and when you are outbid.

If you are the winning bidder, you will be contacted 48 hours after of the close of the auction.

### Maximum Bidding

Every bid submitted is treated as a maximum bid. You should always bid the maximum you are willing to spend for a work, though this does not necessarily mean you will pay that price. As the auction unfolds, we will increase your bid by increments to ensure you remain the highest bidder. If the winning amount is less than your maximum bid, you will pay the current increment. If your maximum bid no longer exceeds the current bid, you will receive an outbid notification email, and have the option to bid again.

In the case of multiple bidders placing the same maximum bid, the first person to place the maximum amount takes precedence as the highest bid until another bidder exceeds the maximum amount.

### Buyer's Premium & Additional Charges

For Artspace Auctions winning bidders are charged a 15% Buyer's Premium on top of the hammer price. For Artspace Benefit Auctions, Buyer's Premiums are not applied. If they are, this will be clearly noted. Purchases made from all auctions, including benefit auctions, are subject to sales tax.

### Check Out

Winning bidders will be contacted within 48 hours to arrange shipping and to provide final price including commission, shipping, and taxes and duties when applicable. Promotion codes cannot be applied to auction works.

\* Price listed does not include buyer's premium (if applicable), sales tax, shipping, or handling fees.

FRAME DETAILS & ELEMENTS

  

### Frame

All our frames are manufactured in the USA, using eco-friendly & sustainably sourced engineered hardwood for durability and a uniform finish that is free of defects. Frames are available in Black or White Satin and Honey Pecan.

*   
    White Satin
*   
    Honey Pecan
*   
    Black Satin

### Mat

All prints are hinged to a conservation quality, acid-free and lignin-free Alpha Cellulose matboard, using an acid-free linen tape. The mat's surface paper is fade and bleed resistant and is attached to a conservation quality foam-core mounting board that will keep the work safe from deterioration over time. Artworks with a deckled or decorative edges will be floated on the matboard, with acrylic spacers to separate the art from the glazing. All mounting is fully reversible, without any potential damage to the art.

### Acrylic Glazing

All of our frames come with picture quality .090 mm plexiglass, which blocks 66% of UV to prevent color fading from exposure to light, keeping your art protected for years to come. It is now considered the industry standard for artists, museums and galleries throughout the world.

### Dimensions

For images up to 30" x 40"

* 1 1/4” wide, 3/4” deep, with a 2 1/2” wide mat.
* We generally leave 1/4” - 1/2” of paper showing around the image, to accommodate signatures and for visual appeal.

For sheet sizes larger than 30” x 40”

* Please contact an Artspace advisor for a custom quote.

  
If you have any questions about framing or care, please email  [email customer service service@artspace.com](mailto:service@artspace.com).
