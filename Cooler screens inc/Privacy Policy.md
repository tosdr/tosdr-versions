**PRIVACY POLICY**
==================

  
Effective Date: January 7, 2020.  
  
  
  

**1\. Introduction and Overview.**  
  
This Privacy Policy describes how Cooler Screens, Inc. (“Cooler Screens,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you as well as your rights and choices about such use and sharing, and applies to your interaction with any online service location and any coolers in any retail location that posts a link to this Privacy Policy or makes this Privacy Policy available to you, including our website at [www.coolerscreens.com](https://www.coolerscreens.com/) (**“Website”**) and our cooler display technologies (**“Smart Coolers”**) (collectively, the **“Service”**). This Privacy Policy does not apply to our information collection activities outside of the Service (unless otherwise stated below or at the time of collection).  
  
If you have any questions, please contact us as set out in the “Contact Us” section below.  
  
  
  
**2\. Information Collection.**  
  
**A. Information Collected through our Smart Coolers.**  
We work with retailers to deploy Smart Coolers in their stores. Our Smart Coolers use sensors and software to measure the size of their consumer audience. No videos or images are taken or stored. The software develops statistics concerning the environment where the particular Smart Cooler is located. We use those statistics for purposes of understanding consumer trends and purchase behavior, which may be used to inform advertising campaigns and product placement.  
  
Cooler Screens does not collect or retain any information that individually identifies consumers.  
  
**B. Information Provided through the Website.**  
We collect information you provide when you use the Website, including when you request a demo or contact us. The information we collect includes information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination). Some examples of information you provide include the following:

* **Contact Data**, including your first and last name, email address, postal address, and phone number.
* **Company Data**, including your company’s name and postal address, and your title.
* **Content**, including content within any messages you send to us (such as feedback and questions to customer support).

You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Website that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.  
  
**C. Information Collected Automatically through the Website.**  
We automatically collect information in connection with your use of the Website. Some examples of information we automatically collect include the following:

* **Website Use Data**, including data about the features you use, the pages you visit, any associated emails and advertisements you view, the time of day you browse, and your referring and exiting pages.
* **Device Connectivity and Configuration Data**, including data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and device identifiers such as IP address.

We use various current – and later – developed technologies to automatically collect information (“Tracking Technologies”), including the following:

* **Log Files**, which are files that record events that occur in connection with your use of the Website.
* **Cookies**, which are small data files stored on your device that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our website and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Website. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings.
* **Pixels** (also known as web beacons), which is code embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Website, and provide you with additional functionality.
