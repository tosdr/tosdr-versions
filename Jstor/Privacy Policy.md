ITHAKA provides this policy so that you can understand what [information we collect and use](#collection-and-use) based on which ITHAKA website you use and the specific ITHAKA service you engage, and the choices available to you regarding our use of, your access to, and how you can update such information in connection with the following services provided on ITHAKA’s Websites:

### Your rights under this policy

**Sharing personal information is your choice and you can opt out:** You can decide whether to provide personal information to us or organizations with which we conduct business as outlined in this policy. If you do not, you remain anonymous to us other than by association with an internet protocol address or other de-identified authentication mechanism. If you provide us with personal information, you may also later opt out of our use of your personal information by contacting us at [privacy@ithaka.org](mailto:privacy@ithaka.org) or by following the unsubscribe instructions, including in newsletter and marketing emails. We will also remove you and your personal information from our records or refrain from using your personal information in connection with certain services on request if you contact us with your request at [privacy@ithaka.org](mailto:privacy@ithaka.org). Please note that this may prevent you from accessing ITHAKA’s services, including JSTOR, your personal JSTOR account, Publisher Sales Service, and certain Artstor websites and services as described below.

**You may review or edit your information:** Upon request, ITHAKA will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information and allow you to delete or update your information to correct inaccuracies. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. You will need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as your name and email address and possible additional identifying information as a security precaution.

Please note, because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete or amend your information, residual copies of your information may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.

**We will retain and use your data only as long as is appropriate:** We will retain your information as long as you have not opted out and (i) as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services or (ii) as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We employ data retention policies to ensure that personal information is removed after provision of services has been terminated or if there has been prolonged account inactivity.

**You must be 16 or older:** ITHAKA does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If it is discovered that we have collected personal information from someone under 16 we promptly will delete that information. **Please note:** As stated above, ITHAKA does not collect personal information unless you choose to share it. Users under 16 may use the ITHAKA Websites directly on the internet and/or through their institution account as long as they do not take steps to share their personal information.

**You consent to this policy only when you choose to share personal information with ITHAKA:** By choosing to engage with the ITHAKA Websites and ITHAKA Services in the ways described in this policy, you consent to the collection and use, as described below, of the information you provide to us (unless or until you opt out).  
We will notify you of updates to this policy that affect use of your personal information: In order to reflect changes to our information practices, we may update this privacy policy from time to time. However, if we make any change in how we use the personal information you have already provided, we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account). We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices and reach out to [privacy@ithaka.org](mailto:privacy@ithaka.org) with any questions.

**We employ practices to hold your information securely:** We protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure through the use of passwords, physical security measures, managerial measures, and (in connection with credit card information for order sales through JPASS, the Publisher Sales Service, Individual Access, and for purchase of ITHAKA- branded merchandise) encryption through our third party service providers. We adhere to SOC 2 information security standards. SOC 2 is a technical audit that requires organizations to establish strict information security policies and procedures to protect customer data. ITHAKA undergoes annual external audits to ensure ongoing compliance with the physical, administrative, and technical safeguards required under the SOC 2 framework. For more details, please see our [SOC 3 Report](http://about.jstor.org/ithaka-soc3-report).

We nonetheless recognize that third parties may obtain access to information through unlawful actions, and thus do not promise that your information always will remain private, despite our efforts and the importance we place on maintaining your privacy. In addition, we do not claim any responsibility for information collected by or from websites linking to or from ITHAKA Websites. In the event that we discover or are notified of a security breach where personal information is at risk, we will notify you electronically if we have your email address and if you have not opted out of such communications.

**We seek to enforce this policy and will address complaints appropriately:** We periodically verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with applicable laws, including but not limited to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). If you have any concerns about the application of this policy, please [contact us](#contact) so we may investigate. We will attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this policy. However, if you have an unresolved privacy or data concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request) or, for individuals subject to the GDPR, you may seek an administrative or judicial remedy or to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority where you reside, where you work, or where the alleged infringement took place.
