Thank you for visiting BSF!  We hope you will find our websites and applications informative and easy to use.

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.

Bible Study Fellowship, a California not-for-profit corporation, and or its affiliates (collectively, “BSF”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) are pleased to provide you (also referred to herein as “I”) access to certain BSF applications, software, mobile applications, social media profiles, messaging applications, video conferencing services, in-person services, software enabled services, interfaces, tools, and payment platforms, which may include BSF classes or groups (the “BSF Groups”), BSF Online, Word in the City, WordGo, the WordGo App, and the BSF App (collectively, the “BSF Applications”), whether or not provided on or through the BSF websites, subject to your agreement to comply with these terms and conditions (the “Agreement”).

BY ACCESSING OR USING THE BSF APPLICATIONS OR BSF MATERIALS (DEFINED BELOW), YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT AS UPDATED FROM TIME TO TIME.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ARE UNWILLING TO ABIDE BY ANY TERM OR CONDITION, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE BSF APPLICATIONS.  ACCORDINGLY, YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR USE OF THE BSF APPLICATIONS CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND GIVES RISE TO A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN BSF AND YOU GOVERNING YOUR USE OF THE BSF APPLICATIONS.  BY ACCESSING OR USING THE BSF APPLICATIONS, YOU HEREBY AGREE AND REPRESENT AS FOLLOWS:

**1: I Understand that BSF May Change this Agreement.**

BSF reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, update, add, or delete portions of this Agreement at any time and without any further notice to you.  You, however, may not amend this Agreement unless the amendment is in writing and signed by both you and BSF.

It is your responsibility to regularly check for changes to this Agreement and to review such changes at https://www.mybsf.org/terms-of-use.  All changes to this Agreement are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the BSF Applications thereafter.  Any changes to the dispute resolution provisions, however, will not apply to any dispute for which the parties have notice before the date the new version of this Agreement is posted.

Your continued access or use of the BSF Applications after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Agreement.  Your written approval is not a prerequisite to the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, and no solicitation of such written approval by or on behalf of BSF shall be construed as an inference to the contrary.

**2: I Understand that this Agreement is Effective Until Terminated.**

This Agreement is effective until terminated.  We can terminate your access to the BSF Applications at any time, with or without notice.  Your rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically without notice from BSF if you fail to comply with any of the terms, conditions, or guidelines of this Agreement.  We may also remove any User Content (as defined below) that you post without cause and without notice to you.  Provisions of this Agreement, however, that require or contemplate performance after the termination of this Agreement shall survive and be enforceable after the termination of this Agreement.

You may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to BSF of your decision to terminate and by ceasing to use the BSF Applications, including your user account.  Your decision to terminate the Agreement will be effective 30 days after we receive your written notice.  BSF contact information is provided at the end of this Agreement.

Upon the termination of this Agreement, you shall cease all use of the BSF Applications.  In the event that your rights to use the BSF Applications are terminated, you may immediately lose access to any information that may be on our systems, including in your user account.

**3: I Understand that BSF May Change the BSF Applications.**

BSF reserves the right, in its sole discretion, without notice to you, at any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to: (a) modify, suspend, terminate, withdraw, or discontinue all or any part of the BSF Applications without compensation to you, including, but not limited to (i) restricting the time all or any part of the BSF Applications that is available, (ii) restricting the amount of permitted use of all or any part of the BSF Applications, and (iii) restricting or terminating any user’s right to use all or any part of the BSF Applications, with or without notice; (b) charge fees in connection with the use of all or any part of the BSF Applications; (c) modify or waive any fees charged in connection with all or any part of the BSF Applications; or (d) offer opportunities to some or all users of all or any part of the BSF Applications.  Any new features or updated content or applications that we make available as a part of the BSF Applications will be subject to this Agreement.  You agree that BSF will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of all or any part of the BSF Applications, in whole or in part, or of any service, content, or feature offered through the BSF Applications.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS TO THE BSF APPLICATIONS, BSF CONTENT, BSF MARKS, OR ANY OTHER BSF PROPERTY EXCEPT AS INDICATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  BSF TAKES THE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS, VERY SERIOUSLY.  BSF WILL TERMINATE YOUR ACCESS TO, OR USE OF, ALL OR ANY PART OF THE BSF APPLICATIONS, WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, IF YOU INFRINGE OR MISAPPROPRIATE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING COPYRIGHTS, OF BSF OR OTHERS.

**5: I Understand that I have Only a Limited Right to Use the BSF Applications.**

H. Disputes, Forum, and Governing Law:

Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, this Agreement, all matters relating to the BSF Applications and BSF Content, and any disputes, claims, suits, causes of action, or proceedings arising out of this Agreement, the BSF Applications or the BSF Content, including any disputes, claims, suits, or causes of action concerning the interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination of this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the United States of America and the State of Texas, United States of America, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rules.  If the foregoing choice of law provision is prohibited by applicable law, then this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the country where the services associated with the BSF Applications are primarily being provided.

Except as prohibited by law or provided below regarding suits we may initiate against you, any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to this Agreement, the BSF Applications or BSF Content will be instituted exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Bexar County, Texas.  We retain the right to bring suit against you for any breach of this Agreement in your country of residence or any other relevant country.  You hereby waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.  If the foregoing venue provision is prohibited by applicable law, then this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the country where the services associated with the BSF Applications are primarily being provided.

In addition, you agree that BSF may, at its sole discretion, or when the foregoing provisions are prohibited by law, require you to submit any disputes, claims, suits, or causes of action relating to this Agreement, the BSF Applications or BSF Content, including any disputes, claims, suits, or causes of action concerning the interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination of this Agreement, to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the then-effective International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution Rules for Non Administered Arbitration.  If an arbitration is commenced pursuant to this paragraph, that arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s)  may be entered and enforced against you by any court of competent jurisdiction.  The place of the arbitration shall be San Antonio, TX.
