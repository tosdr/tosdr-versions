All Privacy and Cookie Notices will be approved by the Privacy Officer prior to publication on any iSchoolConnect external website.

4.2 Data Use
------------

### 4.2.1 Data Processing

iSchoolConnect uses the Personal Data of its Data Subjects for the following broad purposes:

* To provide services to iSchoolConnect customers.
* The ongoing administration and management of customer services

The use of a Data Subject’s information should always be considered from their perspective and whether the use will be within their expectations or if they are likely to object.

iSchoolConnect will process Personal Data in accordance with all applicable laws and applicable contractual obligations. More specifically, iSchoolConnect will not process Personal Data unless at least one of the following requirements are met:

* Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the Data Subject prior to entering into a contract.
* Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject.
* Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person.
* Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Data Controller.
* Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Data Controller or by a third party (except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject, in particular where the Data Subject is a child).

There are some circumstances in which Personal Data may be further processed for purposes that go beyond the original purpose for which the Personal Data was collected. When deciding the compatibility of the new reason for Processing, guidance and approval must be obtained from the Privacy Officer before any such Processing may commence.

In any circumstance where Consent has not been gained for the specific Processing in question, iSchoolConnect will address the following additional conditions to determine the fairness and transparency of any Processing beyond the original purpose for which the Personal Data was collected:

* Any link between the purpose for which the Personal Data was collected and the reasons for intended further Processing.
* The context in which the Personal Data has been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between Data Subject and the Data Controller.
* The nature of the Personal Data, in particular whether Special Categories of Data are being Processed, or whether Personal Data related to criminal convictions and offences are being processed.
* The possible consequences of the intended further Processing for the Data Subject.
* The existence of appropriate safeguards pertaining to further Processing, which may include Encryption, Anonymization or Pseudonymisation.

### 4.2.2 Special Categories of Data

iSchoolConnect will only Process Special Categories of Data (also known as sensitive data where the Data Subject expressly consents to such Processing or where one of the following conditions apply:

* The Processing relates to Personal Data which has already been made public by the Data Subject.

* The Processing is specifically authorised or required by law.
* The Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person where the Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.

### 4.2.3 Children’s Data

Children are unable to Consent to the Processing of Personal Data for information society services. Consent must be sought from the person who holds parental responsibility over the child. However, it should be noted that where Processing is lawful under other grounds, as mentioned above in section 4.4.2, Consent need not be obtained from the child or the holder of parental responsibility.

Should iSchoolConnect foresee a business need for obtaining parental consent for information society services offered directly to a child, guidance and approval must be obtained from the Privacy Officer before any Processing of a child’s Personal Data may commence.

### 4.2.4 Data Quality

iSchoolConnect will adopt all necessary measures to ensure that the Personal Data it collects and Processes is complete and accurate in the first instance, and is updated to reflect the current situation of the Data Subject.

* The measures adopted by iSchoolConnect to ensure data quality include: Correcting Personal Data known to be incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous, misleading or outdated, even if the Data Subject does not request rectification.
* Keeping Personal Data only for the period necessary to satisfy the permitted uses or applicable statutory retention period.
* The removal of Personal Data if in violation of any of the Data Protection principles or if the Personal Data is no longer required.
* Restriction, rather than deletion of Personal Data, insofar as:
    * A law prohibits erasure.
    * Erasure would impair legitimate interests of the Data Subject.
    * The Data Subject disputes that their Personal Data is correct and it cannot be clearly ascertained whether their information is correct or incorrect.

### 4.2.5 Digital Marketing

As a rule, iSchoolConnect will not send promotional or direct marketing material to an iSchoolConnect Data Subject through digital channels such as mobile phones, SMS texting, WhatsApp messaging, email and the Internet, without first obtaining their Consent. iSchoolConnect wishing to carry out a digital marketing campaign without obtaining prior Consent from the Data Subject must first have it approved by the Privacy Officer.

Where Personal Data Processing is approved for digital marketing purposes, the Data Subject must be informed at the point of first Data Subject that they have the right to object, at any stage, to having their data Processed for such purposes. If the Data Subject puts forward an objection, digital marketing related Processing of their Personal Data must cease immediately and their details should be kept on a suppression list with a record of their opt-out decision, rather than being completely deleted.

It should be noted that where digital marketing is carried out in a ‘business to business’ context, there is no legal requirement to obtain an indication of Consent to carry out digital marketing to individuals provided that they are given the opportunity to opt-out.

### 4.2.6 Data Retention

To ensure fair Processing, Personal Data will not be retained by iSchoolConnect for longer than necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected, or for which it was further processed.

The length of time for which iSchoolConnect needs to retain Personal Data will be determined and set out in the Backup and Data Retention policy. This takes into account the legal and contractual requirements, both minimum and maximum, that influence the retention periods set forth in the schedule. All Personal Data should be deleted or destroyed as soon as possible where it has been confirmed that there is no longer a need to retain it.

### 4.2.7 Data Protection

* Data erasure.

If an individual makes a request relating to any of the rights listed above, iSchoolConnect will consider each such request in accordance with all applicable Data Protection laws and regulations.

Data Subjects are entitled to obtain, based upon a request made in writing to the Privacy Officer and upon successful verification of their identity, the following information about their own Personal Data:

* The purposes of the collection, Processing, use and storage of their Personal Data.
* The source(s) of the Personal Data, if it was not obtained from the Data Subject;

A response to each request will be provided within 30 days of the receipt of the written request from the Data Subject. Appropriate verification must confirm that the requestor is the Data Subject or their authorised legal representative. Data Subjects shall have the right to require iSchoolConnect to correct or supplement erroneous, misleading, outdated, or incomplete Personal Data.

If iSchoolConnect cannot respond fully to the request within 30 days, the Privacy Officer shall nevertheless provide the following information to the Data Subject, or their authorised legal representative within the specified time:

* An acknowledgement of receipt of the request.
* Any information located to date.
* Details of any requested information or modifications which will be provided to the Data Subject, the reason(s) for the refusal, and any procedures available for appealing the decision.
* An estimated date by which any remaining responses will be provided.
* An estimate of any costs to be paid by the Data Subject (e.g. where the request is excessive in nature).
* The name and Data Subject information of the iSchoolConnect individual who the Data Subject should contact for follow up.

It should be noted that situations may arise where providing the information requested by a Data Subject would disclose Personal Data about another individual. In such cases, information must be redacted or withheld as may be necessary or appropriate to protect that person’s rights.

### 4.2.9 Law Enforcement Requests & Disclosures

In certain circumstances, it is permitted that Personal Data be shared without the knowledge or Consent of a Data Subject. This is the case where the disclosure of the Personal Data is necessary for any of the following purposes:

* The prevention or detection of crime.
* The apprehension or prosecution of offenders.
* The assessment or collection of a tax or duty.
* By the order of a court or by any rule of law.

If iSchoolConnect processes Personal Data for one of these purposes, then it may apply an exception to the Processing rules outlined in this policy but only to the extent that not doing so would be likely to prejudice the case in question.

### 4.2.10 Data Protection Training

All iSchoolConnect employees that have access to Personal Data will have their responsibilities under this policy outlined to them as part of their staff induction training. In addition, iSchoolConnect will provide regular Data Protection training and procedural guidance for their staff. The training and procedural guidance set forth will consist of, at a minimum, the following elements:

* The Data Protection Principles set forth in this document
* Each employee’s duty to use and permit the use of Personal Data only by authorised persons and for authorised purposes.
* The need for, and proper use of, the forms and procedures adopted to implement this policy.
* The correct use of passwords, security tokens and other access mechanisms.
* The importance of limiting access to Personal Data, such as by using password protected screen savers and logging out when systems are not being attended by an authorised person.

* The need to obtain appropriate authorisation and utilise appropriate safeguards for all transfers of Personal Data outside of the internal network and physical office premises.
* Proper disposal of Personal Data by using secure shredding facilities.
* Any special risks associated with particular departmental activities or duties.

### 4.2.11 Transfers between iSchoolConnect Entities

For iSchoolConnect to carry out its operations effectively across its various entities, there may be occasions when it is necessary to transfer Personal Data from one iSchoolConnect entity to another, or to allow access to the Personal Data from an overseas location. Should this occur, the iSchoolConnect entities sending the Personal Data remains responsible for ensuring protection for that Personal Data.

### 4.2.12 Transfers to Third Parties

iSchoolConnect will only transfer Personal Data to, or allow access by, third parties when it is assured that the information will be processed legitimately and protected appropriately by the recipient. Where third party Processing takes place, iSchoolConnect will first identify if, under applicable law, the third party is considered a Data Controller or a Data Processor of the Personal Data being transferred.

Where the third party is deemed to be a Data Controller, iSchoolConnect will enter into, in cooperation with the Privacy Officer, an appropriate agreement with the Controller to clarify each party’s responsibilities in respect to the Personal Data transferred.

Where the third party is deemed to be a Data Processor, iSchoolConnect will enter into, in cooperation with the Privacy Officer, an adequate Processing agreement with the Data Processor. The agreement must require the Data Processor to protect the Personal Data from further disclosure and to only Process Personal Data in compliance with iSchoolConnect instructions. In addition, the agreement will require the Data Processor to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the Personal Data as well as procedures for providing notification of Personal Data Breaches.

When iSchoolConnect is outsourcing services to a third party (including Cloud Computing services), they will identify whether the third party will Process Personal Data on its behalf and whether the outsourcing will entail any Third Country transfers of Personal Data.

The Privacy Officer shall conduct regular audits of Processing of Personal Data performed by third parties, especially in respect of technical and organisational measures they have in place. Any major deficiencies identified will be reported to and monitored by iSchoolConnect’s management.

### 4.2.13 Complaints Handling

Data Subjects with a complaint about the Processing of their Personal Data, should put forward the matter in writing to the Privacy Officer. An investigation of the complaint will be carried out to the extent that is appropriate based on the merits of the specific case. The Privacy Officer will inform the Data Subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period.

If the issue cannot be resolved through consultation between the Data Subject and the Privacy Officer, then the Data Subject may, at their option, seek redress through mediation, binding arbitration, litigation, or via complaint to the Data Protection Authority within the applicable jurisdiction
