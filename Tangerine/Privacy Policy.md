============

1. English
2. French

**A word about your privacy**

We respect your privacy. Not only do we respect it, but we also protect it. We only share your personal information in circumstances that we will describe in this Code and that align with our privacy principles. We have provided this document to explain our privacy principles and procedures. This Code reflects both the importance of the issue and the legal and regulatory requirements for privacy protection. If you want more information regarding our privacy principles and procedures, please read on.

To request access to, or correction of, your personal information, or to make other inquiries regarding your personal information, you may write our Global Privacy Officer at [**theprivacyofficer@tangerine.ca**](mailto:theprivacyofficer@tangerine.ca) or by mail to:

### Introduction

Tangerine Bank (“Tangerine” or “we”) is committed to keeping personal information of our Clients and prospective Clients (“you” or “your” personal information) accurate, confidential, and secure. The Tangerine Privacy Code reflects this commitment.

This Privacy Code is based on the _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_ (PIPEDA). It describes how Tangerine complies with the principles of PIPEDA. A copy of PIPEDA is available at [**priv.gc.ca**](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/).

### The scope of this Privacy Code

This Privacy Code describes the principles Tangerine will use to protect the personal information in its possession or control. This Privacy Code does not apply to information about business Clients who carry on business as corporations, partnerships or other forms of association. We do, however, protect the confidentiality of such information in accordance with the law and our policies. This Privacy Code applies to any personal information that we collect about individual owners of sole proprietorships or personal information about officers, directors, employees or partners of a business Client.

### Personal information

“Personal information” generally means any information that can be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to identify an individual. This includes information such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, or any other contact details. It may also include other types of more technical information, but only when this information can identify you as an individual, such as your IP address, the device you use to access our website or app and details on your use of our website or app. Information that is anonymized and can’t be associated with an identifiable individual is not considered to be personal information.

SECTION 1
---------

### Principle – Tangerine’s accountability

We are accountable for all personal information in our possession or control, including any personal information transferred to third parties for processing. We have established procedures to comply with this Privacy Code and have designated one or more persons to be accountable for compliance.

1. Our Global Privacy Officer is responsible for protecting the privacy of our Clients’ personal information and our compliance with this Privacy Code.
2. We are also accountable for personal information that has been transferred to a third party for processing (for example, cheque clearing services). Our policies for safeguarding personal information transferred to third parties are set out in **[Section 7.4](#new-7-4)** of this Privacy Code.
3. To ensure compliance with the principles of this Privacy Code, we:
    * have established procedures to protect personal information;
    * have established procedures to receive and respond to questions and complaints;
    * published this Privacy Code; and
    * have trained our staff to understand and follow our privacy procedures.

SECTION 2

### Principle – Identifying the purposes of collecting personal information

We will identify the purposes of collecting personal information.

1. We take care to explain purposes which are not as obvious as others. While the purposes for collecting a name or address may be obvious and do not need to be explained, the purposes for collecting other information may not be as self-evident.
2. We will clearly identify the purpose for which we are collecting your personal information either through writing, verbally when we are speaking with you or through any other means we use to communicate with you. There are some cases where we are not required to obtain your consent (See **[Section 3](#new-3-0)** and **[Section 5.1](#new-5-1)** for details).
3. You can ask for information about the purposes for which we collect personal information when you phone us or write to our Global Privacy Officer.
4. In addition to any purposes identified to you before or at the time of collection, we will collect personal information (which may include credit, employment and other financially related information) for the following purposes:
    * to help identify you;
    * to determine your suitability or eligibility for our products or services;
    * to set up and manage Tangerine’s products and services;
    * to offer, set up and manage products and services, including those of our affiliates or trusted business partners;
    * to provide ongoing service; and
    * to meet legal and regulatory requirements, such as requirements under the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and credit reporting requirements.

Examples of additional purposes for which we may collect, disclose or use your personal information:

**b**. your date of birth and other identifying information may be collected and used to verify your identity, and to protect you and Tangerine from error or fraud. We may also collect and use personal information obtained from credit reporting agencies and other financial institutions in order to help verify your identity when you are a new Client;

**c**. a Social Insurance Number (SIN) is collected because the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) and other national or international regulations related to the taxing of nationals require it for income tax reporting. In addition, a SIN may be used to match credit bureau information or protect you and Tangerine from reporting errors or fraud. Providing your SIN for these identity verification purposes is optional. To withdraw your consent for the use of your SIN for identity verification purposes, you may contact us as set out below; see [**Section 3.5**](#new-3-5) and [**Section 3.6**](#new-3-6);

**d**. personal information is exchanged with credit reporting agencies, credit insurers (including health information), and other financial institutions, to maintain the integrity of the credit-granting process and to determine eligibility for financial products and services including creditor insurance products. The credit reporting agencies that provide your credit information to us are Equifax Canada Inc. (Equifax.ca) and TransUnion Canada Inc. (transunion.ca). You can contact them to access, rectify or obtain a copy of your credit report;

**e**. personal information, including transaction details for any product or service offered by Tangerine, is used by us to determine your eligibility for products and services or to identify products or services that may be of interest to you, and we will use your contact and other information to notify you of such products including by website, mail (including statement inserts), email, phone, SMS text messages, our Mobile Banking app or any other electronic method offered by Tangerine and used by you. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications, you can opt out as described in [**Section 3.6**](#new-3-6);

**f.** when you use our Mobile Banking app, we may ask you for certain images, including of:

**·** Your identification document(s) and a “selfie” to validate identity and prevent fraud as described in our [Digital ID Verification Terms](https://www.tangerine.ca/en/legal/digital-id-terms)

**·** Other documents to validate identity and prevent fraud

**·** The front and back of cheques to deposit cheques

**g**. subject to [**Section 7.4**](#new-7-4), personal information may be disclosed to investors or potential investors, lenders and government guarantors in order for us to process, fund and securitize your mortgage;

**h**. personal information may be collected, used and disclosed to investigate specific transactions or patterns of transactions for the purpose of detecting unauthorized, fraudulent or other illegal activities;

**i**. personal information may be collected and used to ensure that your instructions can be properly verified and to prevent errors;

**j**. personal information may be collected, used and disclosed to investigate your complaints;

**k**. should you open an Account to be operated on behalf of a third party, personal information of that third party will be collected from you in accordance with Anti-Money Laundering legislation;

**l**. we may share personal information with members of the Scotiabank group of companies and other service providers who provide operational, administrative and support services on our behalf, to meet legal and regulatory obligations, for fraud prevention purposes, and to perform analytics;

**m**. members of the Scotiabank group of companies and our service providers may be located outside of your province of residence or outside of Canada, and your personal information may be accessed or processed in the United States or other jurisdictions. For a list of Scotiabank’s principal affiliates and subsidiaries enterprise-wide, please refer to the most recent Annual Report.

**n**. we may share your personal information with other members of the Scotiabank group of companies and our service providers so that they may contact you for the purposes of marketing, including telemarketing, or to help you manage your credit responsibly. You can withdraw your consent to the disclosure of your personal information to other Scotiabank companies for marketing at any time; see [**Section 3.5**](#new-3-5) and [**Section 3.6**](#new-3-6);

**o**. personal information may be collected, used and disclosed for the purpose of legal or regulatory requirements;

**p**. personal information may be collected, used and disclosed if you participate in a contest, survey or promotion to administer your participation in the contest or promotion and as otherwise described to you when you enter. Information obtained through our surveys is used in an aggregated form, unless you provide us with your consent. We use this information to help us understand our Clients and to improve our products and services;

**q**. personal information about a joint Account and any transactions on that Account may be disclosed to any Account holder; and

**r**. personal information may be disclosed to a representative (such as a legal guardian, Power of Attorney, estate representative or lawyer) where reasonably necessary to administer the estate.

**s.** The way we analyze your personal information may involve automated decisions. This involves processing your personal information using software that can evaluate your personal circumstances and other factors to address risks or outcomes. We may use this method to make decisions about you relating to credit checks, identity and address checks, monitoring your Account(s) for fraud or other financial crime, or for other reasons that we’ll disclose to you. We may use automated decision making if it’s necessary for us to provide you with a particular product (for example, we may use it to decide on the types of services that are suitable for you), to prevent fraud or financial crime, or if it’s reasonable to ensure that we’re treating our Clients fairly.

**t.** Tangerine is present on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and X (Twitter). When you interact with our social media accounts, for example, if you “like” our page or make comments, we may collect certain information about you, such as any information you may provide in the comments you publish on our account page and the direct messages you send us. The information we collect depends on what these social media platforms share with us based on the privacy settings you have selected. We suggest you consult the privacy policies of these social media platforms to learn more.

SECTION 3
---------

### Principle – Obtaining consent

We will collect, use or disclose personal information without your consent only in limited circumstances as permitted by law.

Subject to certain legal, regulatory and contractual obligations and reasonable notice, an individual can refuse or withdraw their consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information about them at any time. In certain instances, that means we may not be able to offer you certain products and services.

1. Generally, we will seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the time of collection. In some circumstances, we may identify a new purpose and seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected.
2. We will explain to you in plain language how personal information will be used or disclosed before requesting your consent.
3. Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information can be expressed, implied, or given through your authorized representative.
    * You can express consent verbally, such as when information is collected over the telephone, in writing, such as when completing and signing an application, or electronically, such as when applying online.
    * Your consent can be implied, for example, by using a Tangerine product or service.
    * You can also give consent through an authorized representative, such as a legal guardian or a person with a Power of Attorney. This may be necessary, for example, when we cannot obtain express consent from a minor, or an individual who is seriously ill.
4. We may collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge and consent only in limited circumstances as permitted by law. For example:
    * We may collect, use and disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent if it is clearly in your best interest to do so and consent cannot be sought in a timely manner. An example of such a circumstance is when an individual is seriously ill.
    * Tangerine may collect, use and disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent in accordance with law or upon the lawful request of a government institution or part of a government institution. An example would be when a government institution lawfully requests the information for the enforcement of federal or provincial Canadian law or laws of a foreign jurisdiction.
5. You can refuse to consent to our collection, use or disclosure of personal information, or you may withdraw your consent to our further collection, use or disclosure of your personal information at any time by giving us reasonable notice, subject to limited exceptions. This includes withdrawing your consent for the use of your SIN for identity verification purposes.
    * We will inform you of the consequences of refusing or withdrawing consent. Refusing or withdrawing consent for Tangerine to collect, use or disclose personal information could mean that we cannot provide you with a product and/or service. For example, if you do not allow us to obtain a credit report, we may not be able to lend money to you.
    * We may have legal, regulatory or contractual obligations to collect, use or disclose certain of your personal information, in which case you may not withdraw your consent. For example, during the term of a loan, you may not withdraw your consent to our ongoing collection, use or disclosure of your personal information in connection with the loan you have with us or have guaranteed.
    * We will not unreasonably withhold products, services or information from individuals who refuse to give consent or who withdraw consent.
    * Tangerine is required by law to collect certain types of personal information in order to verify your identity. If you do not allow us to collect and use this information, or if you later attempt to withdraw your consent, we may not be able to open or maintain an Account for you.
    * Withdrawal of consent is not permitted in relation to a credit product where we must collect and report information after credit has been granted. This is to maintain the integrity of the credit reporting system.
    * We will act on your instructions as quickly as possible but there may be certain uses of your information that we may not be able to stop immediately.
6. You can opt out and withdraw consent.
    * If you wish to withdraw your consent or update your marketing communication preferences, contact us toll-free at **[1-888-826-4374](tel:+18888264374)**.
    * To opt out of email communications, click on the “unsubscribe” link included in each of our communications.
    * To opt out of receiving SMS text messages, respond to any message by texting “STOP”.
    * To opt out of the sharing of your personal information with trusted partners, contact us using the contact information set out above.
    * To opt out of direct mail and phone marketing communications, contact us using the contact information set out above.

SECTION 4
---------

### Principle – Limits on the collection of personal information

Tangerine limits the amount and type of personal information it collects. We will collect personal information only for purposes that have been already identified to you or as permitted by law.

1. We will only collect the amount and type of information needed for the purposes documented by us and identified to you.
2. We will collect personal information about you primarily from you. Except as permitted by law, Tangerine will only collect personal information from external sources if you have consented to such collection (for example, a Refer-a-Friend Program).

SECTION 5
---------

### Principle – Limits on using, disclosing and keeping personal information

We will use or disclose personal information only for the reasons it was collected, unless consent is given to use or disclose it for another purpose. Under certain exceptional circumstances, we may have a legal duty or right to disclose personal information without your knowledge or consent.

We will keep personal information only as long as necessary for the identified purposes.

1. We may disclose personal information without consent when required or permitted by law. Examples of such disclosure include:
    * subpoenas, search warrants and other court and government orders;
    * debt collection or demands from other parties who have a legal right to personal information; and
    * disclosure of personal information to a lawyer (or, in Quebec, a notary or an advocate) who represents Tangerine to protect Tangerine’s interests.
2. In any of the circumstances referred to above, we will protect your interests by making sure that:
    * orders or demands appear to comply with the laws under which they were issued;
    * when permitted by law, we may notify you that an order or demand has been received.
3. We will collect health records only for specific purposes explained to you, such as establishing the effective date of a Power of Attorney or for creditor insurance purposes, as insurance providers require this personal information to assess insurance risk and to establish and administer the insurance coverage.
4. In the event we provide personal information to a third party service provider for processing located in a foreign jurisdiction, we will be bound by the laws and regulations of that jurisdiction and may disclose personal information in accordance with those laws and regulations.
5. We will destroy, erase or make anonymous any personal information no longer needed for its identified purposes or for legal requirements, in accordance with our records retention policies.
6. When you fill out forms and applications online or in our Mobile Banking app, we may save your progress as a draft for up to 30 days. Where possible, this means that if you can’t complete the form or need to switch devices, you don’t need to start over the next time you open the form. After that period, the information you entered will be deleted.  
    We may share information in accordance with your requests or as you otherwise consent. In some cases, your consent may be “implied”, meaning that your agreement is assumed based on your action or inaction at the point of processing your personal data. You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information as outlined in Section 3.5 and 3.6 above.

SECTION 6

### Principle – Keeping personal information accurate

We will keep the personal information in our possession or control accurate and complete based on the most recent information available to us. From time to time, Tangerine may contact you to ask you to confirm your contact information and your marketing communication preferences.

You may challenge the accuracy and completeness of your personal information and have it amended as appropriate.

1. We will make reasonable efforts to minimize the possibility of using inaccurate, incomplete or outdated personal information to make a decision about you.
2. We will make reasonable efforts to keep personal information in our possession and control accurate and current if the information is used on an ongoing basis.
3. We will rely on you to keep your personal information accurate, complete and current. If you demonstrate to us that personal information relating to you is inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date, we will revise or delete the personal information. If necessary, we will disclose the revised personal information to any third parties to whom we had disclosed wrong or outdated information in order to permit them to revise their records.
4. If we do not agree to revise the personal information as requested by you, you may challenge our decision. We will make a record of this challenge, and, if necessary, disclose the challenge by you to any third parties to whom we have disclosed the personal information.

### Principle – Safeguarding personal information

We will protect personal information with safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.

* electronic security, such as passwords, personal identification numbers and encryption.

4\. We may transfer personal information to third parties for processing. We will require these third parties to safeguard all personal information in a way that is consistent with our principles and as required by law. When we contract with third parties, they are given only the information necessary to perform the services as set out in the contract. The third parties are prohibited from storing, analyzing or using the personal information transferred by Tangerine for any other purpose. The third parties are required to protect personal information transferred by Tangerine in a manner that is consistent with our privacy principles.

La Banque Tangerine (« Tangerine » ou « nous ») tient à préserver l’exactitude, la confidentialité et la sécurité des renseignements personnels de ses clients actuels et éventuels (« vous » ou « vos » renseignements personnels). La Politique de confidentialité de Tangerine témoigne de cette volonté.

La présente Politique de confidentialité est établie d’après la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et les documents électroniques (LPRPDE). Elle décrit la façon dont Tangerine respecte les principes de la LPRPDE. Une copie de la LPRPDE est disponible à l’adresse [**priv.gc.ca**](https://www.priv.gc.ca/fr/).

### Portée de la présente Politique de confidentialité

La présente Politique de confidentialité décrit les principes auxquels souscrit Tangerine pour protéger les renseignements personnels en sa possession ou sous son contrôle.

Toutefois, nous protégeons la confidentialité de ces renseignements conformément à la loi et à nos politiques.

### Principe - Explication de l’usage prévu des renseignements personnels recueillis

Nous vous informerons des fins auxquelles vos renseignements personnels sont utilisés.

1. Nous prendrons soin d’expliquer tous les usages, y compris ceux qu’on ne saurait soupçonner. Si les raisons pour lesquelles on demande le nom et l’adresse de la personne sont bien évidentes, il n’en va pas forcément de même pour la collecte d’autres renseignements personnels.
2. Nous indiquerons clairement l’usage prévu des renseignements personnels que nous recueillons auprès de vous par écrit, de vive voix, lorsque nous vous parlons, ou encore par un autre des moyens que nous utilisons pour communiquer avec vous. Il n’est pas toujours nécessaire que nous obtenions votre consentement (se reporter à [**l’article 3**](#new-3-0) ou au **[paragraphe 5.1](#new-5-1)** pour de plus amples détails).
3. Vous pouvez demander l’usage prévu des renseignements personnels recueillis lorsque vous communiquez avec nous par téléphone ou que vous écrivez à notre responsable mondial de la protection de la vie privée.
4. En sus des usages mentionnés auparavant ou au moment de la collecte de renseignements, nous recueillerons des renseignements personnels aux fins suivantes (ce qui peut comprendre des renseignements sur votre solvabilité, votre emploi et d’autres renseignements financiers connexes) :
    * pour nous aider à vous identifier;
    * pour déterminer si nos produits ou services vous conviennent ou si vous y êtes admissible;

Nous pourrions recourir à des processus décisionnels automatisés pour vous fournir un produit particulier (par exemple, pour établir les types de services qui vous conviennent), pour prévenir la fraude ou les crimes financiers, ou pour nous assurer d’offrir un service équitable à nos clients.

### Principe – Obtenir un consentement

Nous recueillerons, utiliserons ou communiquerons des renseignements personnels sans votre consentement uniquement dans les circonstances restreintes permises par la loi.  
  
Sous réserve de certaines obligations juridiques, réglementaires et contractuelles et sur remise d’un avis raisonnable, une personne peut, à tout moment, refuser que des renseignements personnels à son sujet soient recueillis, utilisés ou communiqués, ou retirer son consentement à ces fins. Dans certains cas, cela signifie que nous pourrions ne plus être en mesure de vous offrir certains produits et services.

1. En règle générale, nous obtiendrons le consentement de la personne à l’utilisation et à la communication de renseignements personnels lors de leur collecte. Dans certains cas, nous pourrions déceler de nouvelles façons d’utiliser et de communiquer vos renseignements personnels après leur collecte et nous obtiendrons alors votre consentement à leur utilisation et communication.
2. Avant de demander votre consentement, nous vous expliquerons, dans un langage clair et simple, la façon dont nous entendons utiliser ou divulguer les renseignements personnels.
3. Le consentement à la collecte, à l’utilisation et à la communication de renseignements personnels peut être explicite, implicite ou fourni par l’entremise d’un représentant autorisé.
    * Vous pouvez exprimer votre consentement de vive voix, comme, lorsque les renseignements sont recueillis au téléphone, par écrit, comme lorsque vous remplissez et signez une demande, ou par voie électronique, comme lorsque vous présentez une demande en ligne.
    * Vous pouvez exprimer votre consentement de façon implicite, par exemple en utilisant un produit ou service de Tangerine.
    * Vous pouvez également donner votre consentement par l’entremise d’un représentant autorisé, comme un tuteur légal ou un fondé de pouvoir. Ce type de consentement peut se révéler nécessaire lorsque, par exemple, nous ne pouvons obtenir le consentement explicite d’une personne mineure ou gravement malade.
4. Nous pouvons recueillir, utiliser ou communiquer des renseignements personnels à votre insu et sans votre consentement uniquement dans les circonstances restreintes permises par la loi. Par exemple :
    * Nous pouvons recueillir, utiliser ou communiquer des renseignements personnels à votre insu ou sans votre consentement s’il en va manifestement de votre intérêt et qu’il n’est pas possible d’obtenir votre consentement dans les délais requis, par exemple lorsque la personne est gravement malade.
    * Tangerine peut recueillir, utiliser et communiquer des renseignements personnels à votre insu ou sans votre consentement conformément à la loi ou à la demande légitime d’une institution gouvernementale ou d’une partie d’une institution gouvernementale. Par exemple : lorsqu’une institution gouvernementale demande légitimement cette information pour l’application d’une loi fédérale ou provinciale canadienne d’un territoire étranger.
5. Vous pouvez, à tout moment, refuser de donner votre consentement à la collecte, à l’utilisation ou à la communication de renseignements personnels ou retirer votre consentement à cette fin, par la remise d’un avis raisonnable, sous réserve de certaines exceptions. Notamment, vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à l’utilisation, par Tangerine, de votre NAS dans le but de confirmer votre identité.
    * Nous vous informerons des conséquences de votre refus ou du retrait de votre consentement. Si vous refusez de donner votre consentement à la collecte, à l’utilisation ou à la communication de renseignements personnels ou le retirer à cette fin, il se pourrait que nous ne puissions plus vous offrir un produit et/ou un service. Par exemple, si vous ne nous autorisez pas à obtenir un rapport de solvabilité, nous pourrions ne pas être en mesure de vous octroyer un prêt.
    * Nous pourrions être tenus en vertu d’une loi ou d’un règlement ou encore aux termes d’un contrat de recueillir, d’utiliser ou de communiquer certains de vos renseignements personnels, auquel cas vous ne pourrez pas retirer votre consentement. Par exemple, pendant la durée d’un prêt, vous ne pourrez retirer votre consentement à la collecte, l’utilisation ou la communication continue de vos renseignements personnels relativement au prêt que vous avez contracté auprès de nous ou qui est garanti.
    * Nous ne refuserons pas sans motif valable de fournir des produits, des services ou des renseignements à une personne qui refuse de donner son consentement ou qui l’a retiré ultérieurement.
    * Tangerine est tenue, en vertu de la loi, de rassembler certains types de renseignements personnels afin de vérifier votre identité. Si vous ne nous autorisez pas à recueillir et à utiliser renseignements à ces fins, ou si vous tentez plus tard de retirer votre consentement, nous pourrions ne pas pouvoir ouvrir un compte à votre nom ou le maintenir.
    * Une personne ne peut retirer son consentement dans le cas d’un produit de crédit à l’égard duquel nous sommes tenus de recueillir et de communiquer des renseignements après l’octroi du crédit. Cette mesure vise à préserver l’intégrité du système d’information de crédit.
    * Nous agirons selon vos directives dès que possible, mais il se pourrait que nous ne puissions cesser immédiatement d’utiliser vos renseignements à certains égards.
6. Refus et retrait
    * Si vous souhaitez retirer votre consentement ou mettre à jour vos préférences de communication en matière de marketing, veuillez communiquer avec nous au numéro sans frais **1-888-826-4374**.

### Principe - Limites applicables à la collecte des renseignements personnels

Tangerine respecte certaines limites quant au volume et à la nature des renseignements personnels qu’elle recueille. Nous recueillerons les renseignements personnels uniquement aux fins que nous vous avons déjà décrites ou en conformité avec la loi.

1. Nous ne recueillerons que le volume et le type de renseignements nécessaires aux fins répertoriées par Tangerine et telles qu’elles vous sont présentées.
2. Nous recueillerons des renseignements personnels sur vous principalement auprès de vous. Sauf en cas d’exception prévue par la loi, Tangerine recueillera des renseignements personnels auprès de sources externes uniquement si vous y avez consenti (par exemple, dans le cadre du programme « Invitez un ami »).

ARTICLE 5

### Principes - Limites applicables à l’utilisation, à la communication et à la conservation des renseignements personnels

Nous utiliserons ou communiquerons des renseignements personnels aux seules fins pour lesquelles ils ont été recueillis, à moins que la personne ne consente à ce qu’ils soient utilisés ou communiqués à d’autres fins. Dans certaines circonstances, nous pouvons avoir l’obligation légale ou le droit de communiquer des renseignements personnels à votre insu ou sans votre consentement.  

  
Nous conserverons les renseignements personnels uniquement pour la durée nécessaire aux fins précisées.

1. Nous pouvons communiquer des renseignements personnels sans le consentement de la personne lorsque la loi l’exige ou le permet. Par exemple, des renseignements peuvent être communiqués dans les cas suivants :
    * pour des citations à comparaître, des mandats de perquisition et d’autres ordonnances du tribunal ou du gouvernement;
    * pour des demandes de recouvrement de créances ou autres de la part d’autres parties ayant légalement le droit d’avoir accès aux renseignements personnels; et
    * pour la communication de renseignements personnels à un avocat, ou à un notaire au Québec, représentant Tangerine afin de protéger ses intérêts.
2. Dans les circonstances mentionnées ci-dessus, nous protégerons vos intérêts et, à cette fin, nous nous assurerons de ce qui suit :
    * l’ordonnance ou la demande semble conforme à la loi en vertu de laquelle elle a été délivrée;
    * Lorsque la loi le permet, nous pouvons vous aviser de la réception d’une ordonnance ou d’une demande.
3. Nous ne recueillerons des renseignements médicaux qu’aux fins bien précises que nous vous avons décrites, telles que la confirmation de la date d’entrée en vigueur d’une procuration ou aux fins d’une assurance-crédit, puisque les assureurs exigent ces renseignements personnels pour évaluer le risque d’assurance et établir et administrer la couverture d’assurance. 
4. Si nous fournissons des renseignements personnels aux fins de traitement par un fournisseur de services tiers situé dans un territoire étranger, nous devrons respecter les lois et les règlements de ce territoire et pourrons communiquer les renseignements personnels conformément à ces lois et règlements. 
5. Nous détruirons, effacerons ou dépersonnaliserons les renseignements personnels dont nous n’avons plus besoin pour les fins précisées ou pour nous conformer aux exigences de la loi, conformément à nos politiques en matière de conservation des dossiers. 
6. Lorsque vous remplissez des formulaires et des demandes en ligne ou au moyen de notre appli bancaire mobile, vos réponses sont automatiquement enregistrées pendant 30 jours au maximum (version provisoire). Dans la mesure du possible, si vous ne parvenez pas à remplir un formulaire ou si vous devez changer d’appareil, vous n’aurez pas à recommencer la procédure la prochaine fois que vous ouvrirez le formulaire. Toutefois, après cette période, les renseignements que vous avez saisis seront supprimés.
7. Nous pouvons communiquer des renseignements conformément à vos demandes ou avec votre consentement. Dans certains cas, votre consentement pourrait être « implicite », c’est-à-dire qu’il sera présumé sur la base de votre action ou inaction lors du traitement de vos renseignements personnels. Vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à la collecte, à l’utilisation ou à la divulgation de vos renseignements personnels comme indiqué dans les paragraphes 3.5 et 3.6 ci-dessus.

ARTICLE 6
---------

### Principe - Exactitude des renseignements personnels

Nous veillerons à ce que les renseignements personnels en notre possession ou sous notre contrôle soient exacts et complets compte tenu des plus récents renseignements mis à notre disposition. À l’occasion, Tangerine pourrait communiquer avec vous pour confirmer vos coordonnées et vos préférences pour les communications de marketing.  
  
Vous pouvez contester l’exactitude et l’exhaustivité de vos renseignements personnels et, s’il y a lieu, les faire modifier.

1. Nous ferons raisonnablement de notre mieux pour réduire au minimum le risque de fonder une décision à votre égard sur des renseignements personnels inexacts, incomplets ou qui ne sont plus à jour. 
2. Nous ferons des efforts raisonnables pour que les renseignements personnels en notre possession et sous notre contrôle demeurent exacts et à jour si ceux-ci sont utilisés de façon continue. 
3. Nous compterons sur vous pour que vos renseignements personnels soient exacts, complets et à jour. Si vous nous démontrez que vos renseignements personnels sont inexacts, incomplets ou ne sont plus à jour, nous les réviserons ou les supprimerons. Au besoin, nous divulguerons les renseignements personnels révisés aux tiers à qui nous avons transmis des renseignements qui sont erronés ou qui ne sont plus à jour afin que ceux-ci puissent actualiser leurs dossiers. 
4. Si nous refusons de procéder à la révision des renseignements personnels, tel que vous l’avez demandé, vous pouvez contester notre décision. Nous consignerons votre contestation et la transmettrons, au besoin, à tout tiers à qui nous avons communiqué les renseignements personnels.

ARTICLE 7

### Principe - Protection des renseignements personnels

Nous protégerons les renseignements personnels en appliquant des mesures de sécurité reflétant le niveau de confidentialité de ces renseignements.

1. Nous protégerons les renseignements personnels en notre possession ou sous notre contrôle contre la perte ou le vol et contre l’accès, la communication, la reproduction, l’utilisation ou la modification non autorisée.
2. Les mesures de sécurité auxquelles Tangerine aura recours pour protéger les renseignements personnels dépendront du degré de confidentialité, du volume, de la diffusion, de la diffusion et du stockage des renseignements personnels. Nous conservons la plus grande partie de vos renseignements sur support électronique.
3. Pour protéger les renseignements personnels en notre possession ou sous notre contrôle, nous appliquerons des mesures de sécurité, dont les suivantes :
    * des mesures de sécurité matérielles, par exemple le verrouillage des classeurs et la restriction de l’accès aux bureaux;
    * des mesures de sécurité organisationnelles, par exemple le contrôle de l’accès aux centres informatiques et la restriction de l’accès aux données pertinentes; et
    * des mesures de sécurité électroniques, par exemple le recours à des mots de passe, à des numéros d’identification personnels et à des techniques de chiffrement.
4. Nous pouvons transmettre des renseignements personnels à des tiers aux fins de traitement. Nous exigerons des tiers qu’ils protègent tous les renseignements personnels conformément à nos pratiques et politiques, et comme l’exige la loi. Lorsque nous faisons affaire avec des tiers, nous ne leur transmettons que les renseignements nécessaires à la prestation des services décrits au contrat. Il est interdit à un tiers de conserver des données transmises par Tangerine, de les analyser ou de les utiliser à d’autres fins. Le tiers est tenu de protéger les renseignements personnels que Tangerine a transférés d’une manière conforme à nos principes en matière de confidentialité. Au moment de détruire des renseignements personnels ou de s’en départir, nous prendrons les précautions nécessaires pour éviter tout accès non autorisé à ceux-ci.

1. Vous avez le droit de connaître, sur demande, les renseignements personnels sur vous que nous avons en notre possession ou sous notre contrôle, le droit d’y accéder et le droit de savoir à qui nous les avons communiqués, sous réserve des exceptions prévues par les lois et les règlements.
