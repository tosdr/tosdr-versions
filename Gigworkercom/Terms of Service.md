Excluding any User Content that you may provide (defined below), you acknowledge that all the intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade dress, and trade secrets, in and to the Site and its contents are owned by GW50 or GW50 otherwise has the right to use them as part of the Site, and are subject to the copyright or other intellectual property rights of GW50 and/or to the terms of licenses held by GW50.  Neither these Terms (nor your access to the Site) transfers to you or any third party any rights, title or interest in or to such intellectual property rights, except for the limited access rights expressly set forth in Section 1.1. GW50 and its partners, sponsors, advertisers or suppliers (including all parties involved in creating, producing and delivering the Site and its content) (collectively, “Suppliers”) reserve all rights not granted in these Terms.  There are no implied licenses granted under these Terms. Any unauthorized use of the Site may violate copyright, trademark and other applicable laws and could result in criminal or civil penalties.  We do not warrant or represent that your use of content displayed on, or obtained through, the Site will not infringe the rights of third parties.

3.3. **Right to Review and Remove**.  

We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to review any User Content, and to investigate and/or take appropriate action against you in our sole discretion if you violate these Terms or otherwise create liability for us or any other person. Such action may include removing or modifying your User Content, terminating your Account in accordance with Section 7, reporting you to law enforcement authorities, and/or pursuing any other rights or remedies available to us at law or in equity.

3.4. **Feedback**.

If you provide GW50 with any feedback or suggestions regarding the Site (“Feedback”), you hereby assign to GW50 all rights in such Feedback and agree that GW50 shall have the right to use and fully exploit such Feedback and related information in any manner it deems appropriate.  GW50 will treat any Feedback you provide to GW50 as non-confidential and non-proprietary.  You agree that you will not submit to GW50 any information or ideas that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.  We have no obligation to use or respond to any Feedback that is submitted.

3.5. **License to Use User Content and Feedback.**  

You hereby grant (and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant) to GW50 an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid, perpetual worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use and exploit your User Content and Feedback, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing rights, in any manner it deems appropriate, all without compensating or notifying you or identifying you as a contributor.  You hereby irrevocably waive (and agree to cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to your User Content.

3.6. **Responsibility for User Content by User**.

Each Site user is solely responsible for any and all of its own User Content.  Because we do not control User Content, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any User Content, whether provided by you or by others.  We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of any User Content.  GW50 does not sponsor or endorse any User Content. Your interactions with other Site users are solely between you and such users.  You agree that GW50 will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions or any User Content posted by others.  If there is a dispute between you and any Site user, we are under no obligation to become involved.

4. **Indemnification and Defense**.  

You agree to indemnify and hold GW50 and its owners, members, managers, officers, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, licensors, service providers, suppliers, successors and assigns (collectively, its “Representatives”) harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, awards, demands, expenses and fees (including attorneys’ fees) made by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with (a) your use of the Site, or any content or materials on the Site, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations or rights of a third party or (d) your User Content.  GW50 reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.  You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of GW50.  GW50 will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

5\. **Third-Party Links & Ads.**

5.1. **Third-Party Links & Ads.**  

The Site may contain links or references to third-party websites and services, and/or display advertisements for third parties or discount or promotional codes that may be used with third parties (collectively, “**Third-Party Links & Ads**”).  Such Third-Party Links & Ads are not under the control of GW50, and GW50 is not responsible for any Third-Party Links & Ads or the content, services, products or codes provided by or through such Third-Party Links & Ads.  GW50 provides access to these Third-Party Links & Ads only as a convenience to you, and does not approve, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Links & Ads or the content, services, products or codes provided by or through such Third-Party Links & Ads.  We are not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, decency, or any other aspect of the content of, or services, products or codes provided by or through, or delays and disruption of network transmissions through, such Third-Party Links & Ads, nor are we responsible for errors or omissions in any references to other parties or their content, services, products or codes.  You use all Third-Party Links & Ads at your own risk and should apply a suitable level of caution and discretion in doing so. When you click on any of the Third-Party Links & Ads, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy and data gathering practices.  GW50 is not liable for the actions or inactions of the third party or any breach by or failure of the third-party to comply with its terms and conditions and privacy policy. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Links & Ads.  Any correspondence or transactions entered into by you with such third party, including the delivery of and the payment for goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such correspondence or transactions, are solely between you and such third-party. We are not responsible for any part of any correspondence, transaction or any other aspect of the arrangement between you and the third-party.  YOU HEREBY RELEASE GW50 AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES FROM AND AGAINST ANY LIABILITIES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR ACCESS OF, ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR CODES PROVIDED BY, OR ANY TRANSACTIONS WITH, A THIRD PARTY WEBSITE.

5.2. **Affiliate Links**.

An affiliate link (“**Affiliate Link**”) is any Third-Party Links & Ads for which GW50 receives compensation based on clicks and/or user activity on the third party’s website. GW50 uses Affiliate Links on the Site.  You may assume that all Third-Party Links & Ads on the Site are Affiliate Links. When you click an Affiliate Link, your web browser automatically shares certain information. This includes, for example, the web address of the page that you are visiting and your IP address. We may also set cookies on your browser or read cookies that are already there.

5.3**. Linking to the Site and Social Media Features**.

You may link to our homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part without our express written consent. You agree to cooperate with us in causing any unauthorized framing or linking immediately to cease.  We reserve the right to withdraw linking permission without notice.  We may disable all or any social media features and any links at any time without notice in our discretion.

6\. **Limits on Liability**.

6.1. **Waiver of Claims.**  

You hereby release and forever discharge GW50 and its Representatives from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Site (including any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Site users or any Third-Party Links & Ads).  IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.”

6.2. **Disclaimer of Warranties**.

THE SITE, AND ALL CONTENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTAINED THEREON, ACCESSED THROUGH OR PROVIDED BY THE SITE, ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. GW50 (AND OUR SUPPLIERS) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OR USE AS TO THE SITE, INCLUDING THE INFORMATION, DATA, SOFTWARE OR PRODUCTS CONTAINED THEREIN, OR THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY THEIR USE OR AS TO THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF.  WE (AND OUR SUPPLIERS) MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SITE, OR CONTENT, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES CONTAINED ON, ACCESSED THROUGH OR PROVIDED BY THE SITE, WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS, OR WILL BE ACCURATE, FREE FROM MISTAKES OR DEFECTS, RELIABLE, FREE OF VIRUSES, OTHER HARMFUL CODE, SECURITY PROBLEMS (INCLUDING UNAUTHORIZED INTERCEPTION OF DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS), COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR SAFE.  IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FIRST USE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.3. **Limitation on Liability**.

ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SITE, INCLUDING THE DOWNLOADING OR OTHER ACQUISITION OF MATERIALS OR INFORMATION FROM OR THROUGH THE SITE, IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE OR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.

IN NO EVENT SHALL GW50, NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY ANY:

* USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE SITE
* USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) ANY SITE TO WHICH YOU HYPERLINK FROM OUR SITE
* FAILURE OF OUR SITE TO PERFORM IN THE MANNER YOU EXPECTED OR DESIRED
* ERROR ON OUR SITE; OMISSION ON OUR SITE; INTERRUPTION OF AVAILABILITY OF OUR SITE; DEFECT ON OUR SITE; DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OF OUR SITE; COMPUTER VIRUS OR LIKE FAILURE; DAMAGES INTENDED TO COMPENSATE SOMEONE DIRECTLY FOR A LOSS OR INJURY
* PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
* DAMAGES REASONABLY EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM A LOSS OR INJURY (KNOWN IN LEGAL TERMS AS “CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.”)
* OTHER MISCELLANEOUS DAMAGES AND EXPENSES RESULTING DIRECTLY FROM A LOSS OR INJURY (KNOWN IN LEGAL TERMS AS “INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.”)

WE ARE NOT LIABLE EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT OR IF OUR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR BOTH.

EXCEPTION: CERTAIN STATE LAWS MAY NOT ALLOW US TO LIMIT OR EXCLUDE LIABILITY FOR THESE “INCIDENTAL” OR “CONSEQUENTIAL” DAMAGES.  IF YOU LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE STATES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT APPLY WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECOVER THESE TYPES OF DAMAGES.

HOWEVER, IN ANY EVENT, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL LOSSES, DAMAGES, INJURIES, AND CLAIMS OF ANY AND EVERY KIND (WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARE CLAIMED UNDER THE TERMS OF A CONTRACT, OR CLAIMED TO BE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER WRONGFUL CONDUCT, OR WHETHER CLAIMED UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY) WILL NOT BE GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT YOU PAID, IF ANYTHING, TO ACCESS OUR SITE. YOU AGREE THAT OUR SUPPLIERS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE OR ANY PART THEREOF OR ANY ACTION ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS.

6.4  **Force Majeure Events**.

8. **Copyright Policy and Infringement Complaints**.  

GW50 respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users of our Site do the same.  In connection with our Site, we have adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our Site who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights, including copyrights.  If you believe that one of our users is, through the use of our Site, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:

(b) identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed;

(c) identification of the material on our Site that you claim is infringing and that you request us to remove;

(d) sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;

(e) your address, telephone number, and email address;

(f) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or under the law; and

(g) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing, or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, is potentially liable for damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by us.

These Terms are effective as of the “Last Revised” date set forth above. We have the right to change or update these Terms at our discretion.
