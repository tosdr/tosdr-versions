**How we collect information**

We collect and obtain personal information at various points throughout the Sites, including from our subscribers during the free membership registration process, paid subscription process and, occasionally, at other times. This information, which ranges from limited personal information such as age and address to facts about subscribers' computers, professions and leisure habits, is then securely stored on separate servers. Specifically, our sources of personal information include:

You. We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, for example if you decide to register an account, place a bet, sign up for our rewards program, shop through the Sites, subscribe to a service, or otherwise request a product/service or actively engage with the Sites.

**Cookie Technology.** We employ cookie technology to help subscribers move faster through our Site. When a consumer visits our Site or subscriber signs on to DRF Online, we pass several cookies to that user's computer. A cookie is a string of information that's sent by a Web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of checking our registration database each time a page is requested. The cookie is deleted when a user chooses the log out feature to terminate their session. We also employ cookie technology to store subscribers' User Names and Passwords. Read our cookie disclosure statement and view a cookie-by-cookie breakdown.

• To monitor and evaluate our Sites and identify where we should make changes or expand services;

• To provide advertisers with information that does not directly identify you (e.g. aggregate information about our subscriber base and usage patterns) ;

• To give DRF's marketing and development staff information that's useful for developing new features and services that meet subscriber needs;

• To share data with our affiliated companies for joint marketing and other purposes; and

You can direct us not to sell or share your personal information by submitting an opt-out request through the link “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” which can be accessed at the bottom of our Site, or by contacting us at [cservice2@drf.com](mailto:cservice2@drf.com). We also honor the Global Privacy Control, a browser-based opt-out signal. We do not respond to other browser-based signals that do not meet applicable state law requirements, which may include older Do Not Track signals.

Right to Appeal. You have a right to appeal decisions concerning your ability to exercise your consumer rights.

• By using your password-protected account and going to the [Member Update](https://registration.drf.com/member-update) page;

• Provide the authorized agent written permission to act on your behalf; and

• Verify your own identity with us before we can honor the request.

No Discrimination. We will not discriminate against a California resident because the California resident exercised any of the rights described here.

**Additional Information for California Users**

• _Notice of Financial Incentive_.  As part of our services, there will be opportunities to participate in surveys and rewards programs. If you choose to participate in a survey or a rewards program, we may offer you coupons, discounts, or other promotions (e.g. enhanced stays and special benefits at our property). Such offers may not be available at all times. The amount and terms of such offers will be presented to you at the time of the offer. You can terminate your participation in these offers using the rights described in this Privacy Policy.
