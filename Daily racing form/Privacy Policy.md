**How we collect information**

We collect and obtain personal information at various points throughout the Sites, including from our subscribers during the free membership registration process, paid subscription process and, occasionally, at other times. This information, which ranges from limited personal information such as age and address to facts about subscribers' computers, professions and leisure habits, is then securely stored on separate servers. Specifically, our sources of personal information include:

You. We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, for example if you decide to register an account, place a bet, sign up for our rewards program, shop through the Sites, subscribe to a service, or otherwise request a product/service or actively engage with the Sites.

**Cookie Technology.** We employ cookie technology to help subscribers move faster through our Site. When a consumer visits our Site or subscriber signs on to DRF Online, we pass several cookies to that user's computer. A cookie is a string of information that's sent by a Web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of checking our registration database each time a page is requested. The cookie is deleted when a user chooses the log out feature to terminate their session. We also employ cookie technology to store subscribers' User Names and Passwords. Read our cookie disclosure statement and view a cookie-by-cookie breakdown.

• To transfer information in the event of a merger, transfer of assets or other organizational restructuring;

• To monitor and evaluate our Sites and identify where we should make changes or expand services;

• To provide advertisers with information that does not directly identify you (e.g. aggregate information about our subscriber base and usage patterns) ;

• To give DRF's marketing and development staff information that's useful for developing new features and services that meet subscriber needs;

• To share data with our affiliated companies for joint marketing and other purposes; and

Specifically, we will share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:

**Our affiliate companies**;, for purposes of fulfilling an order or other request, or jointly marketing products/services;

**Our service providers**, which are companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the our Sites or our business. For example, we share your payment information with third party service providers for purposes of processing your payment for products and services that you purchase. We also share personal information with third party analytics companies that help us to monitor traffic on the Sites, learn how users are navigating our Sites, and help troubleshoot or improve the services we provide.

Our **business partners**, which are non-affiliated third parties who provide products/services that may be of interest to you.

We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful;

**Successor company or companies** in the event that DRF ceases operations for any reason.

We will require that such purchasers continue to comply with the provisions as outlined in this Privacy Policy;

**Market-research firms**, as more fully described below.

**Research**

We may contract with a market-research firm to conduct occasional online surveys. When you're within DRF Online, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. If you do not wish to participate, simply click the "No, Thank You" link and you will not see this window again. If you choose to participate, you'll be prompted to answer a series of online questions. You will be prompted to enter your e-mail address for validation purposes but no other personal information (name, address, etc.) will be collected as part of the survey. In some cases, however, you may be offered a free gift for your participation. We will need your name and address, which will be used exclusively to fulfill your gift request.

You have the following rights, where provided under applicable state law, regarding your personal information (each of which are subject to various exceptions and limitations):

Right of Access. You have the right to access your personal information maintained by us. Upon receipt of a verifiable request to access personal information, we will disclose and deliver, free of charge, the personal information requested.

Please note that we are not required to provide personal information to you more than twice in a 12-month period.

_Right of Correction. You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information collected from you._ 

_Right of Deletion._ You have the right to request that we delete any personal information about you which we have collected from you. Upon receipt of a verifiable request for deletion, we will delete your personal information from our records and direct any service providers to delete your personal information from our records, within 45 days.

We will comply with your request to delete personal information unless it is necessary for us to maintain your personal information in order to:

• Complete a transaction, provide requested-for goods/services, and/or perform a contract between you and us;

• Detect security incidents;

• Comply with a legal obligation;

• Enable our internal uses that are aligned with your expectations and your relationship with us.

Submission of Requests for Deletion. We have designated the following methods to submit requests for deletion: (1) By submitting a request via [cservice2@drf.com](mailto:cservice2@drf.com), or (2) By calling 1-(800) 306-FORM (3676)? 

After you submit a request, we will promptly take steps to determine whether your request is a verifiable request. We will verify that you are who you say you are by:

Having you log-in through your password-protected account; or.

Having you provide unique information relating to a recent transaction or order.

We will delete your personal information to you free of charge within 45 days of receiving your verifiable request. If necessary, we will extend the time period by an additional 45 days, and will provide you with notice of the extension within the first 45-day period. 

_Right to Opt Out (Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information_). You have the right to opt-out of the “sale” of your personal information (defined very broadly to include situations where we provide personal information to partners who provide advertising services to us) and the “sharing” of personal information in connection with the display of targeted advertising across third party Web sites. You can direct us not to sell or share your personal information by contacting us at [cservice2@drf.com](mailto:cservice2@drf.com). We also honor the Global Privacy Control, a browser-based opt-out signal. We do not respond to other browser-based signals that do not meet applicable state law requirements, which may include older Do Not Track signals.

Right to Appeal. You have a right to appeal decisions concerning your ability to exercise your consumer rights.  

Submission of Requests for Information. We have designated the following methods for residents of applicable US states to submit the above requests for information:

• By using your password-protected account and going to the [Member Update](https://registration.drf.com/member-update) page;

• By submitting a request via [cservice2@drf.com](mailto:cservice2@drf.com);

• By calling 1-(800) 306-FORM (3676)

Verification. After you submit a request, we will promptly take steps to determine whether your request is a verifiable request. We will verify that you are who you say you are by:

• Having you log-in through your password-protected account; or.

• Having you provide unique information relating to a recent transaction or order.

We will disclose and deliver the required information to you free of charge within 45 days of receiving your verifiable request. If necessary, we will extend the time period to provide the required information once by an additional 45 days, and will provide you with notice of the extension within the first 45-day period. 

As noted below, we do not knowingly collect information from or about children, including children aged 18 and under. We do not sell information of minors under 18 years of age.

Authorized Agent. You have the right to designate an authorized agent to submit an access or deletion request on your behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit such a request, we will require that you:

• Provide the authorized agent written permission to act on your behalf; and

• Verify your own identity with us before we can honor the request.

No Discrimination. We will not discriminate against a California resident because the California resident exercised any of the rights described here.

**Additional Information for California Users**

• _Notice of Financial Incentive_.  As part of our services, there will be opportunities to participate in surveys and rewards programs. If you choose to participate in a survey or a rewards program, we may offer you coupons, discounts, or other promotions (e.g. enhanced stays and special benefits at our property). Such offers may not be available at all times. The amount and terms of such offers will be presented to you at the time of the offer. You can terminate your participation in these offers using the rights described in this Privacy Policy. Our good faith estimate of the value of your personal information is the value of the benefit we offer to you. We have calculated such value by using the expense related to the benefit.

_Shine the Light_. California’s “Shine The Light” law permits California residents to annually request and obtain information free of charge about what personal information is disclosed to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.
