**TERMS OF SERVICE**

**Last Updated: October 19, 2017**

Welcome to [www.ricksteves.com](https://www.ricksteves.com/) and all ricksteves.com subdomains (account.ricksteves, auth.ricksteves, store.ricksteves, community.ricksteves, etc.), which is operated by Rick Steves' Europe, Inc. ("**Rick Steves**," "**we**," "**us**" or "**our**"). These terms and conditions of use (these "**Terms**") apply to your use of [www.ricksteves.com](https://www.ricksteves.com/) or any successor website of Rick Steves (the "**Site**") and any services or content made available through the Site (collectively, with the Site, the "**Services**"). These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with us for products, services or otherwise. Customers and distributors of Rick Steves' products and services may be subject to additional terms and conditions.

**Accepting these Terms**

BY CLICKING TO INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU ARE ACCESSING OR USING OUR SERVICES ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON (SUCH AS USING THE SERVICES TO BOOK A TOUR FOR MULTIPLE PEOPLE OR GROUPS), YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT PERSON OR GROUP'S BEHALF.  IF ANYTHING IN THESE TERMS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO YOU, PLEASE LET US KNOW.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, IN PARTICULAR THE TERMS RELATED TO MEDICAL INFORMATION OR ARBITRATION, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.

**Changes to these Terms**

We encourage you to review the Terms regularly to know about our practices. We may change these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will let you know by revising the date at the top of these Terms and, in some cases, providing you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage). Any changes we make to these Terms will be effective when we post them. If you use the Services after we have posted the changed Terms, then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.

**Terms of Sale**

All sales made through the Services are governed by these Terms of Sale. Tours, and deposits for our tours, are also governed by our [Tour Conditions](https://www.ricksteves.com/tours/tour-conditions) ([www.ricksteves.com/tours/tour-conditions](https://www.ricksteves.com/tours/tour-conditions)), which are incorporated into these Terms by this reference. The Terms of Sale are subject to change without notice, at any time and in our sole discretion, so you should review the Terms of Sale each time you make a purchase through the Services.

All prices are shown in US dollars (except where otherwise noted) and taxes, shipping and handling charges are additional. All items are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order, to reject all or any part of an order and to discontinue products without notice, even if you have already placed your order. All prices are subject to change without notice, and you agree that taxes may be adjusted from the amount shown on the payment checkout screens. Several factors may cause this adjustment, such as variances between processor programs, changes in tax rates, and the euro exchange rate fluctuation. 

You will be responsible for any applicable sales or use taxes, duties or other governmental taxes or fees payable in connection with your purchase. If you do not pay such taxes or fees in connection with a transaction, you will be responsible for such taxes or fees in the event that they are later determined to be payable. Rick Steves reserves the right to collect such taxes or other fees from you at any time.

Only valid credit cards and other payment methods acceptable to us may be used to purchase products through the Site, and all refunds will be credited to the same credit card or, in our discretion, other payment method. By submitting an order through the Site, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated credit card or other payment method and authorize us, or our third-party payment processor, to charge that card or other payment method for the purchase amount of your order (including taxes, shipping, handling and any other amounts described on the Site). When you provide your payment information, you authorize us, or our third-party payment processor, to process and store your payment and other related information. In the event that the credit card or other payment method you designate cannot be verified, is invalid or is not otherwise acceptable, we may suspend or cancel your order automatically. You are responsible for resolving any problem we encounter in order to proceed with your order.

**Disclaimers**

THE SERVICES AND ANY CONTENT INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY MATERIALS) ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN AS-IS BASIS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN) WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES AND CONTENT INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY MATERIALS) WHETHER ALLEGED TO ARISE BY OPERATION OF LAW, BY REASON OF CUSTOM OR USAGE IN THE TRADE, BY COURSE OF DEALING OR OTHERWISE.

**Limitation of Liability**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (A) IN NO EVENT WILL RICK STEVES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES OR ANY OTHER SERVICE AND CONTENT INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY MATERIALS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES OR ARE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES; AND (B) THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF RICK STEVES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF RICK STEVES' ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES MAY NOT EXCEED ANY COMPENSATION YOU PAY, IF ANY, TO RICK STEVES FOR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES.

**Release**

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release the Rick Steves Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. **You expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any other statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.**

**Changes to the Services**

Rick Steves reserves the right in our discretion to review, improve, change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services and/or any features, information, materials or content on the Services with or without providing notice to you. Rick Steves will not be liable to you or any third party for any changes or discontinuance of the Services or any part of the Services.

**Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration**

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Rick Steves and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.

Except for small claims disputes in which you or Rick Steves seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Rick Steves seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Rick Steves waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Snohomish County, Washington in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("Rules") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason. 

You and Rick Steves agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Rick Steves and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

You and Rick Steves agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 14 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and Rick Steves agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Rick Steves will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Rick Steves, Rick Steves will pay all JAMS fees and costs.  You and Rick Steves agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Washington and the United States sitting in Snohomish County, Washington have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. 

ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND RICK STEVES WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM. 

You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this paragraph by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.ricksteves.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the Governing Law section of these Terms.

**Governing Law**

These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be filed only in the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington, and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.

**General**

Enforcement of these Terms is solely at Rick Steves' discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. We reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to access or use our Services. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.
