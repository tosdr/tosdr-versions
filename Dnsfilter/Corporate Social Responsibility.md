WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY
====================

DNSFilter requires all its directors, officers, employees, and contractors to observe the highest standards of business and ethics while conducting their duties and responsibilities as outlined in our Ethics Code. As employees and representatives of DNSFilter, we must practice honesty and integrity in fulfilling all our responsibilities and complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

#### Reporting Responsibility

It is the responsibility of all directors, officers, contractors, and employees to report concerns about violations of DNSFilter’s Ethics Code or suspected violations of law or regulations that govern DNSFilter’s operations. This Whistleblower Policy is intended to encourage and enable employees and others to raise ethical and other serious concerns internally so that DNSFilter can address and correct inappropriate conduct and actions.

#### No Retaliation

It is contrary to the values of DNSFilter for anyone to retaliate against any director, officer, contractor, or employee who makes a good-faith report of an ethics violation, or a suspected violation of law.

Any whistleblower who believes he/she is being retaliated against must contact the VP - Human Resources immediately. The right of a whistleblower for protection against retaliation does not include immunity for any personal wrongdoing that is alleged and investigated.An employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

#### Reporting Procedure

DNSFilter has an open-door policy and suggests that employees share their questions, concerns, suggestions, or complaints with their supervisor. If you are not comfortable speaking with your supervisor or you are not satisfied with your supervisor’s response, you are encouraged to follow the chain of command or speak with another member of the Executive Team. Alternatively, you may submit an [Whistleblower Complaint Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bY_rkKnW-cgr9GoJFgmAWvJaO9SXEa4pwmjdmVGZL6k/edit?ts=62742230) (may be completed anonymously).

Supervisors and managers are required to report complaints or concerns about suspected ethical and legal violations in writing to [legal@dnsfilter.com](mailto:legal@dnsfilter.com). DNSFilter’s Legal Department is responsible for ensuring that all complaints about unethical or illegal conduct are investigated and resolved.

Individuals who do not feel comfortable reporting their concerns internally are encouraged to contact their state’s Attorney General’s office to report their concerns.

#### Acting in Good Faith

Anyone filing a complaint concerning a violation or suspected violation must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation. Any allegations which have been made maliciously or while knowing such allegations to be false may be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.

#### Confidentiality

Any person submitting a report may choose to do so on an anonymous basis. Reports of violations or suspected violations will be kept confidential to the extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.

#### Handling of Reported Violations

DNSFilter will acknowledge receipt of the reported violation or suspected violation. All reports will be promptly investigated, and appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by the investigation.

#### **Contact Us**

If you have any questions about this policy, please email [HR@dnsfilter.com](mailto:HR@dnsfilter.com)
