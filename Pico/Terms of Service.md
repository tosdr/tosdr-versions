You further acknowledge that, except as required under statutory law or specifically permitted by us in these Terms or in another written agreement you enter into with us, you (a) have no right to receive any income or other consideration from any User Content (defined below) or your use of any musical works, sound recordings or audiovisual clips made available to you on or through our Services, including in any User Content created by you, and (b) are prohibited from exercising any rights to monetise or obtain consideration from any User Content within our Services or on any third party service (e.g., you cannot claim, for monetisation, User Content that has been uploaded to a third party platform).

You acknowledge that we have no obligation to pro-actively pre-screen, monitor, review, or edit any content transmitted or uploaded by you and other users on our Services.

**User Content**

Users of our Services may be permitted to upload, post or transmit or otherwise make available content through our Services including, without limitation, any text, photographs, user videos, artworks, animations, model, sound recordings and the musical works embodied therein, including videos that incorporate locally stored sound recordings from your personal music library and ambient noise ("**User Content**"). We may also from time to time make available functionalities that enable users of our Services to extract all or any portion of User Content created by another user to produce additional User Content, including collaborative User Content with other users, that combine and intersperse User Content generated by more than one user, or enable users to overlay music, graphics, stickers, virtual items, and other elements provided by PICO ("**PICO Elements**") onto User Content and transmit this User Content through our Services. The information and materials in the User Content, including User Content that includes PICO Elements, have not been verified or approved by us. The views expressed by other users on our Services do not represent our views or values.

Whenever you access or use a feature that allows you to upload or transmit User Content through our Services (including to third party platforms), or to make contact with other users of our Services, you must comply with the standards set out at "Your Access to and Use of PICO Services" above at Paragraph 6. You may also choose to upload or transmit your User Content, including User Content that includes PICO Elements, on sites or platforms hosted by third parties. If you decide to do this, you must comply with their content guidelines as well as with the standards set out at "Your Access to and Use of PICO Services" above at Paragraph 6. You warrant that any such upload, transmission, and/or contact complies with those standards, and you shall be liable to us and fully indemnify us for any breach of that warranty -- this means you shall be fully responsible for any loss or damage we suffer as a result of your breach of this warranty.

You must not post any User Content on or through our Services or transmit to us any User Content that is confidential or proprietary. Any User Content shall be deemed to be non-confidential and non-proprietary.

When you submit User Content through our Services, you agree and represent that you own that User Content, or that you have received all necessary permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to our Services for all purposes contemplated under these Terms, to transmit it from our Services to other third party platforms, adopt or integrate any third party content (as the case may be), and grant us and our affiliates all licences in User Content as contemplated under these Terms. For example, if you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not submit such sound recordings to our Services unless you have all permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to our Services. You must not expose PICO or other users to any intellectual property claims or any other type of claim relating to User Content that you submit through our Services.

**You must not upload any User Content to which you are not the owner of the intellectual property rights. You or the relevant owner (as the case may be) of your User Content may still own any copyright in User Content submitted to our Services, save that by agreeing to these Terms, when submitting or transmitting User Content via our Services, you hereby grant us and our affiliates an unconditional non-exclusive (subject to mandatory statutory remuneration claims) royalty-free, fully transferable, worldwide licence to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, access, download, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit, and/or distribute and to authorise other users of our Services and other third-parties to view, access, use, download, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit your User Content in any format and on our Services or our social network pages, for purposes of operating the Services and for marketing and promotional purposes. This licence is granted for the legal duration of the intellectual property rights pertaining on your User Content. You further grant us an unconditional non-exclusive, subject to mandatory statutory remuneration claims royalty-free, fully transferable, worldwide licence to use your user name(s) and image(s) to identify you as the source of any of your User Content, for the time of publication of your User Content.**

For the avoidance of doubt, the rights you grant in your User Content under these Terms include, but are not limited to, the right for us and other users of our Services to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly perform and communicate to the public sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting us the right to use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights or collective management organisation, nor any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved in the creation of User Content.

We, or third parties, authorise, shall have the right to cut, crop, edit or refuse to publish, User Content at our or their sole and absolute discretion. To avoid doubt, we have the right – but not the obligation – to remove, disallow, block or delete any User Content (i) that we consider to violate these Terms, or (ii) in response to complaints from other users or third parties. Where required, we will inform you of the reasons for our actions without undue delay. Where in accordance with applicable laws, we will reinstall access to any User Content without undue delay where we are provided compelling reasons that our action was not justified.

PICO may take reasonable measures to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. It is PICO's policy, to disable or terminate the accounts of users of our Services who infringe intellectual property or other rights.

We may from time to time make available features that may allow you to control whether your User Content is made publicly available on our Services to all other users of our Services or only available to people you designate. To restrict access to your User Content accordingly, it is your responsibility to select the appropriate setting, if available, within PICO or on such channel as we may designate.

Despite the above, we do not represent or warrant the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness, quality of any User Content, nor that the User Content does not infringe intellectual property rights, and under no circumstances shall we be liable in any way for any User Content (including for the avoidance of doubt any third party materials incorporated in User Content), except if informed of an unlawful content and failing to promptly removing it. We shall have no liability in respect of any User Content published by third parties.

**Feedback**

If you choose to contribute by sending us any ideas for products, services, features, modifications, enhancements, content, refinements, technologies, content offerings (such as audio, visual, games, or other types of content), promotions, strategies, or product/feature names, or any related documentation, artwork, computer code, diagrams, or other materials (collectively "**Feedback**"), then regardless of what your accompanying communication may say, the following terms will apply, so that future misunderstandings can be avoided. Accordingly, by sending Feedback to us, you agree that:

* PICO has no obligation to review, consider, or implement your Feedback, or to return to you all or part of any Feedback for any reason;
* Feedback is provided on a non-confidential basis, and we are not under any obligation to keep any Feedback you send confidential or to refrain from using or disclosing it in any way; and
* you irrevocably grant us permission to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, modify, publicly perform (including on a through-to-the-audience basis), communicate to the public, make available, publicly display, and otherwise use and exploit the Feedback and derivatives thereof worldwide, on our Services and our social network pages, for the purposes of improving our Services or for marketing purposes free of charge. This authorisation is granted for the legal duration of the intellectual property rights pertaining to your Feedback.

20\. Content Moderation
-----------------------

We review User Content, including user profiles and other content uploaded by our users proactively (through systems we have in place which detect illegal and harmful User Content, including User Content which may be in violation of these Terms or our Community Guidelines) and reactively (for example, on receipt of notice from users or authorities). To do this, we deploy a combination of technology and human moderators.

* We use automated moderation technology to identify Content that violates our Terms or Community Guidelines. This technology looks at a variety of signals across User Content, which may include for example, keywords or images to detect potential violations.
* Human moderators work alongside our automated moderation systems to review and assess User Content that may violate our Terms or Community Guidelines. Our moderators undergo regular training on our content moderation processes and policies.

We may prevent the creation of certain User Content, restrict the visibility or use of User Content or otherwise remove or restrict access to User Content if we reasonably believe (i) it is in breach of these Terms or our Community Guidelines or (ii) it causes harm to us, affiliates, our users or other third parties. In case of severe or repeated violations, we might also take account level action, including suspending your access to certain features, or temporarily or permanently banning your account. Our Terms and Community Guidelines set out what types of User Content might be restricted or removed.

If you think we have made a mistake in removing or restricting your content or restricting or suspending your account, you can contact us via support.global\[at\]picoxr.com.

25\. Supplemental Terms – Jurisdiction-Specific
-----------------------------------------------

**Germany**

For users that have their habitual residence in Germany, the following rules apply and supersede any conflicting provisions in the Terms.

Limitation of Liability

PICO shall be fully liable for intent and gross negligence as well as for damages caused by injury to life, body or health. In an event of slight negligence, we shall be liable only for breaches of a material contractual obligation, limited to the typical and foreseeable damages at the time the contract was concluded. A material contractual obligation in the meaning of this provision is an obligation whose fulfilment makes the implementation of this contract possible in the first place and of which the contractual partner may therefore generally rely. Any potential liability on the part of PICO for any guarantees and for claims based on the German Product Liability Act shall not be affected. The limitation of liability shall apply mutatis mutandis to the benefit of the employees, agents and vicarious agents of PICO.

**France**

As a consumer, you have the following statutory rights and guarantees in relation to the Services and Digital Products. PICO will therefore offer you the protection granted by law under the legal warranty of conformity provided by articles L. 224-25-12 to L. 224-25-26 of the French Consumer Code.  
  
**Guarantee of conformity**  
  
PICO is liable for supplying digital contents and services that comply with the contract with the objective and subjective criteria set out by the law. Regarding one-off supply, PICO is accountable for any non-conformity that exists at the time of supply and becoming apparent within two years of supply. Regarding digital content of service supplied on a continuous basis, PICO is accountable for any non-conformity which becomes apparent during the period in which it is supplied under the contract. PICO is also accountable, within the same time limits, for any non-conformity resulting from the incorrect integration of the digital content or service into the consumer's digital environment where this has been done by PICO or under its responsibility, or where the incorrect integration by the consumer is the result of deficiencies in the instructions provided by PICO.  
  
For the 12 month period following the supply of the Services or Digital Product, you will not be required to prove the existence of the defect.  
  
In the event of lack of conformity, you shall be entitled to have the Service or Digital Product brought into conformity or, failing that, to have the price reduced or to cancel the contract, under the below conditions  
  
\-Compliance shall be achieved at no cost to you, without undue delay following you request and without significant inconvenience, taking into account the nature of the Service or Digital Product concerned and the use that you intended;  
  
\-You shall not be required to pay for the use you made of the Service or Digital Product during the period, prior to termination of the contract, in which that Service or Digital Product was not in conformity.  
  
\-You are entitled to a reduction in price or to rescission of the contract in the following cases:  
  
1\. Where PICO refuses to bring the digital content or service into conformity;  
2\. Where the bringing into conformity of the Service or Digital Product is unjustifiably delayed or causes costs or major inconvenience to you;  
3\. Where the non-conformity of the Service or Digital Product persists despite PICO's unsuccessful attempt to bring it into conformity;  
  
You shall also be entitled to a price reduction or rescission of the contract where the lack of conformity is so serious as to justify immediate price reduction or rescission of the contract. You are then not obliged to ask for the Service or Digital Product to be brought into conformity beforehand. However, the contract may not be rescinded if the lack of conformity is minor, which is for PICO to demonstrate (this shall not apply to contracts where you do not pay a price).  
  
When you choose to obtain a price reduction or to cancel the contract, you shall inform PICO of your decision to obtain a price reduction. The price reduction shall be proportionate to the difference between the value of the Service or Digital Content provided and the value of that Service or Digital Content in the absence of the lack of conformity. The refund to the consumer of any sums due by PICO, or any other benefit received under the contract, shall be made without undue delay and at the latest within 14 days from the day on which you inform PICO of your decision to exercise your right to reduce the price or rescind the contract. PICO shall reimburse these sums using the same means of payment as the one you used at the time of the conclusion of the contract, unless you expressly agree otherwise and in any case without any additional cost.
