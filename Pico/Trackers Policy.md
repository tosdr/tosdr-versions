**PICO Cookies Policy**

  
_Last Updated: 17 Dec 2024_

This Cookies Policy applies whenever you visit a website on the "picoxr.com" and "business.picoxr.com" domain, unless expressly stated otherwise (collectively, the “**Websites**” and each a "**Website**"). Other than the Websites, this Cookies Policy does not apply to any of our services, applications, products and content, which are each subject to their own, separate, notices.  
  
On the Websites, we use cookies and other tracking technologies such as software development kits (each, an "**SDK**"), application programmable interfaces (each, an "**API**"), pixels and local or session storages. These technologies allow us to store information or gain access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish you from other visitors. Tracking technologies are used by most website providers to let users navigate between pages efficiently, ensure web security, understand how their websites are used, remember user preferences and generally improve the user experience.

  
**What tracking** **technologies are used?**

The Websites use the following kinds of tracking technologies:  
Cookies: Cookies are small text files that enable us and our service providers and partners to uniquely identify your browser or device for various purposes, including those described above. Cookies normally work by assigning a unique number to your device and are stored on your browser by the websites that you visit as well as third party service providers and partners to those websites.  
Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser.  
Other cookies are "persistent cookies", meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. Most persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months). When you return to that website (or visit other websites that use the same cookies) the website provider or its service providers can recognise the persistent cookies they have set and recognise your browsing device.

  
Local storage: Local storage files are created by apps and websites to store information locally on your device. They are very similar to cookies, but can have slightly different properties (for example, local storage can be used to store more information and can be stored in a different location on your device to cookies). Local storage is normally used to speed up app and site functionality and remember your preferences.

  
Session Storage. This technology is used by websites to temporarily store data on your device while you are actively using the Websites. Unlike persistent cookies or local storage, session storage data is only available during your current visit to the website.

  
API: An API is a piece of software which helps two or more applications to talk to one another. We use them to communicate between Pico and our service providers.

  
SDK: An SDK is a piece of code that enables data to be collected about your device, network and interaction with a website. Like cookies, it generally operates by assigning your device a unique number.
