When you use the PICO Services, such as when you create a PICO account, contact our customer support team, use the PICO product, or participate in an online survey, we collect your personal data, including:

* **Direct messages and voice chat.** When you compose, send, or receive communications, such as direct messages or voice chat, using PICO apps such as PICO Friends and PICO Video, we process the content of the communication and the associated metadata (such as the time the message was sent, received and/or read, as well as the participants in the communication). We do this to provide the service, block spam, detect crime, and to safeguard our users.

We also receive information about how you use the apps on the PICO headset, for instance, we receive information about your PICO Browser usage such as which browser features you use. When you make a choice in the PICO headset settings, we will also record your choice.
* **Device and network information**. We collect information about the type of device you're using to interact with the PICO Services, such as a headset, PC, TV, or mobile phone; the configuration of the device, such as the device brand and model, name and version of the operating system, and screen resolution; your network, such information about your local wireless network and your IP address; and how your device is performing, such as the battery level.
