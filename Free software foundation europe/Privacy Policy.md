Security principles
-------------------

* \[DRAFT\]

By default, we apply the following principles to assure the security of your data:

* we use only Free Software and open standards;
* we apply a need to know principle for all our processing;
* no password is in cleartext;
* we log the minimum amount of information to allow us to debug or assure the security of our system;
* we in general encourage staff and volunteers to use encryption for communication and file storage;
* very few people have access to servers where the data is stored
