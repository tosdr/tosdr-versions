Your privacy is important to us. It is Lioneur’s policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our website, [https://lioneur.com](https://wordtohtml.net/), and other sites we own and operate.

Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use a website or online service.

In the event our site contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our site.

This policy is effective as of 13 June 2021.

If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.

However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.

### Additional Disclosures for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance (EU)

We, Lioneur, located at the address provided in our Contact Us section, are a Data Controller and/or Processor with respect to the personal information you provide to us.

#### Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information

We will only collect and use your personal information when we have a legal right to do so.

If we seek your consent to process your personal information, and you are under 16 years of age, we will seek your parent or legal guardian’s consent to process your personal information for that specific purpose.

Our lawful bases depend on the services you use and how you use them. This means we only collect and use your information on the following grounds:

##### Consent From You

Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your information that has already taken place. You may consent to providing your name and contact details for the purpose of entering a giveaway or promotion.

If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.

##### Performance of a Contract or Transaction

##### Compliance with Law

If you have any further enquiries about how we retain personal information in order to comply with the law, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.

#### International Transfers Outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)

**Objecting to processing:** You have the right to object to processing of your personal information that is based on our legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order to proceed with the processing of your personal information.

**Data portability:** You may have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. Where possible, we will provide this information in CSV format or other easily readable machine format. You may also have the right to request that we transfer this personal information to a third party.

If you terminate or delete your account, we will delete your personal information within 30 days of the deletion of your account.

Issues raised within the Lioneur community are often confidential and are not common knowledge within the community or within members’ companies. When contacting a Lioneur member about such an issue, please use the utmost circumspection. In particular, use care when talking to Lioneur members’ employees, calling or e-mail to members that may be viewed by other parties, and when leaving voicemail messages in general voicemail boxes.

**Usernames and Passwords**

Access to Lioneur Sites and the information contained therein is to be protected at all times and users must take all necessary safeguards to secure their personal username and password information. Do not share your password with anyone else, if you believe your password may have been lost or stolen please contact the Lioneur Support desk ([\[email protected\]](https://lioneur.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) and we will change it for you.

**Solicitation**

All users of Lioneur Sites agree that the directories and e-mail addresses contained within Lioneur Sites will not be used for solicitation of business by any member of the Lioneur community (including staff). This information may not be used to compile marketing or contact lists of any kind.

**Competition and Hiring**

All members of the Lioneur community agree not to use any non-public information posted on the Sites or shared within the Lioneur community to directly or indirectly, either individually or with others, compete with; solicit customers, employees or business away from;or otherwise cause economic loss to, any other member of the Lioneur community.

**Reminder**

Despite best efforts to ensure confidentiality and security, no site can be guaranteed to be 100% secure 100% of the time. Use caution with all of your Internet transactions.

Although members agree to hold in full confidentiality anything discussed in their group, page, forum meetings, and during one-to-one conversations (online chats), this agreement is not binding on third parties or in a court of law. Members could be compelled to testify on matters discussed in meetings or on Lioneur discussion boards and forums, and Lioneur may be required to disclose information or materials pursuant to applicable laws, regulations, orders, subpoenas or other processes of law. Therefore, members should generally exercise caution when discussing anything in a Lioneur meeting or on a Lioneur discussion board or forum that a member would not want disclosed in any legal proceeding. Furthermore, members of publicly traded companies should seek the advice of their corporate counsel regarding disclosure of any material, non-public information in light of applicable securities laws and regulations.

In addition, because member issue recordings are not ‘privileged’ (i.e., not protected from disclosure under the law), a court could compel Lioneur to release a copy of the issue recording or discussion thereof if a copy of an issue were to be uploaded to a Lioneur web property or if members engaged in a discussion of such an issue in a Lioneur forum or discussion area. Thus, our best practice recommendation is for members to receive their copy of any issue recorded at their meeting because of the possibly sensitive nature of issues.  Similarly, we recommend that discussions of issues containing potentially confidential or sensitive information not take place on Lioneur web properties if the participants wish to keep such discussions privileged.

You acknowledge that Lioneur cannot control, monitor, or be responsible for the conduct of members, Chairs or Speakers or Staff, and that disputes or claims arising out of violations of this Pledge shall remain between the disputing parties without liability to Lioneur.
