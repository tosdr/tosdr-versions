Unless the Subscriber cancels the subscription in accordance with the terms outlined herein, the adjusted prices for the subscribed Service will apply upon renewal for each subsequent Subscription Period.

5.4. All invoices are payable upon presentation and should be paid no later than fifteen (15) calendar days either from the start of subscription period or upon automatic renewal as the case may be, unless otherwise agreed in the Licensing Contract.
