Our Privacy Policy
==================

Last Updated: November 20, 2024

It is our mission to help teachers deliver meaningful learning experiences. To achieve this, we build easy to use tools that help make things simple for teachers and empower them to focus on the important things. It is hence critical that we create a safe and secure environment where teachers, children, and parents freely share content and ideas. Creating such a safe and secure environment is central to the success of our endeavours.

### What is Toddle?

Toddle is one stop solution for educators that seamlessly integrates curriculum planning, portfolios, evidence collection, progress reports and communication. Toddle has a web end as well as a mobile end. The Toddle platform has 4 different types of users - Teachers, Students, Parents, and School Administrators. Below is a brief summary of what each type of user can use the platform for:

**Teachers:** Teachers use Toddle for planning (Unit Plans, Lesson Plans etc), for collecting evidence of learning, for continuous reflection, for assessment evaluation and for contributing to student portfolios.

**Students:** Students use Toddle to document their learning journeys, set their personalised goals, receive and self-evaluate assessments, and add work to their portfolios.

**Parents:** Parents are linked to individual students and can see their portfolios. Parents also get access to school calendar, school news, and school policies through the Toddle Family app. The app can also be used for communicating with teachers.

**Administrators:** Administrators can edit and approve all the academic plans, add, delete and edit the rights of other users from their organisation. They can also see insights for better program implementation.

Toddle AI takes the security of the data seriously. We implement industry-standard measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data we collect and process. Access to the LLMs and the pseudonymized data is restricted to authorized personnel only and we follow the principle of least privilege.

However, to prevent accidental deletion, we will notify the teacher, the school and any other email IDs associated with the account and provide an opportunity to download the data of the abandoned account.

### Viewing, editing or Porting your information

Parents are encouraged to work directly with teachers and school to make any changes in your data. If however, you need to get in touch with us, you can write to [privacy@toddleapp.com](mailto:privacy@toddleapp.com) and we will work with the school and do our best to make the required changes.

If you would like to delete your Toddle account or any content submitted to Toddle, please send an email to [privacy@toddleapp.com](mailto:privacy@toddleapp.com).

### Data Protection Practices

We follow the latest, industry standards to protect your data. Some measures that are in place include use of highly secure, access-controlled data centres, data encryption in transit, and encryption data at rest etc.
