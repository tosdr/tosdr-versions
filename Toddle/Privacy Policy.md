### What is Toddle?

Toddle is one stop solution for educators that seamlessly integrates curriculum planning, portfolios, evidence collection, progress reports and communication. Toddle has a web end as well as a mobile end. The Toddle platform has 4 different types of users – Teachers, Students, Parents, and School Administrators. Below is a brief summary of what each type of user can use the platform for:

**Teachers:** Teachers use Toddle for planning (Unit Plans, Lesson Plans etc), for collecting evidence of learning, for continuous reflection, for assessment evaluation and for contributing to student portfolios.

**Students:** Students use Toddle to document their learning journeys, set their personalised goals, receive and self-evaluate assessments, and add work to their portfolios.

**Parents:** Parents are linked to individual students and can see their portfolios. Parents also get access to school calendar, school news, and school policies through the Toddle Family app. The app can also be used for communicating with teachers.

**Administrators:** Administrators can edit and approve all the academic plans, add, delete and edit the rights of other users from their organisation. They can also see insights for better program implementation.

If you would like to delete your Toddle account or any content submitted to Toddle, please send an email to [privacy@toddleapp.com](mailto:privacy@toddleapp.com).
