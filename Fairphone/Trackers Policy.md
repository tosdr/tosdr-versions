Fairphone Privacy Policy
------------------------

At Fairphone, we’ve got a mission to challenge the tech industry and push for better practices, all based on some core principles we really believe in. And to make that happen, we know transparency is key. So, we’re transparent about everything we do, including our Privacy Policy. We want You to know exactly what’s going on with Your personal information and be able to make informed decisions. That’s why we’ve put together this Privacy Policy, which tells You all about the personal data (meaning any information through which We can, directly or indirectly, identify You by) we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it.

This Privacy Policy applies to the website fairphone.com (including Fairphone webshop, forum, blogs and Fairphone support platform) owned and operated by Fairphone B.V. and the processing by Our devices and My Fairphone App. Apart from the device set-up, Your Fairphone comes with a native application called the My Fairphone App.  
In general We only use Your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use Your personal data in the following circumstances:

* Where you have provided Your (explicit) consent for direct marketing activities whereby Fairphone will proactively notify you e.g. through emails or push-notification. Where consent was required for processing, You can revoke Your consent for future data processing at any time. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of data processing based on the consent before the revocation. In certain cases, we may continue to process Your information after You have withdrawn consent, this would apply when we process the same data for a different purpose or if Your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.
* Where there is a necessity for the performance of our contract with you, e.g. providing warranty service.
* Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and Your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
* Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

Setting up Your Fairphone

Once You start Your device, You will be guided through a series of options for settings. In the below section we explain in more detail what these options entail in terms of data processing. Please note this is applicable to You only if You are operating under the Android Operative System (OS) and not alternative OSes, such as /e.

While we aim to provide You with control over Your personal data and other data sent by Your device to us, some data is required to ensure Your device is secure, up to date, and performing as expected. In addition, this data also allows us to estimate how long a device is used and updated, which is core to Fairphone’s mission to increase the longevity of devices and reduce environmental impact. This data is sent by Your device regardless of the options for settings You have set and is collected on a legitimate interest basis. It includes the following data points:

* IMEI and Serial numbers of devices: This allows us to recognise the device and batch;
* Device activation: it allows us to see the number of devices activated, which helps us provide service to You in a number of ways:
    * Allows us to create a baseline so that we can recognise quality or security issues in devices more quickly;
    * Allows us to see how many of the devices we sold are active in the field, which can be used to determine the correct course of action. For example, does an issue occur in all devices or certain batches, and are the affected devices in the hands of our customers.
    * Allows us to plan spare parts production more effectively to minimise waste at the end of life;
* Software version and model: In combination with the other data points, it allows us to evaluate which devices are running the latest software, which devices require updating and if a security or other software issue issue is specific to a software version.

  

Use the My Fairphone App

Depending on what features of the My Fairphone App You use, we may process different categories of Personal Data about You. This contains:

* First name;
* Last name;
* E-mail address;
* IMEI Number;
* Serial Number of the Device
* Product name and Model (e.g. FP3/FP3+/FP4)
* Device information (operating system and browser used, plugins and fonts installed, screen size; Network Operator; Device Activation date);
* Log information: the time and duration of Your use of the My Fairphone App;
* Any information You provide us.

We collect this data in various ways:

* When You register for the My Fairphone App, the application creates an account in Fairphone’s website system, Auth0 together with Bloomreach.
* When You have a Fairphone Forum account, the My Fairphone App will redirect to the forum where You may sign into Your forum accounts.

* When You create a support ticket in the My Fairphone App, the application creates this ticket in Zendesk. If You have a Zendesk account already, the My Fairphone App will ask You to sign into it.
* We use Google’s Firebase,Google Analytics and Bloomreach for Mobile to analyze My Fairphone App usage.

We use Your data to allow You to set-up an account for the My Fairphone App and grant You access to the different features e.g. customer service questions. Furthermore, this allows us to assess Your problems and provide You with the necessary support and subsequently analyse any customer support request for future training. My Fairphone App also enables Fairphone to improve our services. Where you have provided us with consent, we also collect data for marketing purposes, such as personalisation of content of push-notification so that you only receive information that is relevant for you and Your device.  

  

Notifications from My Fairphone App

You may receive push notifications from the MyFairphone App. These notifications, currently include:

* NPS Survey: This push notification opens a survey on a website hosted by HelloCustomer and Typeform.We send You this one-time notification 30 to 45 days after Your device has been activated so we can ask You some simple questions about Your experience with Fairphone so far.
* Warranty Registration Reminder: This push notification redirects You to the warranty registration page. The unique 5 year warranty for Fairphone 4 requires registration and through these reminders we help ensure You can make use of this warranty extension.
* Longevity Survey: This push notification redirects You to the survey in a Typeform format. The survey collects the answers to the questions along with the Fairphone model, OS version, serial number, at what time the survey has been started, at what time the survey has been finished and the Network ID. We use the responses to the survey to calculate how long our customers intend to use the Fairphone device and what Fairphone can do to improve the longevity of the device.

We use the platform called Bloomreach to trigger the notifications, manage the notification content and analyse this for potential improvements. You can manage Your push notification preferences at any time or deactivate these notifications at any time by turning off the notification settings in the MyFairphoneApp or in the Device Settings of Your Fairphone.

This section does not include push notifications received from the Android Operating System or from Third Party applications.  

  

The Fairbuds App

  
When you use the Fairbuds App:

* The App will not collect any user identifiable information (e.g. login, behaviour tracking);
* The App will include links to the Fairphone website with a UTM tag. This will enable Us to see how many visits Our web pages get from the Fairbuds App whereby We can view whether traffic comes from the iOS or Android version of the App.

**2.2 To improve and personalise Your Fairphone experience.**

  

Invitations to write a review on Trustpilot

We may contact You via email to invite You to review any products and services You received. The purpose of this is to collect Your feedback and make improvements to our product offering. We also want to share Your experience as transparently as possible with other potential customers, which is why we use Trustpilot as a trusted third party. We use an external company, Trustpilot A/S, to collect Your feedback which means that we will share Your name, email address and reference number with Trustpilot. If You want to read more about how Trustpilot processes Your data, You can find [their Privacy Policy here](https://legal.trustpilot.com/for-reviewers/end-user-privacy-terms).

We automate and invite via email all customers that purchase directly from the online shop, this means the vast majority of reviews are automatically labelled “Verified” and shown on our Trustpilot profile page as well as various pages on our website.

Customers who may not have seen or received our email invitation still have the opportunity to go to our Trustpilot profile page and write a review. For these customers, we take additional steps to ensure these types of reviews are real before verifying and displaying them publicly. Any suspicious reviews or reviews which do not represent a genuine buying or service experience are flagged and subject to removal.

We do not use sponsors, incentivise or pay our customers to write reviews as we believe this creates bias and is not a true representation of what our customers think and feel.

We want to continue building trust with our new and existing customers by transparently showcasing what others think about our products and services. Therefore, we process and publish positive and negative reviews. These can be seen on our Trustpilot profile page as well as various pages on our website. We may also use such reviews in other promotional material and media for our advertising and promotional purposes.

Retargeting and other paid media elements

Retargeting, also called remarketing, is a method of reaching out to previous visitors to our website or app, often by displaying ads or sending emails.

We collect the following information:

* Full name;
* Address;
* Email address.

With enhanced conversions for web, first-party customer data such as an email address, name, home address or phone number is captured in Your conversion tracking tags, hashed (hashed in advertising means that you’ll be getting relevant ads while Your data will be protected and anonymized), sent to Google in its hashed form and then used to match Your customers to Google accounts, which were signed-in to when they engaged with one of Your ads. Google will only use the data you shared to provide you services. Google uses encryption and employee access controls to protect Your data from unauthorised access. Google won’t share Your data with other advertisers.

Google users can control how their data is used by adjusting  their ‘Web and App Activity’ settings in [My Activity.](https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols?pli=1) Learn more about how to [see and control Your search activity](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/54068).

_About the data sharing process_

Here are more details about the matching process and how we process the data shared to Google. When using the Google tag:

* Google will always hash any personally identifiable data (for example, email, phone number, first name, surname, street address) prior to the data being sent to Google.
* We only allow tags to share conversion events if sent using an HTTPS protocol, the industry standard for secure data transmission.
* Email, phone number and address matching: For matching based on our customers’ data, Google maintains the email addresses for Google accounts and the corresponding hashed strings. After we’ve uploaded Your data with hashed email addresses, Google Ads will compare each hashed string in Your data with the hashed string of Google accounts. If there’s a match, Google will mark those transaction records as matched.

For Retargerting purposes, We can only upload data from You if you have consented to Your information being used for marketing purposes. If You  withdraw Your consent from any lists (newsletter, customer database, etc), You will be automatically removed from Custom Audiences in any advertising platform.

Google tags, and other advertising providers like Meta or Microsoft Bing allow for custom audiences from our website, which will target all website visitors, or engagers with our content across different advertising platforms.
