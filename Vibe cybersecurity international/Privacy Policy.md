Privacy Policy
==============

Privacy Policy
==============

Our privacy policy is written to help you to understand how VIBE CYBER LLC (VIBEcyber) handles “Personally identifiable information” (PII). PII is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website and apps.

**What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website or apps?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like most websites, vibecyber.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Vibecyber.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our website. From time to time, vibecyber.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our website.

Vibecyber.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Vibecyber.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information to third parties unless legally obliged to do so.

When registering or submitting a form on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, phone number or other details. See below on what happens with that data.

**When do we collect information?**
-----------------------------------

#### On our website:

We collect information from you when you fill out a form or enter information on our site.

#### Nextcloud Apps and Files

Our apps only communicate with your own Nextcloud server and do not send any data to us. The Play Store version of Nextcloud apps equal to or newer than 1.5.0 for Nextcloud, supports push notifications which use the Google servers. However, Google does not have access to the actual notification data. Only a header with a subject is sent via Google, and in encrypted form, and the rest of the content is retrieved directly from your Nextcloud server and **not** sent through Google. The iOS client works in a similar way.

**How do we use your information?**
-----------------------------------

We may use the information we collect from our web site visitors in the following ways:

* To improve our website in order to better serve you.
* If you supply us with an email address, to send periodic emails regarding your interest in our technology, and to follow up after correspondence (live chat, email or phone inquiries).

**How do we protect visitor information?**
------------------------------------------

We only collect names and email addresses from visitors who request access to a whitepaper, and from registered users of our apps.

We may use Malware Scanning.

Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology.

We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information, to maintain the safety of personal information.

**Do we use “cookies”?**
------------------------

We do not use any cookies on our web site.

In the VIBE enabled Nextcloud environment, we only use cookies on our Web Administration Management Console (WMC) for two purposes:

1. Administrator authentication check, and logging of Admin access.
2. For improving the user experience (browser related information). In all cases no user-related data or privacy relevant data is stored. And no username or password are captured or cached.

[Nextcloud cookie policies are described here.](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/gdpr/cookies.html#:~:text=Nextcloud%20only%20stores%20cookies%20needed,be%20sent%20to%20your%20system)

**Third-party disclosure**
--------------------------

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our policies, or protect ours or others rights, property or safety.

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Think aggregated statistics (number of website visitors in a particular month) or trends (e.g. We see an increase in the number of visitors from a particular country, or region).

**Third-party links**
---------------------

We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.

**Contact**
-----------

If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact us at privacy@vibecyber.com

**Privacy Policy Changes**
--------------------------

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and at our sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

**Governing Law**
-----------------

These terms and conditions, and all matters relating directly or indirectly to this Site and our apps shall be construed, interpreted, applied and governed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the United States of America, without regard to its conflicts or choice of law provisions.

**For any inquiry, feedback or complaint please contact:**
