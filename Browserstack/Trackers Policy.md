Cookie Policy
=============

At BrowserStack, we believe in complete transparency when it comes to how we collect and use data related to you. This policy offers detailed information about how and when we use cookies.

#### Does BrowserStack use Cookies?

Yes. As mentioned in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.browserstack.com/privacy), we use cookies to help us deliver the best possible user experience. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies.

#### What is a Cookie?

A cookie is a small file placed onto your browser that enables us to enhance your experience on BrowserStack by remembering your preferences.

#### What types of cookies does BrowserStack use?

We use two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to BrowserStack or interact with our products without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by us when you return to one of our products. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

#### What are cookies used for?

Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit BrowserStack, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that’s in line with your settings. Cookies also make your interactions with BrowserStack faster and more secure. Additionally, cookies allow us to bring you advertising off the BrowserStack website, and bring customized features. As of today, BrowserStack does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.

#### How are cookies used for advertising purposes?

Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. Your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by BrowserStack may also set third party cookies.

Unless you clear these cookies from your browser, we may use this information to:

* provide more relevant, interest-based advertising
* provide aggregate reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads
* improve our products

#### How can I opt out of targeted advertising?

We use the following services for targeted advertising, you can use the links below to opt out.

* [Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/settings/personalization)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/247395082112892)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising/actions-that-showed-interest)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/personalization/)
* [Quora](https://www.quora.com/optout)

Further, Our cookie table lists some of the cookies on our website (set by our products or third parties). Please note that the names of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time. You can opt-out of our advertising cookies here.
