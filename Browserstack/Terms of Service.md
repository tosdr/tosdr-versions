2. #### BROWSERSTACK SERVICES
    
    1. **Access to Services.** Customer will purchase and BrowserStack will provide the specific Services as specified in the applicable Order Form. Customer may access and use these Services during the Subscription Term (as defined below) solely for its own benefit and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Documentation and any scope of use restrictions designated in the applicable Order Form (including any limits on Parallel Tests, Screenshots and Permitted Users, if applicable). As part of its use of the Services and if required, Customer may copy and use the Documentation for Customer’s internal use in connection with the use of the Services.
    2. **Permitted Users**
        1. In General. Use of and access to the Services is permitted by and only by the number of employees of Customer specified in the applicable Order Form (“**Permitted Users**”). If Customer is given passwords to access the Services on BrowserStack’s systems, Customer will require that all Permitted Users keep user ID and password information strictly confidential and not share such information with any unauthorized person. User IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared. User IDs may only be reassigned to a new Permitted User if the prior Permitted User will no longer use the Services. Customer will be responsible for any and all actions taken using Customer’s accounts and passwords.
        2. Contractors and Affiliates. Customer may permit individuals serving as its independent contractors and consultants who are not competitors of BrowserStack (“**Contractors**”) and individual employees, contractors, or consultants of Affiliates (as defined below) to serve as Permitted Users, provided Customer remains responsible for compliance by each such Contractor or Affiliate Permitted User with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any such use of the Services by such Contractor or Affiliate Permitted User is for the sole benefit of Customer.

Trial Subscriptions are permitted solely for Customer’s use to determine whether to purchase a paid subscription to the Services. Certain Trial Subscriptions may include pre-release and beta products (“**Beta Releases**”). Trial Subscriptions may not include all functionality and features accessible as part of a paid Subscription. If Customer does not enter into a paid Subscription Term, this Agreement and Customer’s right to access and use the Services will terminate at the end of the Trial Period. BrowserStack has the right to terminate a Trial Subscription at any time for any reason. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, BROWSERSTACK WILL HAVE NO WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, DATA ARCHIVING, SERVICE LEVEL, OR SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO TRIAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.
3. #### CUSTOMER CONTENT
    
    1. **Rights in Customer Content.** As between the parties, Customer will retain all right, title and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights) that Customer may have in and to the Customer Content as submitted to or accessed through the Services. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer hereby grants to BrowserStack a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works of and display the Customer Content solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services to Customer. For clarity, BrowserStack tests Customer Properties, but does not operate the live Customer Properties run by Customer. Further, BrowserStack Services may include without limitation AI powered capabilities or functionalities. Use of such Services may include technology provided by certain third-party tools, software, or service providers listed [here](https://www.browserstack.com/terms/ai-terms) (collectively referred to as “Third-Party AI Tools”). Customer hereby acknowledges and accepts, unless the Customer opts out, that by using such Services, the terms, and policies of the respective Third-Party AI Tools (subject to any updates) shall apply. Both Parties agree that BrowserStack shall have no liability for any claims, damages, or losses, whether direct or indirect, arising from the use of Third-Party AI Tools, including but not limited to errors, interruptions, or inaccuracies within the Third-Party AI Tool. Customer may opt out of using such Services by changing the Account Settings.
    2. **Storage by BrowserStack.** Upon termination of a test, the Test Environment will be deleted (or, for physical, non-emulated devices, reset to factory settings). As a result, any Customer Content resident in a Test Environment will be deleted after completion of the test. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Customer Content is stored by BrowserStack as follows:
        1. BrowserStack will retain any Screenshots and output (such as reports or log data) created using the Services to allow Customer to access the Screenshots and output for later use by Customer.
        2. If Customer uploads a mobile application for use with the Services, BrowserStack will retain a copy of that application for use by Customer in subsequent tests.
        3. BrowserStack may retain short-term technical backups as part of providing the Services.
        4. BrowserStack will also retain Screenshots along with the captured DOM and associated assets (CSS, images, javascript etc.) used to render the Screenshot in case of its visual testing Service.Any Customer Content will be retained subject to BrowserStack’s data retention policies and confidentiality obligations under this Agreement. Except as set forth above, the Services do not provide a solution for storage of Customer Content or backups. Customer agrees that Customer Content shall include only copies of Customer’s data, and not any data that Customer needs for backup or archival purpose.
    3. **Customer Obligations.**
        1. In General. Customer will ensure that Customer’s use of each Service and all Customer Content is at all times compliant with Customer’s privacy policies and all applicable local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and conventions, including, without limitation, those related to data privacy and data transfer, international communications, and the exportation of technical or personal data. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of all Customer Content. Customer represents and warrants to BrowserStack that Customer has all necessary rights, consents and permissions to collect, share and use all Customer Content as contemplated in this Agreement (including granting BrowserStack the rights in Section 3.1), and that no Customer Content will violate or infringe (i) any third party intellectual property, publicity, privacy or other rights or (ii) any Laws. If specified in the Documentation, Customer will submit certain types of Customer Content (e.g., mobile applications) in the format required by BrowserStack.
        2. No Personal Information. Customer acknowledges that the Services are not designed for use with (and do not require) Personal Information included in Customer Content. Customer specifically agrees not to use the Services to collect, store, process or transmit any Personal Information other than Account-Related Information, and will not submit to the Services any Customer Content containing any Personal Information. BrowserStack will have no liability under this Agreement for Personal Information included within Customer Content, or any security incident or breach regarding such Personal Information, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.
        3. Customer Content Guidelines. Customer will not use the Services with any Customer Content that (i) is deceptive, fraudulent, illegal, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harmful to minors, pornographic, indecent, harassing, hateful, religiously, racially or ethnically offensive, that encourages illegal or tortious conduct or that is otherwise inappropriate in BrowserStack’s discretion; (ii) contains viruses, bots, worms, scripting exploits or other similar materials; or (iii) could otherwise cause damage to BrowserStack or any third party.
    4. **Indemnification by Customer.** Customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless BrowserStack from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to (a) any Customer Content or acts or omissions of Customer that constitute a breach or alleged breach by Customer of Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) or (b) any service or product offered by Customer in connection with or related to the Services. This indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Customer to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all necessary cooperation of BrowserStack at Customer’s expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, BrowserStack may participate in the defense of any claim by counsel of its own choosing, at its cost and expense and Customer will not settle any claim without BrowserStack’s prior written consent, unless the settlement fully and unconditionally releases BrowserStack and does not require BrowserStack to pay any amount, take any action, or admit any liability.
4. #### DATA PROTECTION.
    
    In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), the data protection terms relating to processing of Account-Related Information and Customer Content are contained in Exhibit A (Data Protection Addendum). To the extent that there is any conflict between any provision of the Agreement and the contents of Exhibit A, the contents of Exhibit A shall prevail in respect of such conflict in so far as the matters of data protection are concerned.
    
5. #### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.
    
    BrowserStack is currently in compliance with and shall at all times remain in compliance with the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the Department of the Treasury and any statute, executive order, or other governmental action relating thereto. In accordance with the regulations, BrowserStack does not offer services to users in specific sanctioned regions and hence does not allow users in such regions to access all of certain parts of the website, including certain products. More information about the sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the US Department of the Treasury is available at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/pages/default.aspx. Therefore, Customer and/or its Affiliates agree that they are not from such specific sanctioned regions and are currently in compliance with and will at all times during the Subscription Term of this Agreement remain in compliance with the regulations of OFAC and any statute, executive order, or other governmental action relating thereto.
    
6. #### OWNERSHIP.
    
    1. **BrowserStack Technology.** This is a subscription agreement for access to and use of the Services. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to the Services and that irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale” or like terms in this Agreement no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under this Agreement. Customer agrees that BrowserStack or its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Services, all Documentation, Professional Services deliverables and any and all related and underlying technology and documentation and any derivative works, modifications or improvements of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate Feedback (collectively, “**BrowserStack Technology**”). Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no rights in any BrowserStack Technology are granted to Customer. Further, Customer acknowledges that the Services are offered as an on-line, hosted solution, and that Customer has no right to obtain a copy of any of the Services.
    2. **Feedback.** Customer, from time to time, may submit comments, questions, suggestions or other feedback relating to any BrowserStack product or service to BrowserStack (“**Feedback**”). BrowserStack may freely use or exploit Feedback in connection with any of its products or services without the need to pay compensation for any use of such Feedback.
    3. **Usage Data.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Customer agrees that BrowserStack may obtain technical data about Customer’s use of the Services that is non-personally identifiable with respect to Customer (“**Usage Data**”), and BrowserStack may use the Usage Data to analyze, improve, market, support and operate the Services and otherwise for any business purpose during and after the term of this Agreement. For clarity, this Section 6.3 does not give BrowserStack the right to identify Customer as the source of any Usage Data.
7. #### FEES & PAYMENT
    
    1. **Fees and Payment.** All fees are as set forth in the applicable Order Form and are due within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice . All fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable. BrowserStack shall bill each Customer for sales tax, goods and services (“GST”) or value added (“VAT”) taxes as a separate line item on each invoice, wherever applicable. Customers are required to pay any use, withholding, or similar taxes (including reverse charge with respect to GST and VAT) or levies, whether domestic or foreign as may be applicable, other than taxes based on the income of BrowserStack. Any late payments will be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.  
        BrowserStack may change the fees in effect or add new fees and charges from time to time. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision contained herein (but subject to any applicable law), at the time of any renewal of a subscription, Customer agrees that  BrowserStack  may increase  Customer’s  recurring  fees  up  to  the  greater  of  (i)  the  then  list price as publicly marketed on our website, or (ii) eight percent (8%) for every  12-month  period.  However, any renewal  in  which  subscription volume, units, or subscription length for any Services has decreased from the  immediately  prior  term  will  result  in  re-pricing  at  renewal  without regard to the prior term’s subscription pricing.
    2. **Suspension of Service.** In addition to any of BrowserStack’s other rights or remedies (including but not limited to any termination rights set forth herein), BrowserStack reserves the right to suspend Customer’s access to the Services if: (i) Customer’s account is thirty (30) days or more overdue; (ii) BrowserStack determines that Customer has breached Section 2.3 (General Restrictions) or Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations); or (iii) BrowserStack determines that suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other customers or third parties, or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the Services. BrowserStack will have no liability for taking action as permitted above in this section. However, unless this Agreement has been terminated, BrowserStack will cooperate with Customer to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Customer has resolved the condition requiring suspension.
8. #### TERM AND TERMINATION
    
    1. **Term.** This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date. Either party may terminate this Agreement on written notice if there are no Order Forms in effect. Each Service is provided on a subscription basis for a set term designated on the Order Form and thereafter, will automatically renew for successive terms of equal length to the initial term unless either party provides the other party with written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term (the initial term and each renewal term, a “Subscription Term”).
    2. **Termination for Cause.** Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).
    3. **Effect of Termination.** Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Customer will immediately cease any and all use of and access to all Services (including any and all related BrowserStack Technology) and delete (or, at BrowserStack’s request, return) any and all copies of the Documentation, any BrowserStack passwords or access codes and any other BrowserStack Confidential Information in its possession. Provided this Agreement was not terminated for Customer’s breach, Customer may retain and use internally copies of all reports exported from any Service prior to termination. Customer acknowledges that following termination it will have no further access to any Customer Content input into any Service, and that BrowserStack may delete any such data as may have been stored by BrowserStack at any time. Except where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise of either party of any remedy under this Agreement, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.
    4. **Survival.** The following Sections will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 2.3 (General Restrictions), 2.4 (Trial Subscriptions), 3.2 (Storage by BrowserStack), 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer), 6 (Ownership), 7.1 (Fees and Payment), 8 (Term and Termination), 9.2 (Warranty Disclaimer), 11 (Confidential Information) and 12 (General Terms).
9. #### LIMITED WARRANTY
    
    1. **Limited Warranty.** BrowserStack warrants, for Customer’s benefit only, that each Service will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation. BrowserStack’s sole liability (and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty will be, at no charge to Customer, for BrowserStack to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the reported non-conformity, or if BrowserStack determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and Customer will receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of such Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. The limited warranty set forth in this Section 9.1 will not apply: (i) unless Customer makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which Customer first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the error was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party hardware, software or services, or (iii) to use provided based on a Trial Subscription.
    2. **Warranty Disclaimer.** EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 9.1, ALL SERVICES AND THE BROWSERSTACK CODE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”. NEITHER BROWSERSTACK NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. BROWSERSTACK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT CUSTOMER’S USE OF ANY SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, NOR DOES BROWSERSTACK WARRANT THAT IT WILL REVIEW THE CUSTOMER CONTENT FOR ACCURACY OR THAT IT WILL PRESERVE OR MAINTAIN THE CUSTOMER CONTENT WITHOUT LOSS. BROWSERSTACK WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF BROWSERSTACK. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.
    3. **Specific Disclaimers.** TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BROWSERSTACK IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAYS, DELIVERY FAILURES, OR ANY OTHER LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM (I) THE TRANSFER OF DATA OVER PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE INTERNET, OR (II) ANY DELAY OR DELIVERY FAILURE ON THE PART OF ANY OTHER SERVICE PROVIDER NOT CONTRACTED BY US, AND CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SERVICE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF SUCH COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BROWSERSTACK CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ABSOLUTE PREVENTION OF CYBER-ATTACKS SUCH AS HACKING, SPYWARE, AND VIRUSES. ACCORDINGLY, BROWSERSTACK SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE, LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF CUSTOMER DATA ARISING FROM SUCH RISKS AS LONG AS SUCH RISK CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO NEGLIGANCE OR FAILURE ON BROWSERSTACK’S PART.

    Each party (as “**Receiving Party**”) agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (“**Disclosing Party**”) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (“**Confidential Information**”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any BrowserStack Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of BrowserStack without any marking or further designation. Customer Content will be deemed Confidential Information of Customer without the need for any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.

The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
