1\. SCOPE AND APPLICATION
-------------------------

Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC ("FSIM" or "we") wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets (collectively, the "FSIM Services"). California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below.  Consumers in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and states with other similar privacy laws, please see Section 9 below.   By using FSIM Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  A list of our affiliated companies ("FSIM Affiliates") is available at [www.foxcorporation.com](http://www.foxcorporation.com/).

As set forth in our Terms of Use ([https://www.foxsports.com/terms-of-use](https://www.foxsports.com/terms-of-use)), the FSIM Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. 

This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the FSIM Services without being registered with or subscribing to a FSIM Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a FSIM Service.  This Privacy Policy applies to FSIM’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).  It also describes generally FSIM’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage). 

2\. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
-----------------------------

Depending on your interactions with us, FSIM and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you: 

**Registration Information** is the information you submit to register for a FSIM Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest, sweepstakes or game.  Registration Information may also include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code, favorites, entry name, and birthday. 

**Customer Service and Feedback Information** is the information you submit to request customer support or to provide feedback about FSIM Services, such as name, email address, telephone number, city, and state.

**Public Information and Posts** consist of comments or content that you post to the FSIM Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name/entry name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.  Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.   

**Authenticated Content Access.** To access certain video content via the FSIM Services, you will be redirected to your television content provider’s registration page where you will be required to sign in using your television content provider account. Please contact your television content provider directly with questions concerning your account, including how to access, update and manage your personal account information.

**Activity Information.**  When you access and interact with the FSIM Services, FSIM and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the FSIM Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the FSIM Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.  

Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data.  Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).   FSIM’s websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.  These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the FSIM Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed. 

Other parties that support the FSIM Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate FSIM Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the FSIM Services or other parties’ services.  Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer.  FSIM does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies.  For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled "To deliver relevant advertisements," below.   

Your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage and, depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser.  For more information about Google Analytics, please review the site "How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services," located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). To opt out of Google Analytics specifically, please go to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the FSIM Services.

The FSIM Services that enable you to view FSIM video content may feature Nielsen’s proprietary measurement software which will allow you to contribute to market research, like Nielsen’s TV Ratings. The information is collected directly by Nielsen’s software within the applicable FSIM Service. FSIM makes no representation or warranty to you regarding the Nielsen software.  To learn more about Nielsen’s digital measurement products and your choices in regard to them, including how to opt-out, please visit [https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/).

**Information from Other Sources.**  We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our FSIM Affiliates or business partners.  

Depending on your interactions with us, FSIM may not have collected information from you for each of the categories above.

**‘Do Not Track’.**  At this time we do not respond to the 'Do Not Track' signal, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how the signal should be interpreted.

3\. USE AND DISCLOSURE
----------------------

We may use and disclose some or all of the information we collect from and about you for the following purposes:

**To provide the FSIM Services**. We use information we collect from and about you to provide the FSIM Services. This may include:

* to measure, maintain and improve those FSIM Services and features and to develop new products and services, including conducting research and quality and safety assurance measures;
  
* to improve your experience with both online and off-line FSIM Services by delivering content you will find relevant and interesting, including advertising and marketing messages;
  
* to perform identity verification;
  
* to allow you to comment on content, and participate in online games, contests, other promotions, or rewards programs;
  
* to provide you with customer support and to respond to inquiries; this may include the use of chatbots. Please note that your inquiries and responses to these chatbots may be transcribed and retained.
  
* to make inferences and predictions about your potential areas of interest in order to provide you with content and advertising that is more interesting, personalized, and relevant to you;
  
* to maintain our facilities and infrastructure;

**To allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the FSIM Services.**  Information we collect from and about you may be made available to certain service providers, such as contractors, chatbot providers, analytics and other measurement companies, and agents or sponsors, who help us analyze and understand your use of the FSIM Services, and manage and/or provide the FSIM Services.   

**To deliver video content.** In the ordinary course of our business, we may share information that we collect from or about you with other parties in order to process your requests and fulfill your orders for video content offered through the FSIM Services, including, to provide you with access to localized content and provide video content recommendations. For example, to process your request to view certain authenticated video content through the FSIM Services, we may share information that we collect from and about you with your designated television content provider and/or our service providers in order to authenticate and/or authorize you to view authenticated and/or localized video content through the FSIM Services.

**To provide co-branded services and features.**  We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with other companies ("Co-Branded Services").  These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on FSIM Services or on that other party’s service.  By virtue of these relationships, we may share information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with that party.  That other party’s use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy. 

**To provide leaderboards.** We may include certain information about your participation in certain online games on public leaderboards, including, for example, your entry name, ranking, and game picks.

**To deliver relevant advertisements.**  FSIM and our service providers may use information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy to deliver and measure relevant, more personalized ads to you when you use the FSIM Services or another service (on any of your devices). This may include, for example, sharing email address (in hashed form), IP address, or information about your browser or operating system, with our identity partners. In some instances, these entities may return an online identification code that we may store in a first party cookie, or other similar technology, for our use in online and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. To opt out of this use, please go to [https://privacy.foxsports.com/main/web/main](https://privacy.foxsports.com/main/web/main). As noted above, advertising technology companies and advertisers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and information about the different devices and/or browsers you use and your activity on such devices and browsers, to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests. The information may also be used to deliver more relevant advertising to you across marketing channels, including email. To find out more about advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see [https://youradchoices.com/](https://youradchoices.com/).  If you wish to opt out of tailored advertising in desktop and mobile browsers, please visit [http://optout.aboutads.info/#/](http://optout.aboutads.info/#/) or [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#) on each of your devices and browsers.  To opt out in mobile apps, you may use your device’s setting to opt out of ads personalization or similar settings or download and use the AppChoices app at [https://youradchoices.com/appchoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices). To opt out on connected TVs that support opt-outs, please use the  setting "opt out of ads personalization,"  "Interest-based Ads," or equivalent settings on your device.  Please note that opting-out does not mean that you will stop seeing all ads.  

**To contact you.**  FSIM may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to the FSIM Services.  If you want to stop receiving promotional materials, you can change your FSIM account setting or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.  There are certain service notifications and other non-promotional emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the FSIM Services or policies.  If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.

**To share with our FSIM Affiliates**. FSIM may share information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy with FSIM Affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  A link to a website that lists FSIM Affiliates can be found at the beginning of this policy. Users who visit FSIM Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. 

**To share with business partners**.  FSIM may share information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications consistent with your choices. 

**To protect the rights of FSIM and others.**  There may be instances when FSIM may use or disclose information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy, including situations where FSIM has a good faith belief that such use or disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of FSIM, our FSIM Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the FSIM Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.

Depending on your interactions with us, FSIM may not have collected, used or disclosed information from or about you in each of the categories above, and to the extent that FSIM has disclosed information from or about you, it may not include all of the information that we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Location of Data.**  The FSIM Services are hosted in and managed from the United States.  If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.  The United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.  In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.
