How is Information Collected?
-----------------------------

We collect personal and non-personal information from you when you visit, access, register with, subscribe to or use the Services; when you register for, subscribe to, order or purchase any products and/or services on, through or in relation to the Services; when you “sign in,” “log in,” or the like to the Services; when you allow the Services to access, upload, download, import or export content found on or through, or to otherwise interact with, your computer or mobile device (or any other device you may use to visit, access or use the Services) or online accounts with third-party websites, networks, platforms, servers or applications (e.g., your online social media accounts, your cloud drives and servers, your mobile device service provider); or whenever We ask you for such information, such as, for example, when you process a payment through the Services, or when you answer an online survey or questionnaire, enter a sweepstakes or contest or sign up for a newsletter.

In addition, if you or a third-party sends us a comment, message or other communication (such as, by way of example only, email, letter, fax, phone call, or voice message) about you or your activities on or through the Services, then We may collect any personal or non-personal information provided therein or therewith.

We may also use various tracking, data aggregation and/or data analysis technologies, including, for example, the following:

* Cookies, which are small data files (e.g., text files) stored on the browser or device you use to view a website or message. They may help store user preferences and activity, and may allow a website to recognize a particular browser or device. There are several types of cookies, including, for example, browser cookies, session cookies, and persistent cookies. Cookies may record information you access on one page of a website to simplify subsequent interaction with that website, or to help streamline your transactions on related pages of that website. Most major browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you might be able to adjust your browser’s or device’s preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to block, reject, disable, delete or manage the use of some or all cookies on your browser or device.
* Flash cookies, which are cookies written using Adobe Flash, and which may be permanently stored on your device. Like regular cookies, Flash cookies may help store user preferences and activity, and may allow a website to recognize a particular browser or device. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings that are used for regular cookies.
* Web beacons, which are pieces of code embedded in a website or email to monitor your activity on the website or your opening of the email, and which can pass along information such as the IP address of the computer or device you use to view the website or open the email, the URL page on which the web beacon is located, the type of browser that was used to access the website, and previously set cookie values. Web beacons are sometimes used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Disabling your computer’s, device’s or browser’s cookies or other tracking technology features may prevent some web beacons from tracking or recording certain information about your activities.
* Scripts, which are pieces of code embedded in a website to define how the website behaves in response to certain key or click requests sent by the user. Scripts are sometimes used to collect information about the user’s interactions with the website, such as the links the user clicks on. Scripts are often times temporarily downloaded to the user’s computer or device from the website server, active only while the user is connected to a Site, and deactivated or deleted when the user disconnects from the Services.
* Analytic tools and services, which are sometimes offered by third-parties, and which track, measure and/or generate information about a website’s or program’s traffic, sales, audience and similar information, and which may be used for various reasons, such as, for example, statistical research, marketing research, and content ratings research, and conversion tracking. We may use third party analytics, including Google Analytics. You can opt out from the use of Google Analytics by following the instructed provided at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?
------------------------------------------------

### Our Affiliated Companies

We may share any information that we collect with any company that is directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or operated by DALN, as well as any employees of such companies. This is so that DALN and its affiliated companies can communicate with you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. The use and further disclosure of the information collected through our Services by our affiliated companies will be governed by this Policy.

### Vendors, Service Providers and Provider Partners

We currently have and will continue to have arrangements with third-party vendors and service providers (e.g., credit card processors, shipping companies, fulfillment services, business partners, promotional partners, co-branded sites, etc.) that assist us with the operation and development of our Services. We reserve the right to share with these companies any information we collect, provided that they commit to use personal information only in relation for the services they provide for us or our users.

We might use or share non-personal, anonymized and/or aggregated information with third parties - and we reserve the unencumbered right, but not the obligation, to use or share such information - because such information does not identify you.

In some cases, a vendor or service provider of ours may collect your information on our behalf. Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our Services may also gather information through processes that we do not control. As such, collection of such information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policies.

To make our Services more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features of our Services in conjunction with other unaffiliated companies (“Provider Partners”) that specialize in operating such features. For example, we may offer a car buying service, personalized finance and weather information services, social networking tools, sweepstakes offers, or other promotions through cooperative arrangements with Provider Partners. We share personal information with our Provider Partners as is useful or necessary for them to provide you with the features that they offer through our cooperative arrangement with them. Some of these Provider Partners may also collect personal information in connection with providing their services. Their use of such information will be subject to their own privacy policies and terms of service, which you should review. Please refer to “What Other Parties Might Be Collecting Information When You Use Our Services?” for additional information.

### Other Disclosures

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this Policy or within our Services, we reserve the right to release personal information about our users when we deem such release to be appropriate to comply with law, respond to compulsory process or law enforcement requests, enforce our Terms of Service, or protect the rights, property or safety of our users, the public, DALN, our affiliates, or any third party. Over time, we may reorganize or transfer various assets and lines of business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein or within our Services, we reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we collect to third parties, in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, foreclosure, liquidation, amalgamation, or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance, or financing of all or any portion of DALN or our affiliates.

Our Services may offer social network tools, message boards, chat rooms, or other forums or interactive areas you can use to communicate with other users or to submit and post your own content (such as stories, blogs, photos and videos, and the like).
