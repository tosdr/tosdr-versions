You agree to pay the price that is stated at the time of your order, as well as any applicable taxes. You also agree to the billing frequency stated at the time of your order. Discount eligibility for new members is determined at the time of the order. Discounts cannot be applied retroactively. Introductory discounts are not available to current members or to anyone who has been a member in the past 90 days. All prices are in United States Dollars. The DallasNews reserves the right to change prices and fees at any time. We will notify you in advance if the rate that you will be charged for a membership changes from what was stated at the time of your order. You will have the opportunity to cancel or change your membership at that time. If you do not cancel or change your membership, you will be charged the new membership fee for your next billing period. Unless separately stated when you signed up, prior to the end of each billing period, you will be billed and your membership will auto-renew if it has not been canceled. This will be the start of a new billing period. Applicable taxes may vary. We are not able to notify you in advance of changes in applicable taxes. If a stated price is determined by us in our sole discretion to be in error, we are not under any obligation to offer you the membership at that price. We will notify you of the error and give you the opportunity to cancel your order and obtain a refund if payment has already been made. If you believe someone else has used your account or you are being charged for a product or service that you did not order or you do not have access to, please contact [Customer Service](https://www.dallasnews.com/help/contact-us/).

(b) For details about your membership, including payment methods and billing periods, please call 1-800-925-1500 or log on to the Member Center at [https://myaccount.dallasnews.com](https://myaccount.dallasnews.com/).

Unless specified otherwise in any applicable documentation, all charges are nonrefundable.
