    4. SUBSCRIPTIONS
        
        1. Payment processing for the Products will be performed by one of AllTrails’ third-party payment processors (such processors collectively, “Payment Processor”). Your use of the payment processing provided by the Payment Processor may be subject to additional terms, as provided by the Payment Processor processing your respective transaction and as may be modified by such Payment Processor from time to time (collectively, the “Payment Processor Agreement”). As a condition of using the Payment Processor’s payment processing, you must provide accurate and complete information in connection with such payment processing, and you authorize us to share this information with the Payment Processor and to charge your Payment Method for all amounts that may become due under this Agreement. All bank, credit card, debit card or other payment information is sent directly to and stored by the Payment Processor using its security protocols. AllTrails does not store your payment information on its systems and shall not have any responsibility for the safety or security of that information. Your use of the Payment Processor’s payment processing is conditioned upon your compliance with the Payment Processor Agreement, and if the Payment Processor Agreement is terminated by the Payment Processor, you may not be able to purchase a Subscription (as defined below), or you may have your use of the Products suspended or terminated. We may change or add other payment processing services at any time upon notice to you, which may be subject to additional terms or conditions.
            
        2. AllTrails users may access the Products in three ways:
            
            1. Browsing the Website or using the Apps without creating a Member Account. We make certain features and information available to users without creating a Member Account. Such users are still subject to these Terms and any applicable Supplemental Terms.
                
            2. Free AllTrails Member Account. Certain additional information and many Product features are available to holders of free Member Accounts. All Members are subject to these Terms and any applicable Supplemental Terms.
                
            3. Paid AllTrails+ Subscription. We offer a subscription fee-based program, which gives you access to certain premium Products for which access and use is purchased on a time-limited basis (each, a “**Subscription**”).
                
            
            You can purchase a Subscription through the Website or within the Apps in accordance with the functionality of such Products. If you purchase a Subscription through the Website, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the AllTrails+ service, email [support@alltrails.com](mailto:support@alltrails.com) within 30 days of your initial Order and provide all details requested related to your Order and we will cause our Payment Processor to initiate a refund to the credit card or other approved payment method (“**Payment Method**”) with which you placed the Order. PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL SUBSCRIPTIONS PURCHASED THROUGH THE APPLE APP STORE, GOOGLE PLAY STORE, OR OTHERWISE THROUGH THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR APPS (EACH, A “**DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL**”) ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SUCH DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL, AND ANY REFUND REQUEST MUST BE ADDRESSED TO THE RELEVANT DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL. Your Order through the Apple App Store will be subject to Apple’s then-current payment policy, which may not provide for refunds. Your Order through the Google Play Store will be subject to Google’s applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds. You agree to immediately notify us and/or the applicable Distribution Channel of any change in your billing address or other payment information. Your Payment Method agreement governs your use of the designated Payment Method, and you must refer to that agreement to determine your rights and liabilities thereunder. These Terms are between you and AllTrails only, and not with the applicable Distribution Channel or any other third parties. To the extent that you utilize any other third party products and services in connection with your use of the Products, you agree to comply with all applicable terms of any agreement for such third party products and services. In no event will AllTrails be responsible for the actions or inactions of any third party, including any Distribution Channel, Payment Processor, or Payment Method, including but not limited to system downtime or payment service outages, and any billing or fee disputes related thereto are between you and such Distribution Channel, Payment Processor, or Payment Method.
            
        3. The fee for a Subscription is billed at the start of the Initial Term and subject to automatic renewal. By providing our Payment Processor or the App Store or other marketplace from which you purchase a Subscription with your Payment Method, you acknowledge and agree that our Payment Processor and/or such App Store or marketplace, as applicable are authorized to charge your Payment Method for all charges due and payable under your Member Account, including:
            
            1. Fees for the Initial Term at the rate secured at the time of purchase;
                
            2. Fees for any Subscription term after the Initial Term (each, a “**Renewal Term**”). After your Initial Term, and again after any subsequent Renewal Term, your Subscription will automatically renew on the first day following the end of such period (each a “**Renewal Commencement Date**”) and continue for an additional equivalent period at AllTrails’ then-current price for such Subscription. **You acknowledge and agree that you may be subject to this automatic renewal feature (even if you otherwise terminate your Member Account) unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the Renewal Commencement Date as set forth in Section 3.4(f) or in accordance with any agreement between you and the Distribution Channel through which you purchased the Subscription, if applicable.** If you do not cancel your Subscription before the Renewal Commencement Date, your Payment Method will be charged for a Subscription for the Renewal Term. If your Subscription was purchased through the Website, and you mistakenly renewed your Subscription, email [support@alltrails.com](mailto:support@alltrails.com) within 30 days of your Renewal Commencement Date and we may refund your renewal payment. Refunds cannot be claimed for any partial subscription period after the first 30 days from any such renewal. Please note that if your Subscription is renewed through the Apple App Store or our iPhone application, the sale is final, and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Apple’s applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds. If your Subscription is renewed through the Google Play Store, the sale is final and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Google’s applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds.
                
            3. Free Trials and Other Promotions. Certain Subscription offerings may be available on a free trial or other promotional basis (a “**Promotional Offer**”), the period of which will be communicated to you via the Products. Unless otherwise expressly set forth, your use of any such Subscription will expire at the end of the Promotional Offer period, and any further use of such Products is prohibited unless you purchase a Subscription to such Products. To the extent expressly indicated at the time of signing up for a Promotional Offer, your Promotional Offer may automatically convert to a paid Subscription and your Payment Method will be charged for the applicable Subscription at the expiration of your Promotional Offer unless you cancel the Subscription in accordance with Section 3.4(f) before the Promotional Offer ends. If you fail to cancel the Subscription before the Promotional Offer ends, you will be responsible for payment for the full term of the Subscription period. Unless otherwise expressly stated, any Promotional Offer must be used within the specified time of such promotion. Any promotion code or offer provided by us may not be used in conjunction with any other promotion code or offer, past or present. Introductory offers are only available to new users of the Products, except where expressly stated otherwise. Unless otherwise set forth in the terms of any promotion, all pricing promotions or discounts will apply to the Initial Term, and any renewals will be charged at the rate in effect at the time of renewal for the type of Subscription purchased.
                
        4. Our multi-year Subscriptions are paid for by an upfront one-time payment and the Subscription term will end after the period indicated when you purchased such Subscription. Multi-year Subscriptions are not subject to automatic renewal terms.
            
        5. If you have purchased a Subscription designated a “Lifetime Subscription,” such Subscription and your access to the Products will terminate the sooner of (i) one hundred (100) years from the date of purchase of such Subscription or (ii) AllTrails ceasing to commercially offer the Products to which you have subscribed.
            
        6. If your Subscription was purchased through the Website, you may cancel automatic renewals of a Subscription purchased through the Website at any time prior to the Renewal Commencement Date in your Member Account at AllTrails.com, or by emailing [support@alltrails.com](mailto:support@alltrails.com). Please note that if you purchase a Subscription through the Apple App Store, you may cancel automatic renewals by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Apple Account settings and selecting the Subscription you want to modify, or otherwise in accordance with the current functionality of that platform. If you purchase a Subscription through the Google Play store, you may cancel automatic renewals in account settings under Subscriptions in the Google Play app, or according to the then-current process outlined by Google Play, or otherwise in accordance with the current functionality of that platform.
            
        7. You are responsible for all applicable fees and charges incurred by your Member Account, including applicable taxes and all Subscriptions purchased by you.
            
        8. The Payment Processor may receive and implement updated credit card or debit card information from your credit card issuer in order to prevent your Subscription from being interrupted by an outdated or invalid card. This disbursement of the updated credit card information is provided to the Payment Processor at the sole election of your credit card issuer. Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt-out of the update service. Should you desire to do so, please contact your credit card or debit card issuer.
            
        9. Our obligation to provide any Products that you have ordered through the Website pursuant to a Subscription only comes into being when we confirm your purchase to you by email. We shall confirm your Order and send you an email to confirm your access to the Subscription purchased. Please quote the Order number in all subsequent correspondence with us related to such Order.
            
        10. Prices in US Dollars include applicable sales taxes. All prices in Euros or Pound Sterling include VAT or equivalent applicable sales taxes. You agree not to hold us responsible for any banking charges or other fees incurred due to payments on your Member Account. If payment is not received by us from the Payment Method you provided pursuant to an Order, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us.
            
    5. DEVICE REQUIREMENTS
        
        The Products include certain services that are available via a mobile device, including (i) the ability to browse the Website from a mobile device and (ii) the ability to access certain features through an App downloaded and installed on a Device (collectively, the “**Mobile Services**”). To the extent you access the Products through a Device, your wireless service carrier’s standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices.
        
    6. CHANGING FEES AND CHARGES
        
        We may at any time and from time to time, in our sole discretion, change the fees and charges, or add new fees and charges, in relation to any of the Products. We will notify you at least 30 calendar days in advance of any such change. Your continued use of the Products after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. Any changes in our fees and charges will not affect any ongoing Subscription until the next Renewal Commencement Date. If you do not agree to the change, you may cancel your membership or Subscription in your account settings or by emailing [support@alltrails.com](mailto:support@alltrails.com).
        
4. **PROHIBITED USE OF THE PRODUCTS**

        You agree not to: (i) upload, post, email or otherwise send or transmit or introduce any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, harm, damage, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or equipment linked directly or indirectly with the Products or the Products themselves; (ii) interfere with the servers or networks underlying or connected to the Products or to violate any of the procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the Products; (iii) access the Products in an unauthorized manner; (iv) interfere with any other user’s use and enjoyment of the Products; (v) request or offer to perform a request that is illegal or violates any of the terms set forth herein; (vi) impersonate any person or entity, including any employee or representative of AllTrails; or (vii) use software or automated agents or scripts to produce multiple Member Accounts, or to generate automated searches, requests, or queries to (or to strip, scrape, or mine data from) the Products (provided, however, that we may conditionally grant to the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy Materials from the AllTrails Products for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the Materials, but not caches or archives of such Materials, subject to the parameters set forth in our robots.txt file).
        
    2. Trespass
        
        You agree that in connection with your use of the Products, you will not trespass on, or in any manner attempt to gain or gain access to any property or location where you do not have a right or permission to be (“Private Property”). You acknowledge that AllTrails does not have and affirmatively disclaims any obligation or ability to provide you with complete and accurate information regarding the whereabouts of Private Property you may encounter when using or in connection with your use of the Products. Regardless of whether AllTrails designates any content with a warning regarding its proximity to Private Property, you are solely responsible for obtaining all required permissions to approach or enter Private Property in connection with your use of the Products.

        You agree not to impersonate any other person while using the Products, conduct yourself in an offensive manner while using the Products, or use the Products for any illegal, immoral or harmful purpose.
        
    5. Reporting for and Release of Liability for Product Misuse:
        
        By breaching the provisions of this Section 4, you may commit a criminal offense under applicable laws. We reserve the right, subject to our obligations under applicable privacy laws, to report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and we may cooperate with those authorities in any investigation related to your use of the Products, including by disclosing your identity to them. In the event of such a breach, your right to use the Products will cease immediately.

If you are a California resident, you also waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

    6. APPLICABLE CONSUMER LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS SET OUT THEREIN, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    1. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE) WILL ALLTRAILS PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING COSTS DUE TO LOSS OF PRODUCTION OR USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS, YOUR ORDERS, OR OTHERWISE, IN EACH CASE WHETHER OR NOT ALLTRAILS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALLTRAILS PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS FOR ANY AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS THE GREATER OF (i) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO ALLTRAILS FOR ANY ALLTRAILS PRODUCTS OR SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO THE CLAIM OR (ii) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).

    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless AllTrails and its directors, officers, members, investors, managers, employees and agents (the “**AllTrails Parties**”) from any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising in any way from your use of the Products, your placement or transmission of any message, content, information, software, or other submissions through the Products, or your breach or violation of the law or of these Terms. AllTrails reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate fully with AllTrails’ defense of such claim. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.
    
13. **DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT**
    
    1. We are committed to complying with copyright and related laws, and we require all users of the Products to comply with these laws.

    2. Owners of copyrighted works in the United States who believe that their rights under copyright law have been infringed may take advantage of certain provisions of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “**DMCA**”) to report alleged infringements.
        
    3. If you feel that any Materials or User Material are infringing your copyright rights, we encourage you to contact us immediately.

14. **GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS**
    
    1. TERM AND TERMINATION
        
        1. You and AllTrails agree that, subject to any eligibility requirements for accessing and using the Products or entering into the Terms, the Terms commenced on the earlier to occur of: (i) the date you first used the Products or (ii) the date you accepted the Terms, and the Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use the Products, unless earlier terminated in accordance with these Terms.
            
        2. We may terminate these Terms or your ability to access or use any or all Products at any time for any reason, with or without notice, including if timely payment cannot be charged to your Payment Method for any reason, if you have breached any provision of the Terms, or if AllTrails is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Products is, or becomes, unlawful).
            
        3. If you want to terminate these Terms, you must do so by (i) notifying AllTrails at any time; (ii) cancelling all of your Subscriptions in accordance with Section 3.4(f); and (iii) closing your Member Account. These Terms will remain in effect until the end of the then-current term of any and all or your Subscriptions. UPON ANY APPLICABLE TERMINATION, YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE SET FORTH IN SECTION 3.4(f).
            
    2. NO WAIVER
        
        If we delay exercising or fail to exercise or enforce any right available to us under these Terms, such delay or failure does not constitute a waiver of that right or any other rights under these Terms.
        
    3. FORCE MAJEURE
        
        AllTrails shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, pandemics, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.

    7. INTERNATIONAL USERS
        
        The Products can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to services and content that are not available in your country. These references do not imply that AllTrails intends to announce such services or content in your country. The Products are controlled and offered by AllTrails from its facilities in the United States of America. AllTrails makes no representations that the Products are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Products from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.
        
    8. U.S. USERS ONLY – ARBITRATION
        
        PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS (THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY, AS THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH ALLTRAILS, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ALLTRAILS. THIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE EEA OR THE UK, OR IF OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
        
        1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Products that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and AllTrails are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
            
        2. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address. In the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by AllTrails. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse AllTrails for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
            
        3. Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and AllTrails. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and AllTrails.
            
        4. Jury Trial Waiver. You and AllTrails waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Rather, you and AllTrails elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and AllTrails over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and AllTrails waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
            
        5. Class Action Waiver. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND ALLTRAILS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor AllTrails are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 14.9 below.
            
        6. Opt-out. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. To opt-out, you must notify AllTrails in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your Member Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement.

    9. EXCLUSIVE VENUE
        
        To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, both you and AllTrails agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. You and AllTrails consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts. If you have your habitual residence in the EEA or the UK, this Section does not apply to you and you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer rights in connection with these Terms in your country of residence.
        
    10. CHOICE OF LAW
        
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort claims. If you have your habitual residence in the EEA or the UK, you may benefit from additional rights and protection afforded to you by mandatory provisions of the laws of your country of residence, and nothing in these Terms shall affect the enforceability of these additional rights and protection.
        
    11. CONSUMER COMPLAINTS
        
        In accordance with California Civil Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
        
    12. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS
        
        AllTrails provides the Products, including any related software, data, and technology, for ultimate government end use solely in accordance with the following: The Products shall constitute “commercial” computer software. Government technical data and software rights related to the Products include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in these Terms. These customary commercial licenses are provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and FAR 12.212 (Customer-Side Application) and, for Department of Defense transactions, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data – Commercial Items) and DFAR 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Customer-Side Application or Computer Customer-Side Application Documentation). If a government agency has a need for rights not granted under these Terms, it must negotiate with AllTrails to determine if there are acceptable terms for granting those rights, and a mutually acceptable written addendum specifically granting those rights must be included in any applicable agreement. If any law, rule or regulation requires these Terms to include a specific provision or clause in order to render these Terms enforceable against any ultimate government end user, such provision or clause will be deemed to be a part of these Terms.
        
    13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
        
        These Terms constitute the whole agreement between us and supersede all previous discussions, correspondence, negotiations, previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between us relating to their subject matter. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. These Terms are between you and us; no other person shall have any rights or obligations pursuant to these Terms. Neither of you or AllTrails is an agent, employee, or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without AllTrails’ prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. AllTrails may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.
        
    14. CONTACT

15. **SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS**
    
    1. APP TERMS
        
        1. **Application License**. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, AllTrails grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install and use a copy of each App on any mobile device or computer that you own or control and to run such copy of each App solely for your own personal or internal business purposes. Furthermore, with respect to any App accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “**App Store Sourced Application**”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (a) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (b) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service. Notwithstanding the first sentence in this section, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Google Play store (a “**Google Play Sourced Application**”), you may have additional license rights with respect to use of the Apps on a shared basis within your designated family group. You understand that the Products are evolving. As a result, we may require you to accept updates to any of the Products that you have installed on your computer or mobile device. You acknowledge and agree that we may update the Products with or without notifying you. You may need to update third-party software from time to time in order to use the Products.
            
        2. **Accessing and Downloading the Application from iTunes**. The following applies to any App Store Sourced Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store:
            
            1. You acknowledge and agree that (i) these Terms are concluded between you and AllTrails only, and not Apple, and (ii) AllTrails, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App Store Sourced Application and content thereof. Your use of the App Store Sourced Application must comply with the App Store Terms of Service.
                
            2. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App Store Sourced Application.
                
            3. In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App Store Sourced Application to you and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. As between AllTrails and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of AllTrails.
                
            4. You and AllTrails acknowledge that, as between AllTrails and Apple, Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
                
            5. You and AllTrails acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between AllTrails and Apple, AllTrails, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms.
                
            6. You and AllTrails acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
                
            7. Without limiting any other terms of the Terms, you must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application.
                
    2. GIFTING
        
        You may be able to purchase certain pre-paid Subscriptions for other users or potential users (“Gift Subscriptions”). A user who purchases a Gift Subscription (a “Giftor”) must designate a specific recipient at the time of purchase, who will receive and has the option to redeem a Gift Subscription (“Recipient”) for a Subscription to certain Products. The Initial Term of such Subscription commences on the date that the Gift Subscription is redeemed for a Subscription. All fees and charges related to Gift Subscriptions are incurred and charged as a one-time payment at the time of the Giftor’s Order of such Gift Subscription. A Giftor may specify the date on which a Gift Subscription will be delivered to the Recipient. The Giftor will receive an Order confirmation and receipt. The Gift Subscription will be sent to the Recipient on the date specified by the Giftor, and is valid to be redeemed for a Subscription during the term specified at point of purchase (the “Expiration Period”). If there was no Expiration Period specified at point of purchase or the Gift Subscription was purchased before October 16, 2021, such Gift Subscription will not expire. A Gift Subscription can only be redeemed once, is not transferable, and may only be used in the country for which it was purchased. A Gift Subscription cannot be redeemed for cash, resold, or combined with any other offers. Our Payment Processor will charge the Payment Method provided by the Giftor at the time of purchase, and not delivery, for any Gift Subscriptions. Neither Giftor nor Recipient is eligible for any refund or other credits arising out of or related to a Gift Subscription that is not redeemed in accordance with these Terms. AllTrails will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Recipient prior to the expiration of the Gift Subscription. Please ensure that you enter the Recipient’s information accurately when purchasing a Gift Subscription. AllTrails is not responsible if a Gift Subscription is lost, stolen or used without permission.
        
    3. LIVE SHARE FUNCTIONALITY
        
        The Products allow an individual user (an “**Originator**”) to create a shared group through which you can make your scheduled activities or current safety status available (the “Live Share Functionality”, also referred to as “Lifeline Functionality”) to a select group of individuals (a “Live Share Notification Group”). To create a Live Share Notification Group, the Originator may invite other individuals to join a Live Share Notification Group by sharing a link with them. The link may be shared by SMS, MMS, text message, email, or any other electronic means at the Originator’s discretion. Upon clicking the link, the invited individual(s), known as Safety Contacts, will be prompted to enter their phone number in order to receive live updates. By doing so, the Safety Contact agrees to receive SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means, sent through the Products. All information shared with AllTrails through a Live Share Notification Group will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy. **ALLTRAILS MAKES NO REPRESENTATION NOR WARRANTY THAT YOUR LIVE SHARE NOTIFICATION GROUP WILL RECEIVE ANY STATUS SAFETY UPDATES SENT THROUGH THE LIVE SHARE FUNCTIONALITY. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE LIVE SHARE FUNCTIONALITY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MOBILE OR GPS SERVICE. IN AN EMERGENCY, CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES IN YOUR JURISDICTION.**
        
    4. REFERRALS
        
        You may be able to use certain features of the Products to refer AllTrails to a third party (a “**Referral**”). When you make a Referral, you may be prompted to enter the name and contact information, including mobile phone number or email address, of the third party to whom you are making the Referral. You represent that you have the right to provide us with such information, and that you provide the information solely in order to make such Referral and not for any other purpose, including harassment, stalking, or other purpose in violation of any applicable laws, regulations, or these Terms. We will use any information that you provide to us in connection with a Referral in accordance with our Privacy Policy. For each individual who creates a new Member Account in connection with their receipt of a Referral, AllTrails shall cause a tree to be planted in connection with our third-party partner.
