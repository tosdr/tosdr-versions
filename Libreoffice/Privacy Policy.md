I.II General information about data processing
----------------------------------------------

### 1.2.1 Extent of the processing of personal data

We collect and use personal information from our users only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website, content and services. The collection and use of personal data from our users takes place only with the consent of the user. An exception applies to cases in which prior consent can not be obtained for factual reasons, and processing the data is permitted by law.

### 1.2.2 Legal basis for the processing of personal data

When we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.

When processing personal data necessary for completing a contract, in which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b of the GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual actions.

When the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our foundation is subjected, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.

In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.

If processing is necessary to safeguard the factual interests of our foundation or a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh those interests, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.

### 1.2.3 Deletion of data and storage duration

The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the reason for storage expires. In addition, data storage may occur when required by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. Restriction or deletion of data also occurs when a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for longer storage of the data, for entering or fulfilment of a contract.

I.III Accessing the website and creation of log files
-----------------------------------------------------

### 1.3.1 Description and extent of data processing

Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the requesting computer. The following data is collected:

2. The user's operating system;
    
3. The user's IP address;
    
4. The date and time of access;
    
5. Websites from which the user's system reaches our website;
    
6. Websites that are accessed by the user's system through our website.
    

The data is also stored in our systems' log files. Storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not occur.

### 1.3.2 Legal basis for data processing

The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR.

### 1.3.3 Reason for data processing

Temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to deliver the website to the user's computer. To do this, the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.

Storage in log files occurs to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data is used to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. Analysis of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.

For these purposes, our factual interest in the processing of data is according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR.

### 1.3.4 Duration of storage

The data will be deleted as soon as it is not needed to achieve the purposes for which it was collected. In the case of data collection used to providing the website, this takes place when the respective session is completed.

For data storage in log files, this takes place after fourteen days at the latest. Longer storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or obfuscated, so that linking the data to the requesting client is no longer possible.

### 1.3.5 Option to object and remove data

The collection of data for accessing the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. There is consequently no option for users to opt-out of this data collection.

I.VIII Web analytics via Matomo
-------------------------------

### 1.8.1 Extent of processing of personal data

On our website, we use the open-source software tool Matomo (formerly Piwik) to analyse the browsing behaviour of our users. This software creates a cookie on the computer of the users (for details about cookies, see above). When individual pages of our website are accessed, the following data is stored:

1. Two bytes of the IP address of the user's system
    
2. The website that is accessed
    
3. The website which led the user to access our website (referrer)
    
4. The subpages that accessed from the website that was accessed
    
5. The session duration on the website (how long the user accesses it)
    
6. How often the website is accessed
    

The software runs exclusively on our website's servers. Storage of personal data only takes place there. Transfer of the data to third parties does not take place.

The software is configured such that the IP addresses are not stored completely, but two bytes of the IP address are masked (eg 192.168.xxx.xxx). In this way, it is no longer possible to associate the shortened IP address with the requesting computer.

### 1.8.2 Legal basis for the processing of personal data

The legal basis for processing users' personal data is Article 6 (1) lit. f of the GDPR.

### 1.8.3 Reason for data processing

The processing of users' personal data enables us to analyse the browsing behaviour of our users. By analysing the obtained data, we are able to compile information about the use of individual parts of our website. This helps us to constantly improve our website and its user-friendliness. For these purposes, our factual interest lies in the processing of the data according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR. The anonymisation of the IP address takes into account the interests of users regarding protection of their personal data.

### 1.8.4 Duration of storage

I.XII Integration of third party services
-----------------------------------------

### 1.12.1 Type and extent

Our websites use third party services. They are integrated dynamically into web pages. These services can set cookies from the respective providers on your computer, and also execute JavaScript code.

#### 1.12.1.1 Use of Google Maps

On our websites, we use the "Google Maps" component from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereafter referred to as "Google".

Each time Google Maps is accessed, Google sets a cookie to process user settings and data when viewing the page that has the Google Maps component integrated. This cookie is usually not deleted by closing the browser, but it will expire after a certain amount of time unless it is manually deleted by you.

If you disagree with the processing of your data, you may disable the "Google Maps" service and prevent the transmission of data to Google in this way. To do this, you must disable the JavaScript feature in your browser. However, please note that in this case you will not be able to use "Google Maps" at all, or only to a limited extent.

Use of "Google Maps" and information obtained through "Google Maps" is subject to the Google Terms of Use:

http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/terms/regional.html

and the additional terms and conditions for "Google Maps":

https://www.google.com/intl/de\_de/help/terms\_maps.html.

#### 1.12.1.2 Use of reCAPTCHA

To protect data entry forms on our websites, we use the service "reCAPTCHA" from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereafter referred to as "Google". Through the use of this service, it can be determined whether the corresponding input is from a human, or the form is being abused by automated machine processing.

To our knowledge, the following are transferred to "Google": referrer URL, the IP address, the behaviour of the website visitors, information about the operating system, browser and duration, cookies, presentation instructions and scripts, the input behaviour of the user and mouse movements in the "reCAPTCHA" checkbox.

Among other things, Google uses this information to digitize books and other printed materials, as well as to optimize services such as Google Street View and Google Maps (eg house number and street name recognition).

The IP address submitted as part of "reCAPTCHA" will not be merged with any other data provided by Google, unless you are logged in to your Google Account at the time you use the "reCAPTCHA" plug-in. If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data about you and your behaviour on our website by "Google", you must log out of "Google" before you visit our site or use the reCAPTCHA plug-in.

Use of the information obtained by the "reCAPTCHA" service is in accordance with the Google Terms of Use:

https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/.

#### 1.12.1.3 Use of Twitter Recommendation Component

We use components from the Twitter service on our websites. Twitter is a service of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States.

Each time you visit our websites which contain such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component of Twitter. Through this process, Twitter is informed about which specific page of our website is currently being visited.

We have no control over the information that Twitter collects here, nor about the amount of data collected by Twitter. To the best of our knowledge, Twitter collects the URL of the respective website and the user's IP address, but it is not used for purposes other than the presentation of the Twitter component. Further information can be found in the privacy policy of Twitter at http://twitter.com/privacy.

You can change your privacy settings in the Account Settings at http://twitter.com/account/settings.

#### 1.12.1.4 Use of YouTube components with advanced privacy mode

On our websites, we use components (videos) from the company YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry Ave., 94066 San Bruno, CA, a company of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

Here we use the option provided by YouTube "- extended privacy mode -".

#### 1.12.1.5 Use of Vimeo components

We use components of the Vimeo service on our website. Vimeo is a service of Vimeo LCC, 555 West 18th Street, NY, New York 10011, USA. Each time you visit a web page which has such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component from Vimeo. When you visit our site and you are logged in to Vimeo, Vimeo recognises, through the information gathered by the component, which specific site you are visiting and assigns this information to your personal Vimeo account. If, for instance, you click the "Play" button or leave a comment, this information will be transmitted to your personal Vimeo account and stored there. In addition, the fact that you have visited our site is passed on to Vimeo. This happens regardless of whether you, for instance, click on the component, or leave comments, or not.

If you wish to stop this transmission and storage of data about you and your behaviour on our website through Vimeo, you must log out of Vimeo before you visit our site. The privacy notices of Vimeo provide more detailed information, in particular for the collection and use of data by Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/privacy

#### 1.12.1.6 Use of social media buttons with "Shariff"

We use the c't project "Shariff" on our website. "Shariff" replaces the usual social media sharing buttons, thereby protecting browsing behaviour.

Only then will your data be transmitted to the respective social network. If the Shariff button is not clicked, there will be no exchange between you and the social networks. More information about the c't project "Shariff" can be found at http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Shariff-Social-Media-Buttons-mit-Datenschutz-2467514.html

### 1.13.6 Right to data portability

You have the right to receive personal data that you provided to the controller in a structured, standard and machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to transfer this data to another person without interference by the controller who was provided the personal data, so long as

1. the processing is based on consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a of the GDPR, or on a contract according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b of the GDPR and
    
2. the processing is done using automated procedures.
    

In exercising this right, you also have the right that your personal data is transmitted directly from one controller to another, insofar as this is technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons may not be affected.

If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes.

Regardless of Directive 2002/58/EC, you have the option, in the context of the use of information society services, to exercise your right to object utilising automated procedures that use technical specifications.

### 1.13.8 Right to revoke the data protection consent declaration

You have the right to revoke your data protection consent declaration at any time. The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent, until the revocation.

### 1.13.9 Right to complain to a supervisory authority

If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates the GDPR, you have the right, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, to complain to a supervisory authority, in particular in the member Member State of your residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement.

The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been submitted shall inform the complainant of the status and results of the complaint, including the option of a judicial remedy pursuant to Art. 78 of the GDPR.
