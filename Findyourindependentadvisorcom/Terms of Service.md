These advisors custody with Schwab Advisor Services™ and were not compensated for their comments. Schwab paid travel-related costs.

The Independent Difference campaign is brought to you compliments of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. The sole purpose of this campaign is to help educate investors about working with an RIA. Clients should evaluate an RIA based on their own particular needs.

Each Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) in the Directory is responsible for the content of its own listing, has voluntarily agreed to be included, and does not pay or receive any compensation from Schwab to include their listing in the Directory. However, Schwab does benefit from RIAs opening client accounts and maintaining their client accounts with Schwab. RIAs may have multiple listings if they operate from multiple office locations.

Schwab Advisor Services serves independent investment advisors and includes the custody, trading, and support services of Schwab. Independent investment advisors are not owned by, affiliated with, or supervised by Schwab. Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (“Schwab”), Member SIPC., is a separate but affiliated company and subsidiary of The Charles Schwab Corporation.
