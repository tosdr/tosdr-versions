### Privacy Online

Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. is the owner and operator of this website. When you interact with Schwab through websites and mobile applications owned and controlled by Schwab (the "Schwab Websites"), Schwab handles personal information in accordance with the practices and safeguards described in our [Privacy Policy](http://www.schwab.com/privacy).

We use cookies and similar technologies on Schwab-owned websites. Cookies are bits of data that a website sends to a web browser on a visitor's computer. Cookies help us to collect information about you and other visitors to Schwab-owned websites, including date and time of visit, pages viewed, amount of time spent on our sites, or general information about the device used to access the site. Cookies are also used for security purposes and to personalize your experience, such as customizing your screen layout.

You can refuse or delete cookies. Most browsers and mobile devices offer their own settings to manage cookies. If you refuse a cookie when on a Schwab-owned website, or if you delete cookies, you may lose functionality. We may not be able to recognize you, your device, or your online preferences.

### How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

Some internet browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference (the "DNT Signal") to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT Signals, nor a common definition of "tracking", we do not currently respond to DNT Signals on the Schwab Websites. Schwab engages in so-called online behavioral advertising on third-party sites (also sometimes called "retargeting" or "tracking"), through which information collected about the pages you visit on findyourindependentadvisor.com is used to display ads to support or promote registered investment advisories on third-party websites. This information may uniquely identify a browser but is not personally identifiable.

### Online Behavioral Advertising

Schwab may use third-party online advertising companies to provide you with advertisements about registered investment advisories that may be relevant to your interests, as determined by your activity on findyourindependentadvisor.com This type of ad customization is known as "online behavioral" or "interest-based" advertising. These advertising companies may use cookies to understand your interests based on, for example, pages visited and browsing patterns on Schwab's websites.

### Opting Out of Online Behavioral Advertising

You may opt-out of receiving online behavioral advertisements from third-party advertising companies that Schwab uses to serve these interest-based ads. Because Schwab participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory program, we have adopted the use of the DAA's Advertising Options Icon (AdChoices) on these ads for the purpose of allowing users the ability to opt-out of this form of tracking. You may click on the AdChoices icon to opt out of receiving behaviorally-targeted ads that are served to you based on your browsing behavior on Schwab websites. Please note that opting out through the AdChoices icon will only affect ads served to you based on your behavior on Schwab websites, and does not prevent you from receiving other Schwab advertising. You may also opt out of receiving behaviorally-targeted ads directly at our website using this link: [![](https://cdn.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png)AdChoices](http://info.evidon.com/pub_info/8193?v=1). Opting out through findyourindependentadvisor.com, as opposed to using the AdChoices icon, means the data about your behaviors on findyourindependentadvisor.com will not be used by third party advertising companies to serve you interest-based ads.

The methods of both collecting data for the purpose of serving behaviorally-targeted ads and recording your opt-out are done at the individual computer browser level and are based on browser cookies. If you clear your cookies or use a different browser or computer, you will need to re-submit your preference to the specified third-party advertising companies.
