Privacy Policy
==============

We, at ReadTheory LP (“**ReadTheory**“, “**we**” or “**us**“) regard your privacy with the seriousness it deserves. This Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we may collect about you and your children. It also explains how we store, use and disclose such information, including any personally identifiable information (“**Personal Information**” or “**PII**“), in connection with your or your children’s use of our web-based application  (“**Website**”).

 Note: ReadTheory has relationships and agreements with schools, districts state Departments of Education and other organizations (**“Entity or Entities”)** for classroom and group use of this Website. When we have a relationship with these Entities there are separate written agreements that also govern your use of this Website and the use of your Personal Information. If you belong to one of these Entities or your use of this Website falls under the category of classroom or group use, please check with your relevant Entity to review the terms and conditions that may also govern your use of this Website.

To review [our policies on children’s](#COPPA) [data.](#COPPA)

**PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OR SOME OF THE TERMS HEREOF, WE KINDLY REQUEST THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE WEBSITE.**

**Consent**

By using the Website you expressly consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the [**Terms of Use**](https://readtheory.org/terms-and-conditions/) (of which this Privacy Policy is an integral part and which is binding on all users of our Website), and to the collection, use and disclosure of your information, including Personal Information, as may be applicable to you or your children, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in our Terms of Use. Certain services featured on our Website may require submission of your Personal Information. Any such Personal Information will be collected solely with your prior consent. Where a ‘Student Account’ is created on behalf of a student who is under the age of 13 (“**Child**” or “**Children**”, respectively), the Child’s parent or legal guardian will be required to consent to the collection of the Child’s Personal Information in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). You are encouraged to maintain a record of the Child’s username and password; supervise and keep track of the Child’s activity in the account; and contact any teacher linked to your Child’s account with any specific questions regarding the Child’s progress and the use of the information by such teacher.

If you, as a parent or legal guardian, become aware that a Child under your care or supervision has provided us information without your consent, or provided us with information that you would like to have removed or updated, please contact us at [**support@readtheory.org**](mailto:support@readtheory.org).

If your use of the Website is under the umbrella of a relationship and agreement we have with your school or district, please note that the ownership of your personal information vests with the school or district. ReadTheory will handle your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you retain various rights over your personal information, such as the right to delete it.

**Information We Collect**

In order to enjoy the benefits of our Website, you will be required to open a user account (either a ‘Student Account’, ‘Parent Account’ or ‘Teacher Account’), and provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, a user name and password and an optional e-mail address. A Student Account can be created by the student, the student’s parent or legal guardian or the student’s teacher.

When creating a username for your account, please do not use personally identifiable information such as the user’s name, phone number, date of birth or email address, but rather use pseudonyms or other combinations of letters and numbers that do not identify you.

When associating a Student Account with a Teacher Account, we will collect the user’s first and last name to help teachers identify their students. The collection of the student’s e-mail address is optional. When a Student Account is for a Child and associated with a Teacher Account, we will not collect the full first name of the Child but only the first initial of the first name and the last name and an optional field of the parent’s e-mail address.

If you contact us for customer support or submit other types of queries through our Website by clicking on an email link, we may ask for or collect additional information from you in order to respond to you or address your concerns.

The Website allows the collection of such information such as quiz results, comparative analyses of students’ performance, and other statistical data concerning students, which may provide teachers with insight and a better understanding of their students’ performance trends and results, such data and progress reports are accessible only by the teacher whose registered Teacher Account is directly linked to that particular ‘Student Account’, and are not shared by us with any third party for commercial purposes.

We may also collect certain information that does not by itself identify a specific individual (“**non-Personal Information**”). Such information may tell us about the type of browser you use, identify your Internet Service Provider (ISP), tell us about your browsing actions, demographic information, network status and other types of user activity (clicks on links or advertisements, downloads, etc.).

We use analytics and similar services (e.g., Google Analytics) to help us deliver a better and more personalized service to you by enabling us to gauge usage patterns, customize our services according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.

**COPPA Compliance**

Our Website and the collection of Children’s Personal Information are operated in compliance with COPPA. You will see numerous references throughout this Privacy Policy concerning parental consent and supervision of Children’s Student Accounts, ensuring that targeted advertising is not served to Children, et cetera. If you become aware that a Child under your care or supervision has provided us with Personal Information without your consent or provided us with information that you would like to have removed or updated, please contact us at support@readtheory.org.

**FERPA Compliance**

In certain circumstances, we may contract with an Entity that may disclose FERPA-protected data and Personal Information to us. Under these contractual agreements, and to the extent applicable, we collect and use the data in compliance with FERPA.  

**GDPR Compliance**

ReadTheory’s privacy practices are compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and this Privacy Policy has been drafted taking into consideration the provisions of the regulation. By using this Website, any information provided to us is collected for the purposes of providing our services to you. Any processing or transfer of your Personal Information will be done by ReadTheory as described in this Privacy Policy. You have a right to access and update your or your Child’s Personal Information at any time. You also have the right to request that your or your Child’s Personal Information and/or account be deleted. Please contact us at [**support@readtheory.org**](mailto:support@readtheory.org) to submit your request. Please be advised that if you request the deletion of your account, all Personal Information collected about/from you will be promptly deleted and you will no longer be able to use the services on our Website.

**Use of Cookies**

Our Website uses “cookies” and other similar technologies (such as web beacons, pixel tags, scripts, tags, etc.) in providing our services to you. Such technologies allow us to collect information about our users, their devices and their online behavior automatically, which we can then use to enhance your navigation on the Website, improve our services, personalize your user experience, and collect statistics about user preferences, behavior, etc. and administer a variety of other analytical tasks.

If your use of the Website is under the umbrella of a relationship and agreement we have with your school or district who pays for the use of the Website, we will only use the following cookies:

1. Our own cookies for operating the Website.
2. Third party cookies for the purposes of support, maintenance and ongoing administration of the Website.

If your use of the Website is not under the umbrella of a school or district who pays for the use of the Website, then in addition to the cookies explained above, we will also use third party cookies to display online targeted ads to you. We exclusively partner with reputable and thoroughly vetted third party ad networks. We also have a specialized team in place that proactively filters and restricts any inappropriate advertising categories and creatives. You cannot opt-out of our sharing data with advertisers. However, we will not use cookies for targeted advertising in each of these cases:

1. Students under the age of 13 years.
2. Upon specific requests from school districts, which have provided us with email suffixes associated with student and teacher accounts.

A “cookie” is a small piece of information that a website assigns to your computer or mobile device while you are viewing it. Cookies could be very helpful and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, enabling automatic activation of certain features, remembering your preferences and making the interaction between you and the services offered on our Website quicker and easier. Cookies are also used to help ensure that the advertisements you see, if any, are relevant to you and your interests.

You may remove our cookies by following the instructions of your device preferences; however, if you choose to disable cookies, some features of our Website and/or services we may offer may not operate properly and your online experience may be limited.

From time to time, our Website may include a link to a third-party site and if the link is clocked the third-party may place a cookie on your device. Such cookies may be used to serve you personalized advertisements, measure such advertisements’ effectiveness, or otherwise personalize the content provided to you through the Website. Although we do not have control over these third-party cookies, you are able to disable such cookies through your individual browser settings. Please note that the settings offered by a certain browser or device often only apply to that particular browser or device, so you may need to reset your settings if you access our Website on a different device. All of the above is, subject, however, to our policy of not serving personalized advertising to Children (as further described in the section titled ‘Interaction with Third Party Services and Third Party Advertising’ of this Privacy Policy).  

Importantly, we do not track student behavior (e.g. browsing habits, search inquiries, use of social media) outside of the Website.

**Storage and Transfer of Data**

We store your information on our servers located in the United States. If you are located within the European Union, please note that information collected by us may be transferred outside the European Union / European Economic Area and your consent to this Privacy Policy and continued use of our Website represents your agreement to such transfer. Note, however, that any such transfer will be made solely for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable laws.

**How We Protect Your Information**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry frameworks and standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect information submitted to us.

We encrypt your data when in transit and during storage. We segment and store sensitive data on separate networks. We enforce a Least Privilege Access Policy where data can only be viewed and accessed on a need to know basis. We conduct internal risk assessments and security assessments and undergo yearly security audits by a different independent third party.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we apply industry-standard security measures to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality.

We also have implemented a comprehensive breach response protocol that involves containment and isolation, followed by assessment and a timely, clear, and transparent notification to appropriate stakeholders, including internal teams, users, and regulatory authorities. Communication to users regarding such incidents would be conducted directly through in-application messages and email, ensuring clarity and timely dissemination of information.

If you have any specific questions or security concerns, please contact us at [**support@readtheory.org**](mailto:support@readtheory.org).

**Interaction with Third Party Services and Third Party Advertising**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own, control, or manage, including the third party that may advertise on our Website or provide links on our Website.  Although while using our Website you may be able to connect or interact with third-party sites, including those involving serving of advertisements, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content displayed on or by any Third-Party sites. Because such Third-Party sites may involve the collection of Personal Information from you, whether through cookies or otherwise, we encourage you to read the terms of use and privacy policy of each Third-Party service or site that you choose to use or interact with.

While our Website includes third-party advertising, ReadTheory ensures that any such third-party advertising only shows advertisements that are appropriate for children. Furthermore, targeted or interest-based advertising is displayed only for those users who have been expressly flagged as being over the age of 13.

Even if you do not request to opt-out, we automatically delete data of users that are inactive for more than two years.

**Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy**

In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign information, including Personal Information, in connection with the foregoing events. In such an event, our affiliated companies or acquiring company will assume the rights and obligations as described in this Privacy Policy.
