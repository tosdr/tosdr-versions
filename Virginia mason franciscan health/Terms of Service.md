**15\. Indemnity**

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our officers, members, directors, employees, contractors, and agents (“**Indemnified Party**” or collectively “**Indemnified Parties**”), from and against any and all claims, actions, losses or expenses, including attorneys’ fees and costs and expenses, arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of all or part of the Online Services; (b) any personal information you provide to the Online Services; (c) an alleged or actual breach by you of these Terms; (d) your infringement or misappropriation of our IP; or (e) any negligence or willful misconduct by you.

**16\. Choice of Law**

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, exclusive of its choice of law rules.

**17\. Dispute Resolution**

1.   Arbitration

You agree that any dispute, action, or claim relating in any manner to these Terms or the Online Services will be resolved, individually and not in a class action, by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including any claim that all or any part, of these Terms is void or voidable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco County, California as necessary to protect the party’s rights or property.

2. Class Action Waiver 

A class action, consolidated action, or representative action is a legal proceeding brought by a group of people, with an identical claim, who are represented together by a member of the group.

By agreeing to these Terms, you agree that any dispute, action, or claim will be resolved on an individual basis and not in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. If, for any reason, any dispute, action, or claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you agree to only bring your claim on an individual basis and not as part of a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. You agree to waive any rights that you may have to bring a claim in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.

**18\. Miscellaneous**

1.   Changes to these Terms

We may revise and update the Terms and will post the updated Terms to the Online Services. Unless otherwise stated in the amended version of the Terms, any changes to the Terms will apply immediately upon posting. If we make, in our sole discretion, material changes to the Terms we may provide you notice of the updated Terms. Your use of the Online Services will constitute your agreement to the updated Terms.

2\. Severability

If any portion of these Terms are held unenforceable, the unenforceable portion shall be construed to the greatest extent possible under applicable law. Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.

3\. No Waivers

Our failure to enforce or exercise our rights under or provision of the Terms, does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. 

4\. No Assignments and Transfers

You may not assign or transfer any rights provided to you under these Terms to a third party, without our prior written consent which we may withhold, in our sole discretion, for any reason.

5\. No Third-Party Beneficiaries

Nothing in these Terms will confer upon any third party, not a party to these Terms, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities whatsoever. 

6\. Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to your use of Online Services and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. The Terms may not be amended except as set forth in Section 19(A)(Changes to these Terms).  

 7. Notices 

You may send us any questions, concerns, or relevant notices to the contact information provided below in Section 17(H)(Contact Us). You agree to receive all communications from us by e-mail. You are responsible for providing us with up-to-date contact information, which you may do by updating Your Account or sending a message to us.
