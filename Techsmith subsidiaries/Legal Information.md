**TechSmith Corporation Privacy Notice**
========================================

**This Privacy Notice is effective as of June 13, 2024**

At TechSmith Corporation (“TechSmith”), we recognize the importance of protecting your personal information and are committed to processing it responsibly and in compliance with applicable data protection laws in all countries, states, or other jurisdictions in which we operate.

**SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY NOTICE:**
---------------------------------

In the normal course of its business activities, TechSmith collects, uses, and sometimes shares personal information of various individuals and organizations in order to run its day-to-day operations and provide products and services for your use. This Privacy Notice applies to all users of TechSmith products and services and to visitors to TechSmith websites and TechSmith operated social media sites (we refer to the TechSmith website, social media sites, and our products and services as “Sites and/or Services” in this Notice). This Notice describes TechSmith’s general privacy practices that apply to such personal information collection and use.  
  
This Notice does not apply to: (1) personal information relating to employees, applicants for employment, or contractors providing services to TechSmith, (2) user generated or created content that is uploaded to TechSmith products and services, (3) circumstances when TechSmith is acting as a processor of personal data on behalf of a data controller or (4) when TechSmith products or services utilize a component of your operating environment and that component collects personal information.

**1\. TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT**
------------------------------------------------

"Personal Information," as used in this Notice, is any information that identifies, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household. Examples of Personal Information include an individual’s name, username, email address, phone number, or other similar identifiers, information about products or services purchased or used, browsing and search history, and location data.

**2\. HOW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**
------------------------------------------------

We collect Personal Information in four ways:

1. We collect Personal Information you provide to us in optional, voluntary submissions such as registration forms, user profiles, promotional signups, sweepstakes/contest entries, requests for customer service, and software and mobile applications downloads
2. We may collect some Personal Information automatically to perform a contract with you, where we have legal obligations to do so, or where our legitimate interests permit such collection. This is described below in "[Passive Data Collection](#passive-data-collection)."
3. When you register to use a trial version of our products, we agree to provide you with guidance to assist you in using our products.  To fulfill this obligation, we collect information concerning your use of the product.  You have the ability to turn off this information collection.
4. We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third-party sources to perform a contract with you, where we have a legal obligation to do so, or where our legitimate interests permit such collection. If we directly combine information from third parties with Personal Information we have collected, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information and handle it in accordance with this Notice. In addition, please note we may solicit third parties to collect Personal Information on our behalf such as social media platform providers and, in such cases, we instruct those third parties to comply with this Notice and all applicable data protection laws.
5. On behalf of our customers where we act as a processor of Personal Information through our online services. In this situation, this Notice does not apply.

#### _Analytics Tools_

### **Cookies**

We may use a variety of methods, including "cookies" to collect information.

#### _What is a cookie?_

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. The contents of these cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device and save information between website pages or on-line sessions. You can find more information about cookies at:  [All About Cookies.Org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Cookies do lots of different jobs, such as letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. They can also help to ensure advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

 The cookies used on our Sites and/or Services by category are described below.

1. Optional Cookies
    1. _Targeting Cookies_  
          
        These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They do not directly store Personal Information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. 
    2. _Social Media Cookies_  
          
        These cookies are set by a range of social media services we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks.

### **Third-Party Advertising Technologies**

We may permit certain third-party companies to help us tailor advertising we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on our Sites and/or Services (e.g., to allow them to tailor ads on third party services). **We do not sell your information to third parties.** These companies may deliver ads that might place cookies and otherwise track user behavior. These companies may use information about user behavior in order to provide customized advertisements across various services and products.

Each of these companies uses this cookie information according to their own privacy and security policies. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out as indicated in this Notice. Please note this does not opt you out of being delivered advertising; you will continue to receive generic ads.

We do not knowingly seek or collect Personal Information from users under the age of 16 (a “Child” or “Children”), except to the extent that TechSmith may collect limited Personal Information from Children (but not their email addresses) where that Child's school or school district has contracted with TechSmith to collect the Personal Information from the Children for the educational context authorized by the school or school district.

If you believe your information has been collected and you are under the age of 16, please contact [privacy@techsmith.com](mailto:privacy@techsmith.com). If you are a user under the age of 16 and your parent or guardian signed up for an account for you with TechSmith using a password or access ID provided by your school, your parent or guardian may be able to view all information contained in your account.  This includes information such as messages between you and your teacher, and grades you received on your assignment.

**3\. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

### **Third-Party Advertising**

We use your information, including Personal Information, behavioral metrics, geo-location data, demographic data, and marketing preferences to personalize and display advertisements and other content for you. If you elect to opt-out, you may not be able to receive advertising content personalized for you, however you still receive non-personalized marketing content.

### **Sharing Features**

We use your information, including Personal Information, and any other information you submit directly or through passive means to provide you with various ways to connect and share content (e.g., web content, user generated videos, text, drawings, and screen and lecture captures, and quizzing features, media, tools, services and other products) with third parties. For example, we may provide you with the opportunity to email a link to certain content to another person. To use this feature, we may require you to provide certain Personal Information including your email address and the email address of each person to whom you send the link.

We also may allow you to share links to content with users of various third-party services (e.g., social networking, search and sharing services). By using any of these third-party services to share links to content, you permit us to access, use and disclose any information relating to your account on each such third-party service (such as your username and profile information) that we make available for your use.  We do not store your user credentials of these third-party services.

### **Protecting the Rights of TechSmith and others**

We use your information, including Personal Information, and any other information you submit directly or through passive means to protect misuse of our and our partners’ intellectual property. 

### **Artificial Intelligence**

Techsmith may utilize artificial intelligence provided by a vendor or other third party. Techsmith makes sure that information that is provided does not get added to or used for training additional AI based projects and is generally used in the context of Techsmith products.

**4\. REASONS WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**
--------------------------------------------------

We may share your Personal Information as necessary to maintain business operations, such as with vendors working on our behalf (for example, delivery of services and digital advertising); as required by law or to respond to legal process; to maintain the security of our products; to monitor and enforce our rights as a licensor; to respond to an inquiry from a licensee concerning information in connection with users registered under their corporate email domain, to protect TechSmith’s customers, employees, rights, or property; as part of a merger or acquisition; or with your expressed consent. If we share your Personal Information with a third party acting on our behalf, we remain liable for any harm that is caused by that third party if they have processed Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Notice or applicable law.

TechSmith does not “sell” personal information as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act.

**5\. WHERE WE STORE AND PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**
------------------------------------------------------------

Personal Information collected by TechSmith may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where TechSmith, its processors, or its sub-processors operate and/or have facilities. We may transfer Personal Information from the European Union or European Economic Area (“EU”), or the United Kingdom, to other countries.

* TechSmith commits to resolving complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with questions or concerns about the use of their Personal Information should contact us at  [How to Contact Us](https://www.techsmith.com/privacy-policy.html#contactus).                                                                                                                                                                                       
* If a Customer's question or concern cannot be satisfied through this process, TechSmith commits to engage with an independent dispute resolution mechanism operated by the European Union Data Protection Authorities (EU DPA) or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and to comply with the advice given by the EU DPA or FDPIC, as applicable.

If your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by TechSmith, EU individuals may bring a complaint before an [EU Data Protection Authority](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm) or Swiss individuals may bring a complaint before the [FDPIC](http://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/task.html).

**6\. HOW WE SECURE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**
-----------------------------------------------

TechSmith uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information, no security system is impenetrable and, due to the inherent nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. You should take steps to protect the security of your user account information, login, and password.

**7\. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**
----------------------------------------------------

We retain Personal Information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements, and improving our products.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize the Personal Information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), we then securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

When we collect Personal Information as a processor on behalf of the controller, the controller is the party who provides instructions on deleting or anonymizing the Personal Information.

**8\. HOW TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**
-----------------------------------------------------------

You may access and review the Personal Information TechSmith stores about you and correct any factual errors. Most of your Personal Information may be accessed and corrected by simply logging into your account and accessing your profile. For any other changes, please contact [TechSmith Customer Service](https://support.techsmith.com/hc/en-us).

### **1     Rights of Data Subjects**

The legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above depends on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. 

However, we normally collect Personal Information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms as described in Section 3.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “[How to contact us](https://www.techsmith.com/privacy-policy.html#contactus)” heading below.

You may have the following rights dependent upon the jurisdiction you reside in:

* You may request access to your information, confirming TechSmith’s possession of your information or request a copy of it.
* You may request TechSmith to correct information related to you. Where a correction is subjective in nature, TechSmith may reject the request, but will note the correction was made and the nature of the request.
* You may request the erasure of your information.
* You may object to processing of your Personal Information or ask us to restrict processing of your Personal Information.
* You may request that TechSmith transfer a copy of your information to another controller (portability).
* You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you. 
* Similarly, if we have collected and processed your Personal Information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
* You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Information.  EU individuals may bring a complaint before an [EU Data Protection Authority](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm) or Swiss individuals may bring a complaint before the [FDPIC](http://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/task.html).

When TechSmith is the controller of your Personal Information, you can exercise your rights by contacting us using the information provided in the [“How to contact us”](https://www.techsmith.com/privacy-policy.html#contactus) section heading below.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with the requirements of applicable data protection laws.

**9\. NOTICE REGARDING AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING AND PROFILING**
----------------------------------------------------------------

In some instances, our use of your Personal Information may result in automated decisions being taken (including profiling).

Automated decisions mean a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without our human review. For example, we use automated decisions to provide targeted advertising on our Services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of targeted advertising by contacting us using the information provided in the  [“How to contact us”](#contactus) section heading below.
