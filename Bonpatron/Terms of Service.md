### Terms & Conditions of Usage

This is a pedagogically inspired site that is designed to help users identify common spelling and grammar mistakes. Please keep in mind the following:

* no linguistic tool is perfect and the onus is on the user to recognize the limitations of this tool; in particular:
    * no guarantees are made that this site will find any or all spelling and grammar errors in a text
    * in some cases the site may falsely identify errors that are in fact not errors
* in no event shall anyone associated with this site (creators, developers, administrators, etc.) be liable for any problems that arise due to the use of the site

For the benefit of all users, certain restrictions are placed on the usage of this site. Violations of any of the restrictions below may result in a warning by email and temporary suspension of the account. In more severe cases, at the discretion of the site's administrators, an account may be cancelled (without subscription refund).

* there are more than 50 requests in one day from an account
* excessively large texts are submitted (this tool is designed for shorter texts of fewer than 1000 words)
* requests originate from more than 3 locations in one day from one account
* there is any unauthorized or suspicious usage of the site

This site has been produced by two individuals who enjoy working on linguistic tools and who want to provide a service to the greater community – please be mindful of other users by using the tool as intended.

 I have read the terms and conditions and I accept them.
