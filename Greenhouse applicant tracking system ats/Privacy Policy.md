Legal – Data processing addendum
================================

Data processing addendum
------------------------

[**Access and sign the Data processing addendum**](https://powerforms.docusign.net/4a280f08-f0de-423e-9594-4e4c79486a3d?env=na3&acct=184bca35-b23e-45a0-8034-1dbbe4d114b1&accountId=184bca35-b23e-45a0-8034-1dbbe4d114b1)

**THIS DATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM (**“**DPA**”**)** is incorporated into, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the Master Subscription Agreement or other written or electronic agreement (“**Agreement**”) between **Greenhouse Software, Inc.**, a company whose registered office is at 228 Park Avenue S, PMB 14744, New York, NY 10003-1502 USA (“**Greenhouse**”); and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, whose registered office is at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (“**Controller**”), governing Controller’s use of the Greenhouse software and services (the “**Services**”). All capitalised terms not defined in this DPA shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.

In the course of providing the Services to Controller, Greenhouse may process Personal Data (defined below) and the parties agree to comply with the following provisions with respect to any processing of Personal Data by Greenhouse as a processor to Controller.

NOW IT IS AGREED as follows:  

**1\. Data Protection**

1.1. _Definitions:_ In this DPA, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

(a) “**controller**”, “**processor**”, “**data subject**”, “**personal** **data**”, “**process**”, and “**processing**” shall have the meanings given in European Data Protection Law;  
  
(b) “**Applicable Data Protection Law**” means all worldwide data protection and privacy laws and regulations, to the extent applicable to the parties and the nature of the personal data processed under the Agreement, including, where applicable, (i) European Data Protection Law; and (ii) the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “**CCPA**”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020;  
  
(c) “**Data Privacy Framework**” means (as applicable) the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework self-certification programs operated by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and their respective successors.  
  
(d) “**Data Privacy Framework Principles**” means the Principles and Supplemental Principles contained in the relevant Data Privacy Framework, as amended, superseded or replaced.  
  
(e) “**European Data Protection Law**” means: (i) Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) (the “**EU GDPR**”); (ii) the EU GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of section 3 of the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “**UK GDPR**”); (iii) the EU e-Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC); (iv) any and all applicable national data protection laws made under, pursuant to or that apply in conjunction with any of (i), (ii) or (iii); and (v) the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (the “**Swiss DPA**”); in each case as may be amended or superseded from time to time;  
  
(f) “**Personal Data**” means information that identifies a person, such as a name or online identifier, that is uploaded into the Services by Controller or by third parties acting on Controller’s behalf, including job applicants. To the extent the CCPA applies to this DPA, Personal Data means “Personal Information,” as such term is defined in the CCPA, that is uploaded into the Services by Controller or by third parties acting on Controller’s behalf, including job applicants;  
  
(g) “**Restricted Transfer**” means: (i) where the EU GDPR applies, a transfer of Personal Data from the European Economic Area to a country outside of the European Economic Area which is not subject to an adequacy determination by the European Commission; (ii) where the UK GDPR applies, a transfer of Personal Data from the United Kingdom to any other country which is not based on adequacy regulations pursuant to Section 17A of the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018; and (iii) where the Swiss DPA applies, a transfer of Personal Data to a country outside of Switzerland which is not included on the list of adequate jurisdictions published by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner;  
  
(h) “**Security Incident**” means any breach of security that leads to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of or access to Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed by Greenhouse under this DPA.  
  
(i) “**Standard Contractual Clauses**” or “**EU SCCs**” means the contractual clauses annexed to the European Commission’s Implementing Decision 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council;  
  
(j) **“Subprocessor”** means any third-party processor engaged by Greenhouse to process any Personal Data in connection with the Services provided to Controller (but shall not include Greenhouse employees, contractors or consultants);  
  
(k) “**UK Addendum**” means the “International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses” issued by the UK Information Commissioner under S119A(1) Data Protection Act 2018, as amended or updated from time to time.

1.2. _Relationship of the parties_: Greenhouse will process Personal Data on behalf of Controller, as further described in Annex I of this DPA. Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Data Protection Law. To the extent Greenhouse will process Personal Data that is subject to the CCPA, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Greenhouse will act as a “Service Provider,” as such term is defined in the CCPA, in its performance of its obligations pursuant to this DPA or the Agreement, and Greenhouse certifies that it understands and will comply with its processing obligations. Similarly, to the extent Controller directs Greenhouse to process Personal Data that is subject to the CCPA, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Controller will act as a “Business,” as such term is defined in the CCPA, in its performance of its obligations pursuant to this DPA or the Agreement.

1.3. _Prohibited data_: Controller shall not disclose (and shall not request any data subject to disclose) any special categories of Personal Data to Greenhouse for processing except where and to the extent expressly disclosed in Annex I.

1.4. _Purpose limitation:_ Greenhouse shall process the Personal Data in accordance with Controller’s documented instructions and, for these purposes, Controller instructs Greenhouse to process Personal Data for the purposes described in Annex I (the “**Permitted Purpose**”), except where otherwise required by law(s) that are not incompatible with Applicable Data Protection Law. To the extent Greenhouse will process Personal Data that is subject to the CCPA, the Permitted Purpose is the “Business Purpose,” as such term is defined in the CCPA, and Greenhouse will retain, use or disclose the Personal Data only for such Business Purpose. In no event shall Greenhouse process the Personal Data for its own purposes or those of any third party. Greenhouse shall not “sell” or “share” the Personal Data, as such terms are defined by Applicable Data Protection Law, nor shall Greenhouse combine the Personal Data with personal data that Greenhouse receives from other sources, except as permitted by the Permitted Purpose or required by law(s) that are not incompatible with Applicable Data Protection Law. Greenhouse shall immediately inform Controller if it becomes aware that Controller’s processing instructions infringe Applicable Data Protection Law (but without obligation to actively monitor Controller’s compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law).

1.5. _Data Privacy Framework_:

(a) Greenhouse is self-certified under the Data Privacy Framework, as administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in order to implement appropriate safeguards for transfers of Personal Data to the United States pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR. To the extent the Data Privacy Framework can be used to lawfully transfer Personal Data to the United States, and for as long Greenhouse is self-certified to the Data Privacy Framework, Greenhouse will: (a) process such Personal Data only for the limited and specified purposes set out in the Agreement, including this DPA; (b) provide at least the same level of privacy protection to the Personal Data as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles; (c) promptly notify Controller if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation under (b) above, and in such event, to promptly take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate any processing until such time as the processing meets the level of protection as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles; and (d) at Controller’s sole election, to cease processing the Personal Data if, in Controller’s reasonable discretion, Greenhouse is not providing the same level of protection to the Personal Data as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles. Greenhouse intends to remain self-certified under the Data Privacy Framework as long as the Data Privacy Framework is recognized as a valid transfer mechanism under Applicable Data Protection Law. Details about Greenhouse’s self-certification to the Data Privacy Framework is available at: [https://www.dataprivacyframewo...](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt00000004U1KAAU&status=Active).

(b) Controller acknowledges that Greenhouse may disclose this DPA and any relevant privacy provisions in the Agreement to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Federal Trade Commission, a relevant European supervisory authority or other public or regulatory authority, court or tribunal, upon their request.

(c) If Greenhouse is unable to comply with this Section 1.5, Section 1.6 shall apply.  
  
(d) To the extent that the Data Privacy Framework is subsequently revoked, or held in a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to pursue a suitable alternate mechanism that can lawfully support the transfer of Personal Data, such as relying on the mechanism as described in Section 1.6.

1.6. _Restricted transfers_: The parties agree that to the extent the transfer of Personal Data from Controller to Greenhouse is a Restricted Transfer and European Data Protection Law requires that appropriate safeguards are put in place, such transfer shall be subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses, which shall be deemed incorporated by reference and form an integral part of this DPA as follows:

(a) in relation to Personal Data that is protected by the EU GDPR, the EU SCCs will apply completed as follows:

(i) Module Two (controller to processor) will apply;

(ii) in Clause 7, the optional docking clause will apply;  
  
(iii) in Clause 9, Option 2 will apply, and the time period for prior notice of Subprocessor changes shall be as set out in Clause 1.9 of this DPA;

(iv) in Clause 11, the optional language will not apply;

(v) in Clause 17, Option 1 will apply, and the EU SCCs will be governed by Irish law;  
  
(vi) in Clause 18(b), disputes shall be resolved before the courts of Ireland;

(vii) Annex I of the EU SCCs shall be deemed completed with the information set out in Annex I to this DPA; and

(viii) Annex II of the EU SCCs shall be deemed completed with the information set out in Annex II to this DPA.  

(b) in relation to Personal Data that is protected by the UK GDPR, the Standard Contractual Clauses: (i) shall apply as completed in accordance with paragraph (a) above; and (ii) shall be deemed amended as specified by the UK Addendum, which shall be deemed executed by the parties and incorporated into and form an integral part of this DPA. In addition, Tables 1 to 3 in Part 1 of the UK Addendum shall be completed respectively with the information set out in Annexes I and II of this DPA, and Table 4 in Part 1 shall be deemed completed by selecting “neither party”.  

(c) in relation to transfers of Personal Data protected by the Swiss DPA, the Standard Contractual Clauses will also apply in accordance with paragraph (a) above, with the following modifications:

(i) references to “Regulation (EU) 2016/679” shall be interpreted as references to the Swiss DPA;

(ii) references to specific Articles of “Regulation (EU) 2016/679” shall be replaced with the equivalent article or section of the Swiss DPA;  
  
(iii) references to “EU”, “Union”, “Member State” and “Member State law” shall be replaced with references to “Switzerland”, or “Swiss law”;

(iv) the term “member state” shall not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude data subjects in Switzerland from the possibility of suing for their rights in their place of habitual residence (i.e., Switzerland);

(v) Clause 13(a) and Part C of Annex I are not used and the “competent supervisory authority” is the Swiss Federal Data Protection Information Commissioner;  
  
(vi) references to the “competent supervisory authority” and “competent courts” shall be replaced with references to the “Swiss Federal Data Protection Information Commissioner” and “applicable courts of Switzerland”;

(vii) in Clause 17, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland; and

(viii) with respect to transfers to which the Swiss DPA applies, Clause 18(b) shall state that disputes shall be resolved before the applicable courts of Switzerland.

(d) in the event that any provision of this DPA contradicts, directly or indirectly, the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.

1.7. _Onward transfers:_ Greenhouse shall not participate in (nor permit any Subprocessor to participate in) any other Restricted Transfers of Personal Data (whether as an exporter or an importer of the Personal Data) unless the Restricted Transfer is made in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law and this DPA. Such measures may include (without limitation) transferring the Personal Data to a recipient in a country that the European Commission has decided provides adequate protection for personal data, to a recipient that has achieved binding corporate rules authorisation in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law, or pursuant to Standard Contractual Clauses implemented between the relevant exporter and importer of the Personal Data.

1.8. _Confidentiality of processing:_ Greenhouse shall ensure that any person that it authorises to process the Personal Data (including Greenhouse’s staff, agents and Subprocessors) (an “**Authorised Person**”) shall be subject to a strict duty of confidentiality (whether a contractual duty or a statutory duty), and shall not permit any person to process the Personal Data who is not under such a duty of confidentiality. Greenhouse shall ensure that all Authorised Persons process the Personal Data only as necessary for the Permitted Purpose.

1.9. _Security:_ Greenhouse shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to protect the Personal Data from Security Incidents and to preserve the confidentiality of Personal Data in accordance with Annex II to this DPA (“**Security Measures**”). Such measures shall have regard to the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons and include as appropriate:  

(a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;

(b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;

(c) the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;  
  
(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

Controller acknowledges that the Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and that Greenhouse may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not degrade or diminish overall security of the Services.

1.10. _Subprocessing:_ Subject to Greenhouse complying with this Section 1.10, Controller agrees that Greenhouse may engage Subprocessors to process Personal Data on Controller’s behalf, including the Subprocessors listed in Annex III to this DPA. Greenhouse shall: (i) provide at least 30 days’ prior notice of the addition of any Subprocessor (including details of the processing it performs or will perform); (ii) impose data protection terms on any Subprocessor it appoints that protect the Personal Data, in substance, to the same standard provided for by this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by such Subprocessor; and (iii) remain fully liable for any breach of this DPA that is caused by an act, error or omission of its Subprocessor. Controller may object in writing to Greenhouse’s appointment of a new Subprocessor on reasonable grounds relating to data protection by notifying Greenhouse promptly in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the above notice from Greenhouse. In such case, the parties shall discuss Controller’s concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If the parties cannot reach such resolution, Greenhouse will not appoint the Subprocessor or Controller may elect to suspend or terminate the Agreement without penalty.

1.11. _Cooperation and data subjects’ rights:_ Greenhouse shall provide all reasonable and timely assistance (including by appropriate technical and organisational measures) to Controller to enable Controller to respond to: (i) any request from a data subject to exercise any of its rights under Applicable Data Protection Law (including its rights of access, correction, objection, erasure and data portability, as applicable); and (ii) any other correspondence, enquiry or complaint received from a data subject, regulator or other third party in connection with the processing of the Personal Data. In the event that any such request, correspondence, enquiry or complaint is made directly to Greenhouse, Greenhouse shall promptly act to ensure that the same is provided to Controller.

1.12. _Data protection impact assessment:_ To the extent required under Applicable Data Protection Law, Greenhouse shall (considering the nature of the processing and the information available to Greenhouse) provide Controller with all such reasonably requested information regarding the Services to enable Controller to conduct a data protection impact assessment or prior consultations with data protection authorities in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law. Greenhouse shall comply with the foregoing by: (i) complying with Section 1.16 (“Security reports and due diligence”); (ii) providing the information contained in the Agreement, including this DPA; and (iii) if the foregoing sub-sections (i) and (ii) are insufficient for Controller to comply with such obligations, upon request, providing additional reasonable assistance (at Controller’s expense).

1.13. _Security Incidents:_ Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Greenhouse shall inform Controller without undue delay and shall provide all such timely information and cooperation as Controller may reasonably require in order for Controller to fulfil its data breach reporting obligations under (and in accordance with the timescales required by) Applicable Data Protection Law. Greenhouse shall further take all such measures and actions as are reasonably necessary to remedy or mitigate the effects of the Security Incident and shall keep Controller informed of all developments in connection with the Security Incident.

1.14. _Deletion or return of Personal Data:_ Upon termination or expiry of the Agreement, Greenhouse shall (at Controller’s election) destroy or return to Controller all Personal Data (including all copies of the Personal Data) in its possession or control (including any Personal Data subcontracted to a third party for processing). This requirement shall not apply to the extent that Greenhouse is required by any applicable law to retain some or all of the Personal Data, in which event Greenhouse shall isolate and protect the Personal Data from any further processing except to the extent required by such law until deletion is possible.

1.15. _Audit rights:_ Greenhouse shall make available to Controller all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this DPA and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections by Controller in order to assess compliance with this DPA. Controller acknowledges and agrees that it shall exercise its audit rights under this DPA, and any other audit rights granted by Applicable Data Protection Law, by instructing Greenhouse to comply with the audit measures described in Section 1.16 below.

_1.16. _Security reports and due diligence_:_

(a) Controller acknowledges that Greenhouse is regularly audited against ISO 27001, ISO 27701 and SSAE 18 SOC 2 standards by independent third-party auditors. Upon written request, Greenhouse shall supply to Controller a summary copy of its audit report(s), which reports shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Agreement, so that Controller can verify Greenhouse’s compliance with audit standards against which it has been assessed and this DPA.

(b) In addition and upon Controller’s written request, Greenhouse shall respond to any reasonable requests for information made by Controller to confirm Greenhouse’s compliance with this DPA, including responses to information security, due diligence and audit questionnaires, by making additional information available regarding its information security program which Greenhouse generally makes available to its customers, provided that Controller shall not exercise this right more than once per year.
