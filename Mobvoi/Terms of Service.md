You will not remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices from material found on the App.

**3\. Trademarks/No Endorsement**. All trademarks, service marks and trade names of Mobvoi used herein (including but not limited to: Mobvoi name, Mobvoi corporate logo, the App name, the App design, and any logos) (collectively "Marks") are trademarks or registered trademarks of Mobvoi or its affiliates, partners, vendors or licensors.

**4\. Account Registration and Security**. You understand that you may need to create an account to have access to all of the parts of the App. In order to use those restricted portions of the App, you will: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your business as prompted by the App's registration or subscription page (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Mobvoi has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Mobvoi has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the App (or any portion thereof). You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You will not share your account information or your user name and password with any third party or permit any third party to logon to the App using your account information. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security of which you become aware. You are responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the App. We have the right to provide user billing, account, Content or use records, and related information under certain circumstances (such as in response to legal responsibility, lawful process, orders, subpoenas, or warrants, or to protect our rights, customers or business). Please note that anyone able to provide your personally identifiable information will be able to access your account so you should take reasonable steps to protect this information.

**5\. Solicited Submission Policy**. Where Mobvoi has specifically invited or requested submissions or comments, Mobvoi encourages users to submit content (e.g. comments to blog posts, participation in communities, tips, etc.) to Mobvoi that they have created for consideration in connection with the App ("**User Submissions**"). User Submissions remains the intellectual property of the individual user. By posting content on the App, you expressly grant Mobvoi a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up worldwide, fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform and display such content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Submission, in whole or in part, and in any form throughout the world in any media or technology, whether now known or hereafter discovered, including all promotion, advertising, marketing, merchandising, publicity and any other ancillary uses thereof, and including the unfettered right to sublicense such rights, in perpetuity throughout the universe. Any such User Submissions are deemed non-confidential and Mobvoi shall be under no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any information, in whatever form, contained in any User Submission.

**6\. Inappropriate User Submissions**. Mobvoi does not encourage, and does not seek User Submissions that result from any activity that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; or (iii) may constitute a crime or tort. You agree that you have not and will not engage in any of the foregoing activities in connection with producing your submission. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that in conjunction with your submission, you will not inflict emotional distress on other people, will not humiliate other people (publicly or otherwise), will not assault or threaten other people, will not enter onto private property without permission, will not impersonate any other person or misrepresent your affiliation, title, or authority, and will not otherwise engage in any activity that may result in injury, death, property damage, and/or liability of any kind. Mobvoi will reject any submissions in which Mobvoi believes, in its sole discretion, that any such activities have occurred. If notified by a user of a submission that allegedly violates any provision of these Terms of Use, Mobvoi reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, if such a violation has occurred, and to remove any such submission from the App at any time and without notice.

**7\. Inappropriate Material**. You are prohibited from using the App or the Services to post or send any unlawful, infringing, threatening, defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic or profane material or any material that infringes or misappropriates third party intellectual property or could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. You further understand and agree that sending unsolicited advertisements or "spam" to any user of the Services is expressly prohibited by this Agreement. In addition to any remedies that we may have at law or in equity, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated or are likely to violate the foregoing prohibitions or any applicable rules or policies linked to in this Agreement, we may take any action we deem necessary to cure or prevent the violation, including without limitation, banning you from participating in our Services and/or the immediate removal of the related materials from the Services at any time without notice. We will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order or subpoena requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting such materials.

**8\. User Published Content**. User published Content and User Submissions do not represent the views of Mobvoi or any individual associated with Mobvoi, and we do not control this Content. In no event shall you represent or suggest, directly or indirectly, Mobvoi’s endorsement of user published Content. Mobvoi does not vouch for the accuracy or credibility of any user published Content on our App or User Submissions published through our Services, and do not take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of reviewing any such user published Content or User Submission. Through your use of the App and Services, you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, objectionable, harmful, inaccurate or deceptive. There may also be risks of dealing with underage persons, people acting under false pretense, international trade issues and foreign nationals. By using our App and Services, you assume all associated risks.

**9\. Contests, Sweepstakes and Games**. From time to time Mobvoi may offer contests, sweepstakes and games. Additional terms and conditions will apply to your participation in each contest, sweepstakes or game.

**10\. Advertising Rights**. Mobvoi reserves the right to sell, license and/or display any advertising, attribution, links, promotional and/or distribution rights in connection with your creative submission, and Mobvoi and its licensors or affiliates will be entitled to retain any and all revenue generated from any sales or licenses of such advertising, attribution, links, or promotional or distribution rights. Nothing in these additional terms obligates or may be deemed to obligate Mobvoi to sell, license or offer to sell or license any advertising, promotion or distribution rights.

**11\. Third Party Links**. From time to time, the App may contain links to web sites that are not owned, operated or controlled by Mobvoi or its affiliates. All such links are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the App. Neither we nor any of our respective affiliates are responsible for any content, materials or other information located on or accessible from any other web site. Neither we nor any of our respective affiliates endorse, guarantee, or make any representations or warranties regarding any other web sites, or any content, materials or other information located or accessible from any other web sites, or the results that you may obtain from using any other web sites. If you decide to access any other web sites linked to or from the App, you do so entirely at your own risk.

**12\. Transactional Partners**. In some cases we partner with another company to co-promote their services within our App. In these cases, you are transacting directly with the other party. On those pages, the transactional partners’ brand is clearly visible. When using these partner’s services, you are bound by such partner’s terms of service. We recommend you read their terms of service carefully.

**13\. Order Eligibility.** You may only purchase products which appear on the App and are delivered to an address within the relevant territory designated by Mobvoi (including Hong Kong). You may only purchase products for personal use by either yourself or your intended recipient of the products. Mobvoi may refuse any order that it has reasonable cause to believe is for onward sale other than through distribution channels approved by Mobvoi. Mobvoi makes no promise that products and services available on the App are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the designated territory, and accessing the App from territories where its contents are illegal or unlawful is prohibited. If you choose to access the App from locations outside the designated territory, you do so at your own risk. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased from the App.

**14\. Products, Content and Specifications.** Details of the products and services available for purchase are set out on the App. All features, content, specifications, products and prices of products and services described or depicted on the App are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. Packaging may vary from that shown. We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on the App at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. Occasionally, the manufacture or distribution of a certain product or service may be delayed for a number of reasons. In such event, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the delay and keep you informed of the revised delivery schedule. By placing an order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.

**15\. Shipping Limitations.** When an order is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the App. All purchases from the App are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from the App pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.

**16\. Accuracy of Information.** We attempt to ensure that information on the App is complete, accurate and current. Despite our efforts, the information on the App may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currency of any information on the App. For example, products included on the App may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may actually carry a different price than that stated on the App. In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice. While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.

**17\. Fees**. For all charges or deposits for any events, products and services sold on or through the App, Mobvoi or its vendors or agents will bill your bank card or alternative payment method offered by Mobvoi. When you provide bank card information, account numbers or other information necessary to facilitate payment to us or our vendors, you represent to us that you are the authorized user of the bank card or account of alternative payment method that is used to pay for the products and services. In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, you agree to reimburse Mobvoi and its vendors or agents for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorneys' fees and other legal expenses. You are responsible for purchase of, and payment of charges for, all Internet access services and telecommunications services needed for use of the App. You understand that we will hold and store such bank card or payment information to facilitate payment and deposit, damage reimbursement, and other liability purposes.

**18\. Eligibility to Subscribe to Services**. You may subscribe to the Services offered on the App in any location worldwide. Mobvoi makes no promise, however, that the Services available on the App are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the territory designated by Mobvoi for the App, and accessing the App from territories where its contents are illegal or unlawful is prohibited.

**19\. Right to Takedown Content.** Except as disclosed in our Privacy Policy, we will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a user's e-mail unless required in the course of normal maintenance of the App and its systems or unless required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Mobvoi or the App; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Mobvoi, the App, or the users of the App; or (3) act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our guests, the App, or the public. Users shall remain solely responsible for the content of their messages and Mobvoi shall have no obligation to prescreen any such content. However, we shall have the right in our sole discretion to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to or posted on the App at any time without notice. Without limiting the foregoing, we shall have the right to remove any material that we find to be in violation of the provisions hereof or otherwise objectionable, and the additional right to deny any user who fails to conform to any provision of these Terms of Service access to the App.

**20\. Termination**. You or we may suspend or terminate your account or your use of the App at any time, for any reason or for no reason. You are personally liable for any orders placed or charges incurred through your account prior to termination.
