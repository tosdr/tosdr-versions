For more information on our use of cookies, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://policies.wattpad.com/cookie-policy).

Aside from your username, which is required to set up your account and can be fictitious, we won’t display your Personal Information on the Site or reveal it to other Wattpad users (unless you choose to publicly display applicable information via your account settings) or rent or sell it to anyone unless the data has been anonymized.

Why do you ask for my date of birth?
------------------------------------

Children under 13 are not permitted to use Wattpad (under 14 if they are residents of Quebec), and so this Privacy Policy makes no provision for their use of Wattpad Services. We collect date of birth to determine eligibility to use Wattpad.

If you are a parent or guardian and learn that your minor child has provided us with Personal Information without your knowledge or agreement, please contact us using the details below.

Why do we collect and use your email?
-------------------------------------

We use email as an important way to communicate with you. You can manage your email notification preferences, such as messages and follower alerts, by adjusting your preferences in the Notifications section of your account Settings. You may also opt out or unsubscribe from any future email communications from within a link provided in each email we send you. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g., those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices from us.

What can other Wattpad users see?
---------------------------------

Our Services are designed to help you share information with the Wattpad community. Any Personal Information that you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area of the Service will be available to anyone who has access to that content (including other Wattpad users), such as your username, name, the profile description you create, and your location, as well as the messages you post, whether on your profile or to other users, and the lists you create, people you follow, stories you write, links to your Facebook profile or other personal website and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services.

We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, to develop new products and services for the Wattpad community, and to customize the content we show you, including ads.

Where do we store your Personal Information?
--------------------------------------------

Our Services are mainly provided from our offices in Canada. However, Personal Information that you submit through the Services may be transferred to countries other than where you reside (for example, to our servers in the United States) for processing and storage. In addition, our third-party service providers also may process or store your Personal Information on servers outside your country, including in Canada or the US.

We comply with applicable legal requirements when transferring Personal Information to countries other than the country where you are located. If you are in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the UK, we rely on the following mechanisms to transfer your Personal Information internationally: (i) an EU Commission adequacy decision, Swiss government adequacy decision or UK adequacy regulation (as appropriate), (ii) contractual protections for the transfer of your Personal Information, (iii) another valid data transfer mechanism.

How long does Wattpad keep my Personal Information?
---------------------------------------------------

We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.

If you create an account with Wattpad, we will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account remains active. If you close your account, it will first be deactivated for a period of six months. When your account is deactivated, while it is not viewable on Wattpad, all of your public contributions and comments to the Wattpad community will remain (except that they will be anonymized).

For six months after deactivation, it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated, including re-associating your comments and contributions to your profile. After six months, we permanently delete your Personal Information from our systems, except that your anonymized comments and contributions will remain on the Service.
