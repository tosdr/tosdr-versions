you with the services or products that you request, including access to location-based information,

and (2) monitor for fraud or other suspicious activity. The ways in which we collect location

advertisements tailored to your interests, which may include advertisements about our products

or services.

• CCPA Rights and Requests



As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute

and in certain cases we may deny your requests as permitted by law. For example, we may deny

your request if we cannot verify your identity or confirm that the personal information that we

maintain relates to you, or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on

behalf of another individual. In other instances, we may deny your request where an exception

applies, such as where the disclosure of personal information would adversely affect the rights

and freedoms of another consumer or where the personal information that we maintain about you

is not subject to the CCPA. You have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination or retaliation

for exercising your rights under the CCPA.



If you are a California resident, you (or your authorized agent) may make the following requests:



(1) Request to Know (Access)



You may request that we disclose to you the following information covering the 12 months

preceding your request and as far back as January 1, 2022:



• The categories of personal information we collected about you;

• The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.



(2) Request to Delete



You may request that we delete personal information we collected from you. Once your personal

information is deleted, we won’t be able to get it back for you. If required by law, we will grant a

request to delete information, but you should note that in many situations we must keep your

personal information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our

agreements, or for other business purposes.



(3) Request to Correct



You may request that we correct personal information about you that is no longer accurate or that

is incorrect.



Please note that while a CCPA request to correct may be denied if your personal information is

subject to GLBA and is not covered by CCPA, there are other methods in place that allow you to

correct or update your personal account information. To update your email address, phone

number and mailing address, you can login to your account via web or mobile app and select the

"Personal Info" tab and follow the prompts therein. For updates to social security number, date of

birth, legal name changes or misspelling requests or for any information on changes to personal

information, please refer to the telephone number on the back of your card.



(4) Opt-Out of Sharing Personal Information for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising



Green Dot may share your personal information with advertising partners for the purpose of

delivering interest-based online advertisements to you. You can opt-out of the sharing of your

personal information for this purpose by visiting the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of

the Green Dot website and completing the fields therein. You may also opt-out of other forms of

targeted advertising by submitting a request as described below. Please note that Green Dot does

not sell personal information for monetary value to third parties.

Additionally, if you have enabled a recognized opt-out mechanism on your browser, device or

platform, you will automatically be opted out of any “sharing” of personal information when you

interact with our website. Please visit the Global Privacy Control website to learn more about this

setting and how to enable it on your browser.



You can also opt out of certain targeted advertising by adjusting the privacy settings on your

mobile device (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android).



Please note that your cookie-based preferences will apply only to the specific browser from which

you opt out. You will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers. If you delete cookies,

change web browsers, reset your mobile advertising ID, or use a different device, you may need

to opt out again. Our online services do not function differently in response to browser "Do Not

Track" signals, but you may opt out of certain targeted advertising as described above.



Submitting CCPA Requests



To exercise the CCPA rights described above, you may submit a request by clicking here or

calling us at 833-937-0515. In an effort to protect your personal information from unauthorized

access, deletion or correction and/or to prevent fraud or theft of your personal information and

any of your assets, we will verify and respond to your request consistent with applicable law,

taking into account the type and sensitivity of the personal information subject to the request.

Upon receiving a request, we will attempt to verify your identity by comparing the identifying

information you provide with your request (e.g., your name and mailing address) to the personal

information already maintained in our records. We may need to request additional personal

information from you, such as your email address or telephone number, in order to verify your

identity and protect against fraudulent requests. If you maintain a password-protected account

with us, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account

and require you to re-authenticate yourself before disclosing or deleting your personal information.

If you make a request to delete or correct, we may ask you to confirm your request before we

delete or correct your personal information.



If we are subsequently unable to confirm your identity, we may refuse your rights request. We will

not use personal information we collect in connection with verifying or responding to your request

for any purpose other than responding to your request.



Authorized Agents



If you want to make a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a California resident, you may

make a Request to Know, Request to Delete, or Request to Correct by clicking here or calling us

at 833-937-0515. As part of our verification process, we may request that you provide:



• A power of attorney from the California resident pursuant to Probate Code sections 4121-

4130; or



• A completed Authorized Agent Designation Form signed by the California resident that

you are submitting a request on behalf. Green Dot will provide you with a copy of this form

for completion after you have submitted the request.



If the authorized agent does not provide documentation showing that the authorized agent has

power of attorney to act on the resident’s behalf, then the resident will also be required to

9



independently verify their own identity directly with us and directly confirm that the resident

provided the authorized agent permission to submit the rights request on their behalf.



California – Employees of Businesses



California residents that are employees of businesses that have a business relationship with

Green Dot have all of the rights described in the “Rights and Requests” bullet of the “Privacy

Disclosures for California Residents” Section above, and employees of businesses may submit

requests as described above. We may collect personal information about the employees of other

businesses in the ordinary course of the business relationship between Green Dot and their

employer, such as the employee’s name and work email address. Examples of business

relationships include, but are not limited to, vendors, service providers, contractors, partners,

clients and consultants of Green Dot.



Green Dot collects and uses personal information of business employees for operational

purposes in performing or receiving services pursuant to the nature of the business relationship

between Green Dot and your employer. While we may disclose personal information of business

employees for business purposes, we do not sell or share personal information of business
