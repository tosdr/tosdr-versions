VIZ Media Privacy Policy
------------------------

Effective Date July 1, 2023 (last updated July 1, 2023)

* * *

**About This Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy ("Policy") describes the privacy practices for websites owned and operated by VIZ Media, LLC ("VIZ Media", "we", "us", and "our") and VIZ Media's mobile websites, smart phone applications, programming, and services (each, a "Site" and collectively, the "Sites").

Please note that if you are located in the United Kingdom and European Economic Area ("EEA") and interact with us through the Sites or otherwise, specific rules apply to your privacy rights (as set forth below) in addition to the general provisions set out in this Policy that apply to everyone. If you are a resident of California, you may have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act. Please see the "[California Privacy Notice](#ccpa)" below for more information.

By otherwise accessing, using, or interacting with the Sites, you expressly consent to our collection, processing, use, disclosure, and retention of your information as described in this Policy. If you do not agree with these practices, please do not use the Sites or otherwise provide us with your information.

**Information We Collect**

**Contact information:** If you register for a promotion or program, create an account or profile, or if you request responses or updates from us, we might collect information necessary to identify and contact you. This information may include your name, street address, phone number, and/or email information.

**Payment information:** If you make purchases or subscribe to services through or for our Sites, we might collect your credit card information to process the payment. Please note that after 2 years of payment inactivity, we delete the payment profile.

We may share your information as follows:

You can choose whether or not to share personal information. If you choose not to share, some parts of our Sites and some services may be more difficult or impossible to use. If you reject or turn off cookies or tracking tools, parts of our Site and services may be effected and/or not work properly.

The Sites are not intended for children under 13 years old. We take steps on these sites to avoid collecting information online from children under 13.

**Security**

We use industry standard means to protect our Sites and your information. The Internet is not 100% secure, though. We thus cannot promise that your use of our Sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet.

Online access to your personal information is protected with a password you select. We strongly recommend that you do not share your password.

**Links**

Our Sites contain links to third party sites. If you click on one of those links, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This Policy does not apply to the information practices of that website. You should read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for such third party's sites.

**California Privacy Rights**

If you live in California and have an established business relationship with us, you can request a list of the personal information we have shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. We will also give you a list of the third parties that have received your information. You can make a request one time each year.

To exercise your rights, you can [email us](mailto:privacypolicy@viz.com) or write to us at the address in the "More Questions" section above. Mention in your letter that you are making a "California Shine the Light" inquiry. We will respond within 30 days.

However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
* You have the right to withdraw your previously given consent at any time.

#### VIZ Media and Our Tracking Tools

* * *

**Tracking Technologies We Use**

We or our third-party vendors use several common tracking tools. These may include browser cookies and Flash cookies. Cookies are small files which are stored on your computer designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to you and our Sites. We may also use web beacons and similar visitor activity tracking technologies. We use these tools to track our customers and Site visitors and provide tailored services and Site experience. We also use them for other business purposes, including:

* To track new visitors to our Sites.
* To recognize past customers.
* To store your password if you are registered on our Sites.
* To serve you with advertising content in which we think you will be interested. As part of this customization, we may observe your behaviors on this Site or on other websites. We may also get information about your browsing history from our trusted business partners.
* So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our Site visitors, and their respective interests.
* To recognize the country code from your IP address so we can provide you with customized and proper Site experience and content.

**Controlling Our Use of Tracking Technologies**

You may control our use of cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You can set your browser to reject browser cookies. To control Flash cookies, which we may use on certain Sites from time to time, you can go [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). Why? Because Flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.

NOTE: If you set your computer to block cookies, you may not be able to use or access certain features on our Sites.

**About Our Ads on Other Websites**

We may also work with online advertising companies to provide you with advertising that is as relevant and useful as possible and in the process, such online advertising companies may use cookies and other technologies to collect data. We may provide this advertising on our Sites and other third party sites that you visit. These ads may be based on information you submit on our Sites or third-party sites. They may also be based on your activities or behaviors on our Sites or on third-party sites. The information gathered may be used to serve you with advertisements on our Sites or on third party websites. This includes mobile websites or applications.

**Opting Out of Receiving/Seeing Tracking-Based Ads**

We sometimes work with vendors to provide you with online ads. What ads you see may be based on your activities on our Site or third-party sites. To opt out of having your online behavior tracked for advertising purposes, click [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**Nevada**

We do not sell your personal information as that term is defined under Nevada Law (Section Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes). However, if you are a Nevada resident and wish to exercise the right to opt-out of sale, please email us at [privacypolicy@viz.com](mailto:privacypolicy@viz.com).

#### California Privacy Notice

* * *

**Your Rights Under the California Consumer Privacy Act**

This California Privacy Notice supplements the VIZ Media Privacy Policy ("Policy") at https://www.viz.com/privacy and contains the disclosures required under the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CCPA"). For individuals who are California residents, the CCPA requires certain disclosures about the categories of personal information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from whom we collect personal information, and the third parties with whom we share it.

Please note that for California residents and for purposes of this California Privacy Notice, the term "personal information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household as defined in the CCPA. All capitalized terms not defined in this California Privacy Notice have the same meanings as given them in the Policy

If you are a California resident, you may exercise your rights under the CCPA and submit your requests in one of the following methods: (a) by submitting [this online form](https://www.viz.com/company/ccpa_form); or (b) by calling the following toll free number: 1-888-226-0650.

NOTE: we do not sell your personal information as that term is defined in the CCPA.

You have the right to request VIZ Media to:

* Disclose what personal information the business has collected about you, including the categories of personal information, the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information, the categories of third parties with whom we disclose personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you ("Request to Know");
* Delete the personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions ("Request to Delete");
* Correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you ("Request to Correct");
* Opt you out of the sharing of your personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. To opt-out of the sharing of your personal information, please use the following online form or you may choose to enable online, where available, a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt-out preferences, such as the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"). We will process the GPC signal as a request to opt out; and
* Not provide discriminatory treatment for the exercise of privacy rights conferred by the CCPA, including an employee’s, applicant’s, or independent contractor’s right to not be retaliated against for the exercise of their CCPA rights.

We do not offer a right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive personal information because, within the meaning of the CCPA, we do not use sensitive personal information for inferring characteristics.

We do not offer a right to opt-out of the sale of personal information because, within the meaning of the CCPA, we do not sell personal information.

In order to submit a request, we will need to verify your identity. If you have an account with us through the Site that is password-protected, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account.

If you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns "categories" of personal information collected, we can request from you two data points of personal information to verify your identity. If you do not have an account with us, and your request concerns specific personal information or sensitive personal information, we can request from you at least three data points of personal information as well as a signed declaration with penalty of perjury to verify your identity.

Please note that following your verified request, we will send you your personal information from the following email address: customersupportrep@viz.com (Any response to your request, including any personal information, may be sent as an encrypted file).

Please note that once you have submitted a Request to Know, Request to Delete or Request to Correct, we will send you a receipt, acknowledging your request, within 10 business days. If, for some reason, you do not receive such a receipt within 10 business days of your submitted request, please send us an email to [privacypolicy@viz.com](mailto:privacypolicy@viz.com) as an error may have occurred.

We will process and respond to your Request to Know, Request to Delete or Request to Correct within 45 calendar days after it is received (in some cases, as is allowed under the CCPA, this process may be extended by an additional 45 calendar days).

Please note, that you can only make two Requests to Know in a 12-month period.

As a California resident, you also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. We may require proof that you have designated the authorized agent to act on your behalf and to verify your identity directly with us. Please contact us at [privacypolicy@viz.com](mailto:privacypolicy@viz.com) for more information if you wish to submit a request through an authorized agent.

We hereby inform you that if you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, we may not deny you goods or services for that reason, or subject you to different prices than those paid by other consumers, unless provided otherwise under the CCPA, federal, or state law.
