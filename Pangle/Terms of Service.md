-------------------------

**7.1. Reporting:** Before the eighth (8th) Business Day of each month, Pangle shall provide Partner with a written report setting out the Performance Data for the immediately preceding month.

  

**7.2. Performance Data:** As between Pangle and Partner, Pangle shall be deemed the exclusive owner of any and all Performance Data. Performance Data shall be deemed "Confidential Information" of Pangle and shall be subject to confidentiality provisions set out in this Agreement. Partner agrees that it shall only use the Performance Data for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and shall not disclose any Performance Data to any third party except with the prior written approval of Pangle. Without limiting other possible use cases, Pangle shall be entitled to share Performance Data with Buyers and use Performance Data (both on a user-level and on an aggregated level) in case studies and white papers for its marketing and promotional purposes.

  

**7.3. Discrepancy:** If there is any discrepancy between the Performance Data measured by Pangle and any data recorded by Partner for a given month, the following shall apply:

**(a)** where the discrepancy in the data recorded by Partner for (i) the number of impressions is no greater than ten percent (10%) of the number of impressions recorded as part of Pangle's Performance Data, and (ii) the number of clicks is no greater than thirty (30%) of the number of clicks recorded as part of Pangle's Performance Data, Pangle's Performance Data shall prevail and form the basis for which the Fees are calculated; and

**(b)** where the discrepancy exceeds the agreed ranges set out in Clause 7.3(a) above, the Parties shall enter into good faith discussion and use reasonable endeavours to agree on the controlling performance data for such month.

  

**7.4.** Partner must notify Pangle in writing of any discrepancy within seven (7) days following receipt of the relevant report referred to in Clause 7.1. Such notice shall be accompanied by all relevant information reasonably required by Pangle (including the number of requests, impressions, clicks, CPM and total income) to assist investigation into the discrepancy. Partner’s failure to notify Pangle on a timely basis in accordance with this Clause 7.4 will constitute Partner’s waiver of the discrepancy.

  

**7.5.** In the event that the Parties are unable to reach agreement on the performance data within sixty (60) days after the date on which Pangle received the notice referred to in Clause 7.4 despite the good faith discussion, the matter shall be deemed a dispute and shall be resolved in accordance with Clause 16.2 of this Agreement.

  

**7.6. Payment Request:** Pangle shall issue a payment request on behalf of Partner on a monthly basis for the Fees incurred during the immediately preceding month based on the Performance Data. Partner agrees to accept payment requests raised by Pangle on its behalf and agrees not to issue separate sales invoices for the Fees payable. Partner shall promptly confirm each payment request via the Pangle Platform user interface.

  

**7.7. Payment:** Upon Partner’s confirmation of the relevant payment request, Pangle shall, subject to any good faith dispute, pay the applicable within thirty (30) Business Days. Partner shall be solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the bank account details and Pangle shall not be in any way liable for any errors so long as Pangle pays the applicable Fees to the bank account nominated by Partner.

  

**7.8. Applicable Threshold:** Where the Fees payable to Partner for a given month is less than the Applicable Threshold, the Parties agree that Pangle shall be entitled to withhold payment of such Fees and postpone the issuance of the corresponding payment request, until such time that the Fees payable to Partner reach the Applicable Threshold. In the event that the Fees payable to Partner at the end of a calendar year is still less than the Applicable Threshold, Pangle shall issue a payment request for such Fees and pay the Fees for the said calendar year within thirty (30) Business Days upon receiving Partner’s confirmation of the said payment request.

  

**7.9. Final Payment:** In the event that this Agreement or Partner’s Account is terminated (other than for Partner’s breach), Pangle shall, subject to any good faith dispute, issue a payment request for and pay to Partner the applicable Fees within thirty (30) days following the end of the calendar month in which this Agreement or Partner’s Account was terminated.

  

**7.10. Tax:** Each Party shall be responsible for paying all applicable taxes and duties imposed by any government entity in connection with this Agreement including any such taxes or duties that may be imposed in connection with that Party’s performance of or entry into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Pangle will not be responsible for any indirect taxes levied on Partner by a tax authority with jurisdiction over Partner. Pangle reserves the right to set off any liability of Partner to Pangle against any liability of Pangle to Partner under this Agreement and/or make deductions or withholdings from the Fees where required by law.

  

**7.11. Currency: All payments to be made under this Agreement shall be in United States Dollars (USD) or any other currency as agreed by the Parties from time to time.**
