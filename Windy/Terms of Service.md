You may purchase a Paid Service through a third party by paying an in-advance subscription fee for a recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase (“**Subscription**”) or by making a one-time purchase. If you purchase a Paid Service through a third party, you acknowledge that separate terms with such third party, in addition to the Agreements, may apply. The specific mode of payment and the period for which the Paid Service is subscribed may vary depending on the respective Paid Service. If you purchase a Subscription, you authorize the respective third party to charge you on behalf of Windy for each respective recurring interval until you cancel.

For existing users of the given Paid Services, the price changes will take effect at the start of the next period of the Subscription following the date of the price change. You accept the new price by continuing to use the respective Paid Service after the price change takes effect. In the case of price changes for Subscriptions, Windy will, on its own behalf or through the respective third party through which you purchased the Subscription, notify you in advance of any price changes and, if applicable, instruct you on how to accept these changes.

By providing such details, you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for a Subscription to the relevant Paid Service on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring basis or other interval that we provide to you in advance. If you do not want to accept this charge, you must cancel the applicable paid Subscription through the third party according to their terms of service.
        
    2. We reserve the right to determine your eligibility for a Trial and withdraw or modify such Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability.

    2. If you register for a Subscription, or make a one-time purchase, you may change your mind for any or no reason and withdraw from the relevant Paid Service within 14 days from the day you sign up for the Subscription, or make the purchase (the “**Withdrawal Period**”).
        
    3. By signing up for a Subscription, or making a one-time purchase, you explicitly request us to start providing the respective Paid Service to you immediately and, therefore, before the end of the respective Withdrawal Period.

The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current Subscription period.

The License that you grant to Windy is unlimited in terms of territory and quantity and shall be provided for the duration of the proprietary copyright of such User Content. You grant the License to Windy free of charge. Windy is not obliged to use the License. Windy is entitled to grant the License, as a whole or in part, to third parties, either in the form of a sub-license or assignment of these rights, this all without any restriction, for a fee or free of charge. Therefore, the User Content may also be used in the manner specified herein by third parties. The License shall survive the termination of your use of the Services. Your removal of the User Content shall not affect the License, and Windy as well as third parties shall be entitled to continue using the User Content in line with the License; however, it may be anonymized by Windy.
