Services we provide and the general scope of processing of personal data
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Services. The company provides a global weather tracking and forecasting application, which can be customized to a certain extent according to Users’ preferences on their own devices through the Website and the App. The Users may also contribute to the Services by adding their own camera and/or weather station, which will then provide more relevant local information to us as well as to other users. The Users may also decide to register, and in such case, personal settings are saved in the profile and synchronized across devices used with that account. The Windy Stations, and API Services are provided only to registered users. The content shared through the Community Service can also be accessed by non-registered Users, but only after registration any content can be added. The Services are offered both for free and for subscription. Users with subscription can use a wider range of tools and are offered with extra features such as 1-hour forecast view, 10-day forecast outlook, forecast updates at least 4 times a day, more detailed forecast maps, unlimited Favorites and Alerts, 12-hour loop for Radar and Satellite, Satellite archive and many others as currently offered and provided.
    
2. Legal grounds for personal data processing. Our processing of your personal data will typically be based on one of the following processing legal bases:
    
    * because we need to process your data in order **to provide you with the Services** or a particular feature of the Services, i.e. to perform our contract (meaning also an informal relationship) with you. You can find the full wording of the contract/relationship you conclude with us by using the Services in respective Terms of Use (accessible via our website);
        
    * because such processing is necessary for the purposes of the **legitimate interests** pursued either by us or by a third party and such legitimate interests are not overridden by your privacy or related rights as an individual. Our legitimate interests include e.g. the necessary maintenance of our infrastructure, statistical analysis of the use of the Services, and protection of our legally protected rights;
        
    * because we are legally obliged to do so, for example, we are called upon to disclose your personal data to **public authorities**; or
        
    * because you have provided us with your specific, informed, freely-given, and unambiguous consent; we may periodically **ask for your further consent** to use your personal data for certain specific reasons.
        
3. Scope of processed personal data. In order to provide and maximize your experience with the Services, we may need to collect and use certain information from our Users, some of which could be considered ‘personal data’ within the meaning of the GDPR or other relevant privacy legislation applicable in your country. If we can use the information, alone or in combination, to reasonably identify you as an individual, we treat the information as personal data.
    
    Please note that you may choose to provide us with certain **optional or additional information** when you interact with the Services, in particular, in the following ways:
    
    * Send us an **email message** to receive additional information – for example, you might email us with a question and we will use your email address to respond to your inquiry;
        
    * **Submit a comment or other content** like feedback and suggestions to make our services more accurate or valid (e.g. reports relating to webcams such as wrong location, poor image quality, other issue, etc. – such information is manually reviewed), or send us a photo or video – for example, you might submit a cool photo of a weather event you experienced that we may post on the Services so others can enjoy it.
        
        Special Note about Content Submissions. The Services may offer areas (**community, articles**) where you and other users can post or otherwise submit information, photos, videos, graphics, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, ratings, or other materials on or to the Services (collectively, "**Submissions**"). Any geolocation information, tags, or other metadata in such Submissions may become publicly available. Any information, including personal data, in your Submissions can be read, collected and used by others. We cannot control and are not responsible for how others may use the information contained in your Submissions;
        
    * **Customize the Services** – for example, you might set a "**home" location** so that every time you visit the Services, you automatically receive a display of the weather for that home location.
        
    
    _This data is provided by you to the extent you wish to benefit from the respective functionalities of our Services. The processing legal basis for this purpose is the performance of a contract._
    
    The extent to which we process personal data in general depends on whether you use the Windy Services as a registered **or non-registered user**.
    
4. General processing personal data of all Users (both registered and non-registered)
    
    1. **Statistical and measurement data.** In addition to the processing of your personal data as outlined for the particular Services in Chapter 3 below, we generally process your personal data also for statistical and analytical purposes.
        
        We also collect statistical and measurement data through automated means from Google Analytics. Although the data present in Google Analytics reports is anonymized and we are not able to associate it with you, please note that Google itself collects your IP address. More information about Google Analytics can be found [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245). For the similar reasons we also use other services, such as BigQuery (more information about Google BigQuery can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/data-governance)).
        
        For example, we automatically collect:
        
        * Information about your device and device capabilities;

        This information helps us to understand, analyze, and measure how users use the Services; manage the Services' operations; diagnose problems; recognize repeat visitors; and facilitate your access to and use of the Services.
        
        _The processing legal basis for this purpose is the performance of a contract and our legitimate interest in the effective operation, enhancement and further development of the Services._
        
    2. **Third party technologies** that we use in our infrastructure can produce technical logs with your IP address; we do not perform any analysis or data mining with this data (and delete it regularly, usually after one month). If any personal data is processed (your IP address), such data is used only to operate and improve such technologies.
        
    
    _The processing legal basis for this purpose is such third party’s legitimate interest in operating and improving their technologies._
    
5. Processing personal data of registered Users only
    
    1. **User account registration:** When you choose to register a user account, you will be required to provide your email address and username.
        
        This data is provided by you if you wish to create a user account and benefit from the respective functionalities of our Website and the App (or our [Community](http://community.windy.com/) site and other Services – please see further chapters). We also use it to communicate with you in this regard.
        
        _The processing legal basis for this purpose is the performance of a contract._
        
        _We may further use this data to analyze, improve, enhance, and fine-tune our products and the Services. The processing legal basis for this purpose is our legitimate interest in operating, enhancing and further developing the Services._
        
    2. **Social Login via Facebook, Google or Apple.** You can register a user account or log in by linking your Facebook, Google or Apple account via a service called Social Login, which is an easy, secure, and straightforward way to register with us or log in into our Services quickly.
        
        If you connect Facebook, Google or Apple to your Windy account, we will use your name, profile picture and email address for registration and authentication purposes so you can benefit from the respective functionalities of our [Community](http://community.windy.com/) site and other Services. We also use it to communicate with you in this regard.
        
        _The processing legal basis for this purpose is the performance of a contract._
        
        We may further use this data, and some of your other public information from these accounts, to analyze, improve, enhance, and fine-tune our products and the Services.
        
        _The processing legal basis for this purpose is our legitimate interest in operating, enhancing and further developing the Services._
        
        When using Social Login services via Apple/Google/Facebook account on the Website or in the App, the Company collects and processes your personal information from the company Apple Inc. (name, email address, language setting and profile photo), Google, Inc. (name, email address, language setting and profile photo) or Meta Platforms, Inc. (name, email address and profile photo) for the purpose of user account registration/log-in.
        
        The amount of information we are able to access is dependent on the privacy policy and the settings of your third-party accounts. These settings, in a combination with what Windy asks for, determines the extent of the data that can be accessed. Windy account can be disconnected from the linked third-party account at any time. For more information about Social Login, please follow our community article: [information-about-user-profile](https://community.windy.com/topic/20330/information-about-user-profile).
        
    3. **Marketing.** We may also use your email address for direct marketing. If we send you electronic marketing messages based on our legitimate interest or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may, at any time, declare your objection. Any electronic marketing messages you receive from us will include an opt-out mechanism within the message itself, e.g. an ‘unsubscribe’ link in the email you receive from us.
