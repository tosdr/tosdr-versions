==============================

_Looking for eMoods Classic/Reporting app Privacy Policy? [Click here](https://emoodtracker.com/emoods-classic-reporting-app-privacy-policy)_

**Last updated**: November 4, 2021

This Privacy Policy (“**Policy**”) describes the ways that Yottaram LLC, a Maine limited liability corporation (“**We**” or “**Us**”) collects, receives, uses, retains, and discloses Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and, to the extent applicable, Protected Health Information (”PHI”) about you, the user of the eMoods Insights Software-as-a-Service product found accessible at [https://insights.emoodtracker.com](https://insights.emoodtracker.com/) (the “**Service**”). PII includes information about you that is personally identifying such as your name, email address, and phone number and which is not otherwise publicly available. PHI includes information relating to your health, for example medical history, health conditions, physician and insurance information and other data that a healthcare professional may collect to identify an individual and determine appropriate care. PHI is protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and applicable state law. This information may be provided by you online or offline, or may be collected by us from other methods such as through a physician or other health care provider. We protect covered health and medical information to the extent required by HIPAA and applicable state law. Similarly, we may use covered health and medical information as permitted by HIPAA and applicable state law. PII and PHI may include other types of information depending on the legal definition that applies in your physical location. Only the definitions of PII and PHI that apply in your location will apply to you under this Privacy Policy. PII and PHI are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as “PIIPersonal Data.”

This Privacy Policy (“**Policy**”) describes the ways that Yottaram LLC, a Maine limited liability corporation (“**We**” or “**Us**”) collects, uses and shares about you, the user of the eMoods Insights Software-as-a-Service product accessible at [https://insights.emoodtracker.com](https://insights.emoodtracker.com/) (the “**Service**”). This Policy applies to personally identifiable information that we collect from you, and from third parties about you (“**PII**”), through the Service.

This Policy does not apply to PII collected by:

* The eMoods classic mobile application, whose collection, use and disclosure of information is disclosed in its own separate [privacy policy](https://emoodtracker.com/emoods-classic-reporting-app-privacy-policy);
* us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by us or any third party; or
* any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible via the Service.

### AGREEMENT

By visiting, accessing or using the Service, and/or by providing PII to Yottaram LLC, you accept and hereby expressly consent to our collection, use, retention, and disclosure of your PII in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you choose not to provide the requested information you will not be able to access the Site or Service.

Note to HIPAA Covered Entities: The eMoods Insights Service is not an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) service, nor does it provide for the storage and maintenance of medical records and should not be used as such by any clinician/healthcare providers using the Service. As a Covered Entity, you remain solely responsible for maintaining original medical records of any patient. In the event you create new/original content through use of the Service, you agree, to the extent applicable, to incorporate such content into your existing EMR and shall not rely on the Service to store or maintain such content as an “original” medical record.

Moreover, if you are a HIPAA Covered Entity and you are using the eMoods Insights Service, you agree to also be bound by the Business Associate Agreement attached as an Addendum to this Privacy Policy and incorporated fully into the accompanying [Terms of Service](https://emoodtracker.com/emoods-insights-software-as-a-service-agreement).

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to check the most recent modification date to ensure that you are aware of any changes in our use of your PII. **Your continued use of the Service after any change means that you expressly, explicitly, voluntarily and unambiguously agree to any such change or modification.**
