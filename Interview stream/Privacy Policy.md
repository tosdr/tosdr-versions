**Privacy Policy**
==================

**This Privacy Policy was last updated on March 23rd, 2021**
------------------------------------------------------------

This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how the personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you may provide on the interviewstream.com, rivs.com, hirebar.com, “interviewstream” mobile application, and any of their related products and services (collectively, “Services”) is collected, protected and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and interviewstream, Inc. (“interviewstream, Inc.”, “we”, “us” or “our”) and its subsidiaries (Thrive, and InterviewGuide Builder). By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.

**Automatic collection of information**
---------------------------------------

When you open the Website or use the Mobile Application, our servers automatically record information that your browser or device sends. This data may include information such as your device’s IP address and location, browser, and device name and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Services, pages of the Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, the information you search for on the Services, access times and dates, and other statistics.

Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.

**Collection of personal information**
--------------------------------------

In order to become a registered user of the Services, interviewstream requires you to create a user account. To register for a user account, you must provide the following personally identifiable information:

* If you are an employer, you must provide your company’s name and e-mail address of a contact at your company.
* If you are an employee of an employer, you must provide your name, e-mail address, and phone.
* If you are a jobseeker, the information that you need to provide is determined by the employer who is using interviewstream to review candidates for their job opening or similar opportunity.

When required, this information may include the following:

* Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
* Contact information such as email address, address, etc.
* Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.
* Geolocation data such as latitude and longitude.

**Use and processing of collected information**
-----------------------------------------------

In order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:

* Create and manage user accounts
* Deliver products or services
* Improve products and services
* Respond to inquiries and offer support
* Request user feedback
* Improve the user experience
* Run and operate the Services

Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.

Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

**Managing information**
------------------------

You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.

**Disclosure of information**
-----------------------------

Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.

We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.

**Retention of information**
----------------------------

We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

**Transfer of information**
---------------------------

Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.

**Choice and access to data controlled by our customers**
---------------------------------------------------------

The employer is responsible for complying with the individual’s request. If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. interviewstream retains an archive copy of the individual’s personal data we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed to provide services to our Customer and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
